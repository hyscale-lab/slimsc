Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. Hmm, let me think.

I remember that pinacol rearrangement involves a vicinal diol, meaning two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. Under acidic conditions, one of the OH groups gets protonated, then a 1,2-hydride shift happens. This leads to the formation of a ketone and a rearrangement of the molecule.

So the first part of the question is about reaction A. The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. Wait, let me visualize that structure. It's a cyclohexanone ring with two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon (carbon 2) and the ketone on carbon 1.

So the starting material A must undergo the rearrangement to form this product. In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol loses a water molecule. So the starting diol would have two adjacent OH groups, right?

So if the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, the starting diol must have been a cyclohexanol derivative with two OH groups next to each other. Wait, but let me think. The rearrangement forms a ketone, so the diol must have been in a position that allows the hydride shift to form the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the diol is on a cyclohexane ring. Let me imagine the structure of A. The product is 1-ketocyclohexane with two p-tolyl groups on C2. So the starting diol would have been a cyclohexane with two adjacent OH groups, perhaps on C1 and C2, and p-tolyl groups attached.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So that would be a cyclohexanol where the 1-position has a CH2OH group attached, and that CH2 is also attached to two p-tolyl groups. Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me parse that correctly.

Wait, the formula is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So the cyclohexanol (OH on C1) has a methyl group attached to C1 as well. That methyl group is substituted with two p-tolyl groups and a hydroxyl group? No, wait. Let me break it down.

The substituent is hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl. So the methyl group has a hydroxyl group and two p-tolyl groups attached. So it's like (p-tolyl)â‚‚CH-OH attached to the cyclohexanol.

Wait, but wait. Di-p-tolyl would mean two p-tolyl groups attached to the same carbon. So the substituent on the cyclohexane is a CH2 group that's connected to two p-tolyl groups and an OH? Or maybe it's a CH group with two p-tolyl substituents and an OH?

Wait, perhaps the structure is that the cyclohexanol has a side chain where the adjacent carbon to the OH has two p-tolyl groups and another OH. So like, the diol is on a cyclohexane, and the adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) each have an OH, but wait, no, pinacol is a vicinal diol, so the two OHs are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexane with an OH on C1 and another OH on a methyl group attached to C1. Let me think.

Alternatively, the starting material is 1,2 diol on a cyclohexane ring. But looking at the options, option A's starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So cyclohexan-1-ol (OH on C1) with a substituent on C1 which is a -CH(OH)(di-p-tolyl) group. So the structure would be a cyclohexanol where C1 has another group that is a methyl group with two p-tolyl groups and an OH.

Wait, that would mean that the two OH groups are on the same carbon (the methyl group attached to C1), but that's not possible because the Pinacol rearrangement requires two adjacent OH groups on different carbons. Oh wait, no, because the substituent is on C1, but the other OH is on the same substituent, so maybe the structure is a diol where the two OHs are on adjacent carbons (C1 and the adjacent methyl group).

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a structure where the cyclohexane ring has an OH on C1, and a methyl group attached to C1 that has another OH on it. So the two OHs are on C1 and the adjacent methyl group, making them vicinal diols. So under acid, one OH gets protonated, and a hydride shift occurs.

When the rearrangement happens, the protonated OH would lose a water, and the hydride from the adjacent carbon (the methyl) would shift. The product would have the ketone at C1, and the other substituents would adjust accordingly.

Wait, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at C1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2. That suggests that during the rearrangement, the p-tolyl groups moved to C2.

So the starting material must have the p-tolyl groups on the adjacent carbon to the OH groups.

Wait, perhaps in the starting material, the diol is on a cyclohexane ring where the adjacent carbon (to the OH) is connected to two p-tolyl groups.

Let me sketch this out mentally. The starting material would be a cyclohexane with OH on C1, and a CH2 group attached to C1. That CH2 has two p-tolyl groups and another OH. Wait, but that would make the two OHs on the same carbon (the CH2), which isn't a vicinal diol. Oh wait, no, because one is on C1 of the cyclohexane, and the other is on the CH2 group attached to C1. So the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, C1 and the CH2's carbon. So that's a vicinal diol.

When acid is added, one OH is protonated. A hydride shift occurs from the CH2 (which has two p-tolyl groups) to the adjacent C1 (which has the OH). The shift would form a carbocation on the CH2, and the adjacent proton would leave as water, leading to the formation of a ketone on C1. The two p-tolyl groups would remain on the CH2, which is now attached to C2 of the cyclohexane (since the shift moves the substituents over).

Wait, but in the product, the two p-tolyl groups are on C2 of the cyclohexane. So the starting material would have the diol on C1 and the CH2 (with two p-tolyl groups and an OH) on C1. Then, the hydride shift would move from the CH2's carbon to C1, causing the formation of a carbocation on the CH2. Then, the H from the adjacent OH would leave as water, leading to the formation of the ketone on C1. The CH2 would now be attached to C2 of the cyclohexane, but since it's a carbocation, perhaps it loses a proton to form a double bond? Or maybe the two p-tolyl groups are on the same carbon, which after the shift, becomes C2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the mechanism again.

In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol is protonated, leading to the formation of a good leaving group (water). Then, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon. This forms a carbocation on that adjacent carbon, and the leaving group departs, forming a double bond with the adjacent carbon. Wait, no, the hydride shift leads to a carbocation adjacent to the leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the diol is (R)C-OH and (R')C-OH, with R and R' being adjacent. Upon protonation, one OH becomes -OH2+, which leaves as water, forming a carbocation. The adjacent carbon (which had the other OH) donates a hydride, leading to a carbocation shift. Then, the carbocation would form a double bond or perhaps form a ketone if there's an adjacent group.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the specific starting material.

Looking at the options, for reaction A, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is on C1, and two p-tolyl groups are on C2.

So the starting material must have the two OH groups adjacent to each other, with the p-tolyl groups on the same carbon as one of the OHs.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,2-diol on a cyclohexane ring, where one of the OHs is on C1 and the other is on a methyl group attached to C2, which has two p-tolyl substituents.

Wait, but the options for A in the choices are for the starting material. Let me look at the options:

Option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the substituent is a hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl group attached to C1 of cyclohexanol.

Wait, hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl would be a methyl group with two p-tolyl groups and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexanol where the C1 has a methyl group attached, and that methyl has two p-tolyls and an OH. So that would make the structure have two OHs on the same carbon (the methyl group). But that's a geminal diol, not a vicinal diol. Oh wait, that can't be right because the Pinacol rearrangement requires vicinal diols.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the two OHs are on the same carbon, it's not a vicinal diol. So that would not undergo the Pinacol rearrangement. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol where the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, each connected to a p-tolyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a cyclohexane with an OH on C1 and another OH on C2, which is attached to a methyl group that has two p-tolyl groups. No, that might not make sense.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a 1,2-diol where one of the carbons (say, C1) has the OH and a methyl group with two p-tolyl substituents. Then, when the rearrangement happens, the hydride shifts from the methyl group (C2) to C1, forming the ketone on C1, and the p-tolyl groups would end up on C2.

So the product would have the ketone on C1 and the two p-tolyl groups on C2. That makes sense.

So the starting material is a 1,2-diol where C1 has the OH and C2 has a CH2 group with two p-tolyl groups and an OH. Wait, but that would make the diol on C1 and C2, both with OH groups.

Wait, but in the formula given in option A, the substituent is hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl on C1 of the cyclohexanol. So that would be a cyclohexanol with a methyl group attached to C1. The methyl group has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the structure would be:

Cyclohexanol (OH on C1) with a CH2 group attached to C1. The CH2 has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the two OHs are on C1 (the main ring) and the CH2 group. Those are adjacent, so it's a vicinal diol.

Wait, but the CH2 group is a substituent on C1, so the OHs are on the same carbon? No, because the main ring's C1 has an OH, and the substituent is a CH2 group attached to C1, which has another OH. So the two OHs are on C1 (ring) and the CH2 (which is attached to C1), so they're on adjacent carbons? No, because the CH2 is a substituent, so the two OHs are on the same carbon (C1), which doesn't make sense for a vicinal diol.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right. Let's think again.

If the starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, that would mean that the cyclohexanol has a substituent on C1 which is a CH2 group (methyl) that has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the substituent is CH(OH)(p-tolyl)â‚‚. Wait no, that's a CH group with three substituents, which is not possible.

Wait, the substituent is hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl. So the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) attached to the cyclohexane, and on that methyl group, there's a hydroxyl group and two p-tolyl groups. So the substituent is:

CH2-OH and CH2-(p-tolyl)â‚‚? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's a methyl group where the methyl has two p-tolyl groups and a hydroxyl. So that would be a 3-substituted methyl group, which isn't possible because a methyl has only one carbon.

Wait, maybe it's a geminal diol? No, that's not right because pinacol requires a vicinal diol.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(OH)(p-tolyl)2 group. That would make the substituent on C1 a CH group with an OH and two p-tolyl groups. So the structure would have OH on C1 (cyclohexanol) and another OH on the adjacent CH group. So that's a vicinal diol.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the starting material is a cyclohexanol where C1 has a substituent that is a CH group bearing two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the diol is on C1 and the adjacent CH group.

So when acid is added, one of the OH groups gets protonated. Then, a 1,2-hydride shift occurs. The hydrogen from the CH group moves to the adjacent C1 (which is protonated), forming a carbocation on the CH group. Then, the leaving group (water) departs, leading to the formation of a double bond or a ketone.

Wait, no, the hydride shift would form a carbocation on the CH group, but after the shift, the carbocation would be on that carbon. Then, the nearby OH (from the original diol) would lose a proton, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think about the mechanism again.

In the Pinacol rearrangement, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons. One gets protonated, making it a good leaving group (as H2O). The adjacent carbon (which has the other OH) donates a hydride to the protonated carbon. This leads to the formation of a carbocation on the adjacent carbon. Then, the carbocation rearranges, possibly leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, for example, if we have (CH3)2C-OH-CH2-OH, under acid, it would protonate one OH, lose water, then a hydride shift from the adjacent CH2 would occur, leading to a ketone.

In the case of the question, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is on C1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2.

So the starting material must have the diol on C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl groups on C2.

Wait, but in option A, the starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So that would have the diol on C1 and the substituent on C1 which has another OH. So the substituent is a methyl group attached to C1, which has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the diol is on C1 and the substituent's carbon.

Wait, but if the substituent is on C1, that's a secondary carbon. So the two OHs are on C1 and the substituent's carbon, which is attached to C1. So the OHs are on adjacent carbons (C1 and substituent's C), making them a vicinal diol. That fits.

So upon rearrangement, the protonation occurs on one of the OHs. Let's say the OH on the substituent. Then, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent C1 to the substituent's C. Wait, no, the hydride would shift from the substituent's C to the protonated C (which is on substituent's C). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Alternatively, the proton is on the substituent's OH. The substituent's C is connected to two p-tolyl groups. So when protonated, the OH on substituent's C becomes -OH2+.

Then, the hydride from C1 (the ring carbon) shifts to substituent's C. This would form a carbocation on C1. Then, the bond breaks, and the ring's C1 loses a proton, forming a double bond. Wait, but that doesn't lead to a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the hydride shifts from the substituent's C to the ring's C1. Wait, that would form a carbocation on the substituent's C. But the substituent has two p-tolyl groups, which are bulky. Maybe that's not favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydride shifts from the ring's C1 to the substituent's C. Let's say the substituent's C is the one with the protonated OH. When the hydride from C1 moves to substituent's C, substituent's C becomes a carbocation. Then, the OH on the ring's C1 (now a protonated alcohol) would lose a proton, leading to a double bond.

Wait, but how does that form a ketone?

Hmm, maybe I should think of the rearrangement in terms of the product. The product is a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2.

So the starting material must have the two OH groups on adjacent carbons, which after rearrangement, the p-tolyl groups end up on C2, and the ketone is on C1.

So the starting material is a diol where the OHs are on C1 and C2 of a cyclohexane ring, and C2 has two p-tolyl groups attached.

So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with an OH on C1 and another OH on C2, which is attached to two p-tolyl groups.

But looking at the options, the starting material for reaction A is either a cyclohexanol or cyclopentanol derivative.

Option A for reaction A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So the substituent is a methyl group on C1 with two p-tolyl groups and an OH.

Wait, but if the substituent is on C1, and the two OHs are on C1 and substituent's C, then the diol is on C1 and substituent's C, which are adjacent.

Upon rearrangement, the substituent's C would lose a OH group (as H2O) and a hydride would shift from C1 to substituent's C, leading to a carbocation on substituent's C. Then, the ring's C1 would lose a proton, forming a double bond. But how does that form a ketone?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the product again.

The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is on C1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2.

So for the rearrangement, the starting material must have a structure where after the hydride shift, the p-tolyl groups end up on C2, and the ketone on C1.

So perhaps the starting material is a diol where one OH is on C1, and the adjacent carbon (C2) has a CH2 group with two p-tolyl groups and another OH.

Wait, but that would be a diol on C1 and C2, with C2 having the substituent. So the structure would be like:

Cyclohexane with OH on C1 and OH on C2, where C2 is connected to a CH2 group with two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, no, that's not matching the options given.

Looking back at the options, option A has A as 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So the substituent is on C1. So the diol is on C1 and substituent's C.

When the rearrangement happens, the substituent's OH would protonate, lose water, and then the hydride shifts from C1 to substituent's C. That would form a carbocation on substituent's C, which then would have two p-tolyl groups. Since the substituent is a methyl group, the carbocation might not be too stable, but perhaps it's possible.

Wait, but after the hydride shift, the ring's C1 would lose a proton, forming a double bond between C1 and substituent's C. But that doesn't form a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the other part of the question.

The second reaction is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 â†’ B.

The product B is one of the options. Let's consider this.

The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. That structure is an ester, with a butanoate (four-carbon chain) where the ester is on C4 (since it's butanoate). The substituents are OH on C2 and C3, and a p-tolyl group on C2.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
||
CH2-C-OH
   |  
   C-OH
   |
   p-tolyl

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The ester is OMe-O-C-O-C-O- ?

Wait, let me write it more clearly:

The molecule is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

That would be:

Butanoate: CH2-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. But with substituents.

But the actual structure is:

At position 2 of the butanoate, there's a hydroxyl group and a p-tolyl group. So the structure would be:

COOCH3 is on C4 (butanoate). C3 has an OH, C2 has an OH and a p-tolyl group.

So the structure is:

CH2-(p-tolyl)-C(OH)(CH2COOCH3)-OH.

Wait, no, but butanoate is four carbons. So the structure is:

CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, but butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COOCH3, but with substituents. So the correct structure would be:

O
|
O-C-OCH3 (that's the ester group on C4)
|
CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-

Wait, no, perhaps the butanoate is:

The butanoate is O=C-OCH3 attached to the fourth carbon (C4). The chain is:

C1: CH2-

C2: C(OH)(p-tolyl)-

C3: CH(OH)-

C4: COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So it's a vicinal diol (OH on C2 and C3), which is a pinacol structure. So under acidic conditions, it should undergo the Pinacol rearrangement.

So the reaction would form a ketone. Let's think about the mechanism.

Protonation of one OH (say, on C3) would make it a better leaving group. Then, the adjacent C2 would donate a hydride (or is it a methyl group?), leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, the structure after protonation would lose water from C3, forming a carbocation on C3. Then, a hydride shift from C2 to C3 would form a carbocation on C2, which could then form a ketone.

Wait, let me see:

The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Structure: CH2-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Upon protonation, one OH (let's say on C3) becomes -OH2+. Then, when it leaves as water, a carbocation forms on C3.

Then, a hydride shift occurs from C2 to C3. C2 has a p-tolyl group and an OH. The OH is on C2. Wait, but the hydride would come from where?

Wait, after losing water from C3, we have a carbocation on C3. The adjacent C2 has a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)), so perhaps a hydride (H-) can shift from C2 to C3, forming a carbocation on C2.

Wait, but C2 has a p-tolyl group and an OH. So after the shift, the carbocation is on C2, which has the p-tolyl group. Then, that carbocation can form a double bond or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the carbocation on C3 forms a double bond with C2, but that's not leading to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the hydride shift leads to the formation of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbocation on C3 would lead to a hydride shift from C2. The structure would then form a carbonyl at C2, with the p-tolyl group.

Wait, so after the shift, the carbocation is on C2. Then, the oxygen from the adjacent group (the ester) could attack, forming a ketone.

Wait, the ester is on C4. So the carbonyl would form between C2 and the rest.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone on C2, with the ester group on C4.

So the product would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Which is option B in the choices for product B.

Looking at the options, product B for option A is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. That matches.

So for the second reaction, the product is that. So the starting material for reaction B leads to product B as in option A.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the second product is either methyl 3-oxo..., or methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo..., etc.

So for reaction B, the product is 3-oxo, which is option A and B for B.

Now, going back to reaction A.

If the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, then the starting material must be a diol on a cyclohexane ring where the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, with the p-tolyl groups on the adjacent carbon.

Looking at the options, option A for reaction A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

So that would have the diol on C1 and the substituent's C (which is adjacent), leading to the product where the ketone is on C1 and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2.

That seems to fit.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, and B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.


The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement involves a vicinal diol reacting under acidic conditions to form a ketone. The mechanism includes protonation of one hydroxyl group, loss of water, and a 1,2-hydride shift, leading to the formation of a carbocation and ultimately a ketone.

### Reaction A:
The product is **2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**, a cyclohexanone with a ketone on C1 and two p-tolyl groups on C2. For this rearrangement, the starting material must be a vicinal diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons, and the p-tolyl groups are positioned to migrate to C2. 

The starting material **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol** fits this description. It is a cyclohexanol derivative with an OH group on C1 and a substituent on C1 that is a methyl group bearing two p-tolyl groups and another OH. This structure ensures the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons (C1 and the substituent's carbon), satisfying the requirement for a vicinal diol. Upon rearrangement, the ketone forms on C1, and the two p-tolyl groups migrate to C2, yielding the product.

### Reaction B:
The starting material is **methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**, a vicinal diol with OH groups on C2 and C3, and a p-tolyl group on C2. Under acidic conditions, one OH group is protonated, water is lost, and a hydride shift occurs from C2 to C3, forming a carbocation on C2. This carbocation is stabilized by the p-tolyl group, and the oxygen from the ester group attacks, forming a ketone on C2. The product is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**, which matches the description in the question.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.  
  This matches the analysis for both reactions.  

- **Option B**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.  
  The starting material A is incorrect because it involves a cyclopentane ring, which does not match the product structure.  

- **Option C**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.  
  Both A and B are incorrect for the same reasons as in Option B.  

- **Option D**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.  
  The starting material A is correct, but the product B is incorrect because it does not match the expected rearrangement product.  

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately identifies the starting materials and products for both reactions.  

**Answer: A**
