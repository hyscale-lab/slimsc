Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question involves identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a reaction. 

Hmm, the reaction was with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in the ring-opening of epoxides. Oh right, it's a bulky base, so maybe it's leading to an acid-catalyzed opening? Or perhaps it's a base-induced ring-opening? Wait, no, wait. Epoxides can be opened by bases, especially under certain conditions. Oh, right, the solvent is nonpolar, so maybe it's a thermal process. So perhaps the compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is a ring-opening, but wait, no. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement or something else.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows: Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, the protons. There are two singlets for 3H each. They could be methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe carbonyls or aromatic rings with strong symmetry? Or perhaps they are attached to a quaternary carbon, like being adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Then, the aromatic region. The signals are at 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), and 7.71 (d, 2H). So two doublets integrating to 1H, and two doublets integrating to 2H each. Wait, this looks like a para-substituted aromatic
