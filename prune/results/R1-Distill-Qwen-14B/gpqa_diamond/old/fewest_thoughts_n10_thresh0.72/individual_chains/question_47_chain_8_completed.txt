Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify an organic compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably N-H or O-H stretches. Wait, but the presence of two bands might suggest either N-H (as in amide) or maybe O-H, but O-H is usually a broad peak around 3200-3600. Alternatively, the two peaks could be from different types of N-H, like in an amide which has two sets of N-H stretches. Or maybe it's an amino group? Wait, but if it's O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But the other IR peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong band. That's a carbonyl group. 1720 is usually a strong indication of an ester or maybe an amide. Wait, amide carbonyls are a bit lower, like around 1650-1700, but esters are higher, around 1720-1750. So maybe it's an ester?

Wait, but the molecular formula has two oxygen atoms. Let's count: C9H11NO2. So, 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 2 oxygens. So, possible functional groups: ester (which would be O from the ester group), maybe an amide (which has a CONR2 group, so another O). Alternatively, perhaps a nitro group? No, but the formula doesn't have enough O for that. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something that splits it into a triplet. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethyl ether.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Hmm, maybe an -OCH2- group. Like in an ethyl ester where the O is attached to a CH2. Wait, but in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have a triplet at around 1.2 and a quartet at 4.1. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, 4.0 ppm could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. Could it be part of an amino group? But amino protons are usually broad, but in this case, it's 2H as a singlet. Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else. Like maybe OCH2CH2 something.

Wait, another peak at 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet suggests a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. So if the 1.20 is a triplet (from CH2CH3), then the quartet at 4.5 would be the neighboring CH2. So that would fit an ethyl group. For example, OCH2CH2CH3 would have the CH2CH3 as triplet around 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5? Or wait, actually, in an ethyl ester (like ethyl acetate), the OCH2CH3 would show up as a quartet around 4.1 ppm, with the CH3 as triplet around 1.2. So that fits with the 4.5 and 1.2 ppm data. Wait, but the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than typical ester OCH2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the quartet is part of an amide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 is a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen or another group. Let me think: If it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2, which is next to another CH2, perhaps as part of an ester. So the ethyl group would be OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's a propyl. Ethyl is OCH2CH3, which would have the OCH2 as quartet (4.1), and the CH3 as triplet (1.2). So why is the quartet at 4.5 here?

Wait, maybe the quartet isn't part of an ethyl ester. Let me think about other possibilities. Another option is a benzamide structure. For example, N-substituted benzamides. Or maybe a formamide.

Looking at the NMR data again:

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets likely correspond to the ortho positions of a substituent, leading to two sets of doublets for the aromatic protons.

So the substituent on the benzene is in the para position, which would split the aromatic protons into two doublets. For example, if it's a substituent like OCH2CH3 (ethoxy), then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Alternatively, if the substituent is an amino group or another group with substituents.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 3420 and 3325, which could be N-H stretches. If the compound is an amide, then that makes sense. So perhaps it's a benzamide with substituents.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy group in the meta position. But then the aromatic protons would be in a meta arrangement, which probably wouldn't give two doublets. Wait, if the substituent is at meta, then the aromatic H's would be a triplet or something else, not two doublets. So that might not fit.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide (HCON-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the substituents are at para positions. The benzene would have ethoxy and formamide groups in para positions. Wait, but would that cause the aromatic protons to be two doublets? Let me imagine the substituents: the ethoxy is para to the formamide group. So the aromatic ring would have two substituents in para positions. That would split the ring into two sets of equivalent H's, each as a doublet. So that fits the NMR data.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to benzene with an NH2 in para. But wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the benzene has NH2 and COO- groups in para. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets. The IR would show N-H (from amine) and a carbonyl (from the ester). So the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which would be the ester carbonyl. The N-H would show up as broad peaks around 3400. So that fits. The NMR would have the ethyl group (CH2CH3) as triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 as quartet. Wait, but in propionate, the ester group is OCH2CH2COO-. So the ethyl group is OCH2CH2-, which in NMR would have the OCH2 at around 4.0-4.2 as a quartet, and the CH2CH3 as triplet at 1.2. So the quartet in NMR is at 4.5, which is a bit high for that. Hmm. Wait, in propionate, the OCH2 would be split into a quartet, but the coupling is with the adjacent CH2, which would be a triplet. So maybe that's not matching exactly. Also, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which doesn't fit with an OCH2 group.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the benzene has NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions. The IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1720, and the N-H (from amine) as broad peaks around 3400. The NMR would have the ethyl group as triplet (1.2) and quartet (4.1-4.2), but in the question, the quartet is at 4.5, which doesn't match. Also, the amine protons would be broad, but in the NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Wait, 4.0 is more likely an OCH2 group, but in ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be around 4.1. Hmm, but in this case, if it's ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would give a quartet at 4.1 and a triplet at 1.2. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, so that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is from an NH2 group? No, because NH2 protons are usually broad and can appear in a range, but 4.0 is a bit high, unless it's an N-attached group.

Wait, going back to each option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). The benzene has an ethoxy group and a formamide group in para positions. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits. The IR: the strong peak at 1720 would be the carbonyl of formamide. Wait, formamide's carbonyl is usually around 1680-1700 cm-1, but maybe it's a bit higher. The medium peaks at ~3400 could be the N-H of the formamide. Formamide has a single N-H, which would show as a broad peak. But question states medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325, which might be two N-H stretches, but formamide only has one. Hmm.

Alternatively, if it's an amide with two N-H groups, like in an amine. Wait, but formamide is a primary amide with one N-H. So maybe option B is less likely.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be the propionyl group attached to benzene with NH2 in para. So the structure is PhNH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the ester group is OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO- as the ester, so the ethyl group would be OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is (CH2)2COO-, so in the ester, it'd be OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-; when esterified, it's OCH2CH2CO-O-R. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The propionate ester would be R-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the propionate would be the propionyl group attached as an ester. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-R. If R is ethyl, then it's ethyl propionate, which has the ester group OCH2CH3. But in this case, the substituent on the benzene would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me clarify: the propionate is the propionyl group as an ester. So the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent -O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, and another substituent -NH2 in para. So the aromatic ring would have two substituents: an ester group and an amino group in para.

In that case, the NMR would show the ethyl group from the ester as triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.1. But in the question, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Also, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet of 2H, which doesn't fit with the OCH2 group. Unless it's something else.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene with NH2 and COOEt groups in para. The ester group is OCH2CH3. So in the NMR, the ethyl group would show up as quartet at ~4.1 and triplet at 1.2. But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Also, the amino group would be -NH2, which typically gives a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, but it's not clear. Wait, in the NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (2H). That doesn't fit with an NH2 group, which would be more like a broad peak, possibly integrating for 2H if it's a secondary amine, but in this case, it's a primary amine. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: the 4.0 ppm peak (bs, 2H) might be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2, but as a singlet. But in ethyl esters, OCH2 would be a quartet. So what else?

Looking back at the NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → likely CH2CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → maybe a CH2 connected to something else, like a nitrogen?

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, implies two neighboring Hs, so maybe another CH2.

Wait, the quartet at 4.5 would be adjacent to a CH2, which has 2 H. So, perhaps this is part of a structure like -OCH2CH2-.

Alternatively, think about an ethyl group connected to an oxygen and another group. For example, OCH2CH2COO-.

Wait, but then the ethyl would be split into quartet and triplet. Let me think: if the group is OCH2CH2COO-, then the OCH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2, so you get a quartet for OCH2 at around 4.1, and a triplet for the CH2CH3 at 1.2. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 and the triplet at 1.2. So that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility is that the quartet at 4.5 is from a CH2 connected to an oxygen and another CH2 connected to something else, like in an acetyloxy group. Hmm, but not sure.

Looking back at the options, let's analyze each.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group in meta. The aromatic protons would be in meta positions, so perhaps as a triplet or other patterns, but not two doublets. So perhaps this can be ruled out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Benzene has formamide group (HCON-) and ethoxy in para. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits. The formamide has a carbonyl, which would explain the 1720 peak in IR. The N-H from formamide would show as a peak in IR around 3400. But formamide has only one N-H, so the IR would have a single peak? But the IR data shows two peaks, 3420 and 3325. Hmm, maybe it's an amine group elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has both an amide and an amine. That's possible, but not sure.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is benzene with NH2 and COO-(CH2)2CH3 in para. The ester group would have OCH2CH2CH3, but wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-; the ester would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the ethyl group would be in the ester. So the NMR would have the ethyl group as triplet (1.2, 3H). The OCH2CH2 would show up as quartet and triplet. But in the data, we have quartet at 4.5, which is higher than typical for OCH2. Also, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) doesn't fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene with NH2 and COOEt in para. The ester's OCH2CH3 would give quartet at 4.1 and triplet at 1.2. But in the data, quartet is at 4.5, so that's a mismatch. Also, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet. If the amine is present, would it show up as a broad singlet? Maybe, but in D, the amine is NH2, which is a primary amine. Primary amines have broad peaks around 1-5 ppm. But the integration is 2H, so maybe it's an -NHR group, but in D it's NH2, which would integrate to 2H as one peak. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR has 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet suggests perhaps an NH group, but 2H. Could it be a CH2 connected to an amine? Like, perhaps a CH2NH group, but I'm not certain. Or maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.

Let me think about the molecular formula: C9H11NO2.

If I break it down, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that add up to the formula.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide (C7H7NO) with ethoxy (C2H5O) → total C9H11NO2. Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO, but adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make it C9H12NO2. Hmm, not matching. Because the formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, maybe I need to count the atoms correctly.

Benzamide is C7H7NO. So the structure is PhCONH2. If we have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), that would add O and two CH2 groups. So the formula for 3-ethoxybenzamide would be C7 (Ph) + C2 (ethoxy) + O (from benzamide) + O (from ethoxy) → but wait, the benzamide already has one O in the CONH2 and another O in the ethoxy? Or wait, benzamide is PhCONH2: C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would add C2H5O. So the total would be C7 + C2 = C9, H7 + H5 (ethoxy) + H2 (from another group?), O: 1 (from benzamide) + 1 (ethoxy) = 2. So the formula would be C9H12NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So this option would have H12, but the problem states H11. So A is likely incorrect.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. So substituting phenyl group, structure is HCON(Ph-OCH2CH3). Let me count:

Phenyl (C6H5) → 6 C, 5 H.

OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) adds 2 C, 5 H (since OCH2CH3 is C2H5O).

Formamide part: HCON- → adds 1 C (the C from HCON) and 1 O.

So total C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide) = 9 C. H: 5 (Ph) +5 (ethoxy) + 1 (from formamide H) → 11 H. O: 2 (one from formamide, one from ethoxy). Plus N:1.

So the formula is C9H11NO2. That matches! So option B is a possible candidate.

IR data: 1720 cm-1 would be the formamide carbonyl. The two peaks around 3400 and 3325 cm-1 could be from the formamide's N-H stretch, but since formamide has only one N-H, that might not explain two bands. Wait, unless there's another N-H elsewhere, but option B has only formamide, which is HCON. So perhaps the two peaks are from another source, like an amine. But in option B, there's no amine. Hmm, that might be a problem.

Alternatively, maybe there's an NH in the formamide. Wait, formamide is HCONR2, but in this case, it's HCON(Ph-OCH2CH3), which is a primary amide. The N-H would show as a broad peak around 3300-3500. So why two peaks? Maybe the two peaks are from different environments, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are from an amine group elsewhere. Hmm, but option B doesn't have another amine group.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is (CH2)2COO-. The structure would be PhNH2COO(CH2)2CH3. Wait, but that would be 4-(aminophenyl)propanoate ester. Let me count the atoms.

Ph (C6H5) → 6C,5H.

NH2 → adds N and 2H.

COO- is (O)2.

(CH2)2CH3 → 3 C, 7 H.

So total:

C: 6 (Ph) + 3 (propionate) = 9 C.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +7 (propionate) → 14 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So this doesn't match. Wait, no. Wait, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-R. Let me correct:

Propionate: (CH2)2COO-R. R is ethyl in this case? No, wait, in option C, it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, which would be CH2CH2COO- attached to benzene with NH2 in para. So the structure is benzene with NH2 and COO(CH2)2CH3 in para. Wait, how many H's?

Benzene: 5 H.

NH2: 2 H.

O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3: the ester group.

The ester group: OCH2CH2CH3 is 3 C and 7 H.

So total H's: 5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +7 (ester) = 14 H. Plus any from the COO group? Wait, the COO is O, so no H. So H14. But the formula is H11. So that's a problem. So option C can't be correct because the H count is off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

The structure is:

Ph-NH2-COO-(CH2)2-CH3?

No, that's not correct. The propionate ester would be Ph-O-CO-(CH2)2-CH3? No, wait, propionate ester is R-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, the correct formula for 4-aminophenyl propionate is:

Ph-NH2 and the propionate is O-CO-(CH2)2-CH3.

So the formula would be:

Ph (C6H5) → 6C,5H.

NH2 → adds 1N, 2H.

O-CO-(CH2)2CH3 → adds 3C, 7H, 2O.

So total:

C:6 +3 =9.

H:5 +2 +7 =14.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So H is 14 vs 11. Doesn't match. So option C is out.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph (C6H5) →6C,5H.

NH2 →1N, 2H.

COOEt (C3H5O2) →3C,5H, 2O.

So total:

C:6+3=9.

H:5 +2 +5=12.

But the formula is C9H11NO2. So H is 12 vs 11. Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the COOEt group is COOCH2CH3. So the ethyl group is OCH2CH3.

So the formula would be:

Ph (6C,5H).

NH2 (1N,2H).

COOCH2CH3 → (2C,3H) in the ester group, but wait, the ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, the ester is O-CO-O connected to CH2CH3. Wait, no, the ester group is R-O-CO-R'. So for ethyl ester, it's CH3CH2-O-CO-PhNH2.

Wait, maybe I should count the atoms correctly.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O

Benzoate is PhCOO-. So ethyl benzoate would be PhCOOCH2CH3.

But in this case, the benzoate has an NH2 in the para position. So the structure is Ph-NH2-COOCH2CH3.

So, formula:

Ph → C6H5.

NH2 → C0H2N.

COOCH2CH3 → C3H5O2.

So total C:6 (Ph) + 3 (COOCH2CH3) =9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (COOCH2CH3) =12 H.

N:1.

O:2.

So formula is C9H12NO2. But the problem states C9H11NO2, so H is 12 vs 11. Thus, option D's formula is off by one H.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount.

Ph group: 6 C, 5 H.

NH2: 2 H.

COOCH2CH3: the COO group is O, and the ethyl is CH2CH3 → so the COOCH2CH3 has 3 C (from COO and CH2CH3), but wait, COO has two O and the ethyl has 2 C. So COOCH2CH3 is (COO) + (CH2CH3). So that contributes 3 C (the COO has one C, and ethyl has two C), 5 H (COO has no H, ethyl has 2+3=5?), wait.

Actually, the COOCH2CH3 group has:

- The carbonyl group: C=O → 1 C, no H.

- The ester oxygen: O.

- The ethyl group: CH2CH3 → 2 C, 5 H (since CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H).

So the COOCH2CH3 group contributes 3 C (if the COO is part of the benzoate), and 5 H.

So overall, the structure is:

Ph (6C,5H) - NH2 (0C,2H) - COOCH2CH3 (3C,5H)

So total C:6 +3 =9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (ester) =12 H.

So formula is C9H12NO2. But the problem is C9H11NO2. So either the structure is different, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group is not OCH2CH3 but another group that reduces the H count. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is not an ethyl ester but something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a double bond or a ring that reduces the H count. But in all the options, they seem to have substituents that would lead to higher H counts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula for option B. Let me check.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON-(4-OCH2CH3 phenyl).

So the formula would be:

Ph (6C,5H) → 6C,5H.

OCH2CH3 (2C,5H,1O).

HCON (1C,1O,1N).

So total C:6 +2 +1 =9.

H:5 +5 +1 (from HCON) →11 H.

O:1 (from OCH2CH3) +1 (from HCON) =2.

N:1.

So formula is C9H11NO2, which matches.

So option B fits the molecular formula.

But earlier, I was confused about the IR. The IR has two peaks around 3400 and 3325, which would suggest two N-H groups, but formamide has only one N-H. Hmm. Maybe the two peaks are due to different types of N-H, but formamide is a primary amide with a single N-H. So this is conflicting.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound has both an amide and an amine group. Let me think. Are any of the options like that?

Looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has an amino group (NH2) and an ester (no amide). So the IR would show N-H from the amine as broad peaks. Let me reconsider option D.

In option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The IR would have strong N-H stretching from the amine. So the 3420 and 3325 cm-1 could be from the NH2 group. The 1720 cm-1 would be the ester's carbonyl.

The 1H NMR:

- 1.20 ppm (t,3H) → ethyl CH3.

- 4.0 ppm (bs,2H) → perhaps the NH2 protons? Wait, but NH2 protons are usually broad, but they would appear as a broad peak, not as a singlet necessarily. Also, their integration would be 2H. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group. But wait, the chemical shift for NH2 in D would be around 1-5 ppm, depending on the environment. But 4.0 is a bit high.

In the 1H NMR, there's also a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). If the ethyl ester's OCH2 is at 4.1, but in the data, it's at 4.5, that's a mismatch. So perhaps option D isn't correct.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.5 ppm quartet is from another group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the quartet is from a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like CH2COO-. So in an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have a quartet.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap.

Option B: molecular formula matches, aromatic NMR fits, but IR has two N-H peaks which may not fit.

Option D: formula doesn't match because H count is off unless I made a mistake. But wait, in option D, the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is PhNHCOOEt. No, that's not correct. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is PhNH2COOEt.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as PhNH2COOEt.

Ph has 6C,5H.

NH2: adds 0C,2H.

COOEt: adds 3C (COO has one C, Et has two C).

So total C:6 +3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (COOEt) =12 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, so H is 12 vs 11. So option D can't be correct.

Hmm, that leaves option B as the only option with the correct formula. So despite the IR issue, perhaps option B is correct.

In option B, the IR peaks at 3420 and 3325 could be from the formamide's N-H and perhaps some other effect, or maybe it's an error in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are from different environments, but I'm not sure.

Looking again at the NMR data for option B.

Ph group with formamide and ethoxy in para.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches the data.

The ethoxy group: OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2, and OCH2 as quartet at 4.1. But the given quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is in another position, but no, option B says 4-ethoxyphenyl.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is attached to another group that shifts the NMR.

Wait, maybe the formamide's CH2? No, formamide is HCONR2.

Wait, perhaps the NMR data can be explained as follows:

The 1.20 ppm triplet is the ethoxy CH3.

The quartet at 4.5 is the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen. But in that case, the OCH2 would be a quartet, so it should be around 4.1, but it's at 4.5. Maybe the deshielding from the carbonyl causes it to shift upfield or downfield. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is part of a different structure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the quartet at 4.5 is from a CH2 connected to the formamide's carbonyl. But formamide's structure is HCONR2, so the R is the phenyl group. So the ethoxy is attached to the phenyl, not to the formamide.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but considering the molecular formula, option B is the only one that fits. So perhaps the IR has two N-H peaks because of the formamide's N-H and something else, but I can't think of another N-H group in option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are from an amine, but option B doesn't have an amine; it's a formamide. So the two N-H peaks are only from formamide, which is a single N-H. That doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the two IR peaks are from a secondary amide. Let me think: secondary amides have two N-H groups, which would give two absorption bands. But in option B, it's a primary amide (formamide), which has only one N-H. So, unless the structure is a secondary amide, which none of the options suggest, this doesn't fit.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is PhNH2COOEt. Then, the IR would show the NH2 as a broad peak around 3400, and the ester carbonyl at 1720. But the H count is off, but maybe I miscalculated.

Another approach: the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) is probably an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) could be part of an acetyl group or another substituent. Wait, but which option includes an acetyl group? None of the options do.

Wait, option B: formamide's structure is HCONR2. The R is phenyl. So the formamide group is HCONPh. So the only substituents are the ethoxy and formamide on the benzene.

In that case, the only ethyl group is from the ethoxy. So the ethoxy's OCH2CH3 would give a triplet at 1.2 and a quartet at 4.1. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless the ethoxy is part of another group, like an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from another CH2 group. For example, perhaps the formamide is part of a larger structure with a CH2 group.

Wait, formamide is HCONR2. If R is a phenyl group, then there's no CH2 attached to the carbonyl. So that's not the case.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option B despite the discrepancies. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the options.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again for option D. If the ethyl ester's OCH2 is at 4.1, but the data has it at 4.5, that's a problem. But perhaps there's another group causing a shift. Maybe the NH2 is causing some deshielding, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is from the amine. In option D, the amine is NH2. Aromatic amines can have NH2 protons as broad signals, but where? Usually around 2-5 ppm. The integration is 2H, which would fit an NH2 group. So the 4.0 ppm (bs,2H) could be the NH2. Then, the quartet at 4.5 would be from the ester's OCH2.

But in that case, the OCH2 of the ester would be at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual. But maybe due to the proximity to the amine group.

So for option D, the NMR would have:

1.20 (t,3H) → ethyl CH3.

4.0 (bs,2H) → NH2.

4.5 (q,2H) → OCH2.

But wait, the OCH2 in the ester is usually around 4.1, so 4.5 is a bit high. Maybe it's not the OCH2. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group.

Alternatively, the quartet at 4.5 could be the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl, but in an ester, the carbonyl is adjacent to the O, not a CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling in the NMR. The quartet at 4.5 (integration 2H) could be coupled with the ethyl's CH3, giving a quartet of 2H. So that would fit the ethoxy group's OCH2, which is next to the CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the CH3), which is at 1.2. So the OCH2 would be at 4.1, but the data shows it at 4.5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not an ethoxy group but another group. Like an ethyl ester's OCH2. So, in option D, the OCH2 would be at 4.1, but the data shows it at 4.5. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is from a different group. For example, maybe a CH2 connected to a carbonyl. Like in a structure where the benzamide has a CH2 group attached to the carbonyl. But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an OCH2 that's adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, causing a downfield shift. For example, if it's attached to an amide, the OCH2 would be more downfield.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct despite the H count discrepancy. Or maybe I made a mistake in the H count.

Wait, going back to option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure is Ph-NH2-COOCH2CH3.

So the H count:

Ph →5H.

NH2 →2H.

COOCH2CH3: the ester group has 5 H (CH2CH3). So total H:5+2+5=12. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 vs 11, which is a problem. So unless the structure is different.

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-NH-COOCH2CH3, with an NH instead of NH2. That would reduce the H count by one. But the option says 4-aminobenzoate, which is NH2.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but considering all the options, option B seems to fit the molecular formula and the aromatic NMR data, even though the IR might not perfectly align. Alternatively, perhaps the two N-H peaks in IR are due to different environments, but I can't think of another reason.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the N-H peaks is from the formamide and the other is from a hydroxyl group, but the molecular formula doesn't have an OH. So that can't be.

Alternatively, the two peaks could be from an amine and an amide, but in option B, it's only an amide.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused, but I think option B is the best fit based on the molecular formula and NMR data, despite the IR seeming a bit off.


To identify the compound C9H11NO2, the spectroscopic data and the options were analyzed as follows:

### Molecular Formula and IR Data
The molecular formula C9H11NO2 suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide, and possibly an amino or ethoxy group. The IR data shows:
- Medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹**, likely N-H stretches.
- A strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

### NMR Data
The 1H NMR data is as follows:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a CH3 group in an ethyl group.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, possibly from NH2 protons or a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, likely from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group in the meta position.
- The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets, as the meta substitution would result in a different splitting pattern.
- The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** matches, but the NMR data does not fit the expected splitting for meta-substituted aromatic protons.
- **Eliminated** due to mismatch with NMR data.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCON-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.
- The aromatic protons would produce two doublets due to the para-substitution, matching the NMR data.
- The ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would produce a triplet at **1.20 ppm** (CH3) and a quartet at **4.1 ppm** (OCH2). However, the quartet in the data is at **4.5 ppm**, which is slightly shifted but could be due to deshielding effects.
- The IR peaks at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹** could correspond to the N-H stretch of the formamide, and the strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** matches the carbonyl stretch of the formamide.
- The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** matches.
- **Fits the molecular formula and NMR data, though the IR interpretation is slightly uncertain.**

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: Propionate (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group in the para position.
- The aromatic protons would produce two doublets, matching the NMR data.
- However, the molecular formula **C9H11NO2** does not match, as the structure would have **C10H13NO2**.
- **Eliminated due to mismatch with molecular formula.**

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: Ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid.
- The aromatic protons would produce two doublets, matching the NMR data.
- The ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would produce a triplet at **1.20 ppm** (CH3) and a quartet at **4.1 ppm** (OCH2). However, the quartet in the data is at **4.5 ppm**, which is slightly shifted.
- The IR peaks at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹** could correspond to the N-H stretches of the amine, and the strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** matches the carbonyl stretch of the ester.
- The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** matches, but the H count in the structure suggests **C9H12NO2**, which is inconsistent with the given formula.
- **Eliminated due to mismatch with molecular formula.**

### Conclusion
Option B, **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, is the best fit based on the molecular formula, NMR data, and IR data. While there is some uncertainty regarding the IR peaks, the other options either fail to match the molecular formula or the NMR data.

**Answer: B**
