Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Wait, but what's the actual process here?

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. Oh right, I think this is about the energy levels in electrons. When electrons get excited by absorbing light, they jump to a higher energy state, and then when they drop back down, they emit the energy as light. So the energy of the emitted light relates to the energy gap between those states.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. Oh right, the compound absorbs the complementary color to the one it emits. Because when it absorbs a certain wavelength, it uses that energy to get electrons excited, then emits the other. So the absorbed light's energy is higher than the emitted?

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Because the energy of the absorbed photon has to be higher than the energy gap. Or wait, the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between the two states. So maybe the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to that energy gap, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, when a molecule absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light matches the energy gap between two molecular orbitals. So the absorbed light's energy equals the energy difference. Then, the molecule might emit the same energy? Or maybe higher or lower? Wait, no, in fluorescence or phosphorescence, the emitted light is usually lower in energy than the absorbed, because some energy is lost
