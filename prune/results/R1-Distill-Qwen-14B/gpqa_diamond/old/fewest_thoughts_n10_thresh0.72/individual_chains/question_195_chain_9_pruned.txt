Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with Earth's radius, orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet's orbital period is 3 days, and the transit impact parameter is 0.2. Now, they're asking about a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's, and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, wait. So both planets are in the same system, same star, same orbital plane. So when Planet A transits, it passes in front of the star from our point of view. When Planet B transits, same thing. But the question is about Planet B's maximum period so that it can also have both transit and occultation events.

Wait, what's an occultation event? Oh right, that's when the planet passes behind the star from our view, so the planet is hidden by the star's glare. So for that to happen, the planet must be close enough in orbital distance that our line of sight allows it to both pass in front and behind the star. But how does that relate to orbital periods?

I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. But both planets are in the same orbital plane, which is already edge-on because Planet A is transiting. So that condition is satisfied for Planet B as well.

Now, the key here is that both planets must transit and occult. So for Planet B, its orbit must be such that it can both pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star. How does the orbital period affect this?

Wait, another thought: The transit and occultation events happen when the planet is in the same line of sight as the star. So for a planet to both transit and occult, it must have an orbital period such that it's sometimes in front and sometimes behind the star relative to us. But how does the orbital period relate to the orbital radius?

Oh, right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. It relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis (in this case, the radius since the orbit is circular). The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. But since the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star, we can approximate M+m ≈ M. So P² is proportional to a³.

So the period depends on the radius of the orbit. Longer radius means longer period.

Wait, but why does the period affect whether it can transit and occult? Maybe because if Planet B's orbital period is too long, it's not moving quickly enough relative to the star, so maybe it can't go behind and then come back
