Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they do so through the strong force usually, but sometimes via other forces. But the question is about the mean decay distance for this particular meson X.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. We need to find the mean decay distance from the options provided. 

Wait, mean decay distance... right, that's the average distance the meson travels before decaying. I think this has to do with its lifetime and the speed at which it's moving. Oh, right, the formula for mean decay length is (c * τ) * βγ, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and βγ is the Lorentz factor. 

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh yes, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. 

Wait, but units are tricky here. Let me make sure I handle the units correctly. Let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using Γ. Γ is given in MeV, but Planck's constant ħ is in units involving GeV·s, or something like that. Let me recall: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. So that's (6.5
