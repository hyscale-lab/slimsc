Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I know that C3H6 could be propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But wait, propene is more common in these kinds of reaction sequences. So I'll assume A is propene.

Then, compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes typically adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3). Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. The reaction of vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane) with alcoholic KOH usually leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. When KOH is present, it likely deprotonates and removes one Br, leading to E2 elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, propene was the starting material. So the dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane. When it reacts with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate HBr twice, forming propene again? Or maybe another alkene? Wait, wait, perhaps it's more about the positions. The dihalide is CH2BrCH2CH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, when Br2 adds to a double bond, it adds across the double bond in a dibromide. So the structure would be CH2BrCHBrCH3. No, wait, wait, propene is CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, each Br adds to adjacent carbons. So it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when KOH (alcoholic) is added, that's an E2 elimination. The dihalide would lose two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. But where?

The dihalide is on C1 and C2. So eliminating H from C1 and C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, which would be propene again. Wait, but if the starting material was propene, and after bromination and elimination, you're back to propene. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is 1-bromo-2-bromopropane, which upon elimination gives 1-propene again. So compound C would be propene.

Wait, but
