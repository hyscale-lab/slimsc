Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Let's see what the potential looks like.

The potential V(r, θ) is given as (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down. I remember that in polar coordinates, r is the radius and θ is the angle. So this potential depends on both r and θ.

I think I should first try to express this potential in a way that might resemble known potentials. Let me consider each term separately. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. Because in one dimension, a harmonic oscillator has V(x) = 1/2 m ω² x², but here it's kr², so maybe the effective mass or spring constant is different. Wait, but since it's in 2D, the overall potential would be like a 2D harmonic oscillator. But then there's the second term, which complicates things.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity. I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Simplifying that: (3/4)kr² (1 + cos 2θ). So the entire potential becomes (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² (1 + cos 2θ).

Let me combine the terms. The 1/2 kr² and the 3/4 kr² *1 would add up. 1/2 is 2/4, plus 3/4 is 5/4 kr². So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos(2θ). Hmm, that's better.

Wait, but another approach: Maybe I can rewrite the entire potential as a sum of terms that resemble harmonic oscillators or something separable. Alternatively, perhaps using polar coordinates, I can find a way to separate the equation of motion into radial and angular parts.

Wait, I recall that when the potential is separable into r and θ parts, the problem can be solved by finding the energy eigenvalues for each part separately. So maybe I can split V(r,θ) into functions that depend only on r and only on θ.

Looking again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, let me factor out kr²: V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Let me see if I can express this as a sum of terms involving cosθ or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of Cartesian coordinates because sometimes polar coordinates can complicate angular terms. Let me try converting to x and y. Remember that in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ =
