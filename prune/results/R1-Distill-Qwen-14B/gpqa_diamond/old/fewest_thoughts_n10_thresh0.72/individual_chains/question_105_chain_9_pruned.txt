Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, I guess? Or maybe 1000 K difference? The question says temperature difference of 1000 K, but it's not clear if it's 6000-1000=5000 K for spots or 6000+1000=7000 K. Hmm, probably the spots are cooler because they are dark. So spots are at 5000 K.

But the main point is about photometric observations. The star's brightness varies because of these spots as it rotates, so the hemisphere with spots comes into and out of view. This is compared to an exoplanet transit, which also causes a dip in brightness when the planet passes in front of the star.

The question is asking: to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve, what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star? So, what exoplanet radius Rpl would give the same dip as the spot-induced variation?

Wait, but the star isn't covered by spots in the alternative scenario. So if the star was spot-free, what planet radius would cause the same brightness variation.

Let me think. The amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area blocked and the temperature contrast.

When a planet transits a star, the light dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But for the star with spots, the variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, more spots are visible, causing a dip in brightness because the spots are cooler and emit less light.

The amplitude of the dip would be the difference in brightness when the spots are on the near side versus when they're not. So we need to calculate how much the total brightness changes due to the spots.

First, let's model this. The area of the star is 4π Rstar². But only one hemisphere has spots. The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) ). Wait, wait, each hemisphere is 2π R², right? So the total area of the spotted hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4π R².

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4π R² * σ Teff^4. But when the spots are facing us, part of the star's surface emits less light.

The spots have a temperature of Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K. So each spot emits σ T_spot^4 per unit area.

The change in brightness when the spots are visible is the difference between the original flux and the flux with spots.

Original flux is the entire star's emission: F0 = (Teff^4) * σ / (4π D²) ) * 4π R² / (4π D²) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of relative flux.

Wait, total flux from the star is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When spots are visible, the flux is L' = L - (area of spots) * σ (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / something? Hmm, maybe it's better to compute the fractional change.

Fraction of the star covered by spots when viewed: for a hemisphere, the fraction is (area of spots) / (area of hemisphere) ) = 0.2. But wait, the question says the filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area covered on the hemisphere
