Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. The options are given as A and B, and I have to choose the correct pair.

First, let's look at reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this probably involves some kind of elimination or maybe an addition reaction. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an ester with a double bond, so maybe this is a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, noâ€”wait, the numbering. Let me get the correct structure. So, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the ketone at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group, and C6 has a methyl group. Also, C2 and C6 each have another methyl? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. Oh, so C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. So positions 2 and 6 each have a methyl and ethyl? No, wait. 2-ethyl means at position 2, there's an ethyl substituent. 2,6-dimethyl means at positions 2 and 6, each has a methyl group. Wait, that's more likely. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1. C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C6 has a methyl group. So it's a substituted cyclohexanone.

Now, the reaction is with ethyl acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. When a ketone reacts with such
