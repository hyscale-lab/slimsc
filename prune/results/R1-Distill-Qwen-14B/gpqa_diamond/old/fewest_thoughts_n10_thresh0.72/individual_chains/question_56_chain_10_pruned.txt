Hmm, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Let's try to think through this step by step.

Okay, the question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options are A, B, C, D with different transition routes and probabilities.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, right? Because dipole transitions involve the change in the angular momentum via the photon's angular momentum.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So going from n=3 to n=1 in two steps. Each step must be a dipole transition, so each step must follow the selection rules.

Wait, wait, the problem says it's via two dipole transitions. So the process is |3,0,0> → some intermediate state → |1,0,0>.

So the first transition is from n=3 to some lower state. Let's think about possible l and m values for the intermediate state.

Since Δl must be ±1, and initial l is 0 (s orbital). So after the first transition, l can only become 1 (p orbital) because 0 +1 =1, and 0-1 is invalid since l can't be negative. So the first intermediate must have l=1.

Wait, but dipole transitions require that the photon carries away or adds angular momentum. So for the first transition, from l=0 to l=1? Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the dipole transition, the photon can carry away angular momentum, so the atom's orbital angular momentum can change by ±1. So from l=0 to l=1 (since l can't be negative, so +1 is the only option). So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to |n',1,m'>. Then from there to |1,0,0>.

Now, let's think of the possible n's. The initial n is 3. The final is 1. So the transition from 3 to something, then to 1. What's possible? Let's think about the possible n's between 3 and 1. It's 2, probably. So the intermediate state is likely n=2, l=1, m something.

So for the first transition, n goes from 3 to 2 (since 3 to 1 would require Δn=2, which is not allowed in a single dipole transition. Each transition must change n by ±1 or something? Wait, no, the n doesn't have a strict selection rule in dipole transitions except that it must change by Δn ≠ 0. Wait, no, the selection rule for n is that the photon's energy corresponds to the transition, but n can change by any integer, but the allowed transitions are based on the energy difference. Wait, maybe I'm confusing. No, wait, the dipole selection rules for hydrogen are:

Δl = ±1 (as I said
