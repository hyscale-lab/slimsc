Okay, so I'm trying to figure this out. Let's start by understanding the scenario. Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM). He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, which should mean there's almost no gas molecules in there. He does this because gas molecules can mess up the electron microscopy by scattering the electrons.

But despite the vacuum, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. So Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? Factors like pressure, temperature, and volume affect that. 

Now, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices something different. The mean free path changes—it's now λ2, not λ1. The temperature is the same as before, so that's not changing. So why would the mean free path change?

Hmm. The mean free path in a gas is given by the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. Wait, but wait, another formula I remember is λ = (1/√(n * π * d²)), where n is the number density. Because n is inversely proportional to pressure (since PV = nRT, so n = P/(kT)), so higher pressure means lower λ. But in our case, the pressure is already super low.

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, does that affect the gas? Oh, right! The electron beam is a source of energy. High-energy electrons can cause various effects. One thing is that the beam might ionize the gas molecules, or cause them to be excited. Maybe the gas molecules start moving faster because they're being hit by electrons, which increases the temperature locally. But the problem states that the sample compartment temperature remained the same, so perhaps the overall temperature isn't changing.

Alternatively, maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to be scattered more. Or perhaps the gas is being pumped out more efficiently when the electrons are on, but I don't think that's the case because the pumps were already running, and the pressure was already at ultra-high vacuum.

Wait, another thought. The mean free path is determined by the rate of collisions between gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, maybe the electrons are causing collisions between the gas molecules and the electrons. So the gas molecules are colliding with the electrons, which are moving at high speeds.

So the mean free path in the original calculation (λ1) was based on gas molecule-to-gas molecule collisions. But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can also collide with the electrons. So the effective mean free path would change because now there's another type of collision—gas molecules hitting electrons from the beam.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path calculation is from the gas molecules' perspective. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can also interact with the electrons. So the effective cross-section for collisions would now include both gas-gas and gas-electron interactions.

But wait, the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules. Or are they? The electrons in the beam are accelerated to a high voltage, so 1000 kV is 1,000,000 eV. The speed of the electrons can be calculated, but I think they're moving relativistically. So much faster than the gas molecules, which are probably at room temperature or whatever the sample temp is.

So, the electrons are moving fast, so when a gas molecule is moving slowly, the relative speed between the electron and the gas molecule is high. So the collision cross-section would be higher. Or wait, the effective area for a collision depends on the relative speed and the target's size. Hmm, maybe the mean free path would decrease because the gas molecules are now colliding more frequently with the electrons, which are a different kind of "target".

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The mean free path λ is the
