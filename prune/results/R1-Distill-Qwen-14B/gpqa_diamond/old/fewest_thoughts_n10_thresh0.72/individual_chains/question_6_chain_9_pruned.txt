Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the energy spectrum for a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I remember that in two dimensions, polar coordinates are often used, so r is the radial distance and θ is the angle. 

Wait, I think I've heard about potentials that can be separated into radial and angular parts. Maybe this is a case where the potential can be expressed as a sum of functions each depending on only r or only θ. Let me see: the potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, that's (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Or wait, wait, maybe factor out r²?

So, V(r,θ) = [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ] (k r²). Oh, that's interesting. I think this kind of potential might be expressible in terms of angular components and radial components.

Wait, the term 3 cos²θ can be rewritten using the double-angle identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, we have:

3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ.

So the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ]? Wait, wait, no, I think I messed up the substitution. Let me go back.

Wait, the original expansion was V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So, factor out k r²/2:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Now, using cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, substitute:

V = (k r²/2)[1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Simplify inside the brackets:
