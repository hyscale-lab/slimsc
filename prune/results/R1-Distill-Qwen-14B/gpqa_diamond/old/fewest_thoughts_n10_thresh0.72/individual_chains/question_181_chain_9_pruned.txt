Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think it through. So the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core. I remember that the pp chain is one of the main ways the Sun produces energy, right? And there are different branches in this chain.

Wait, so the pp-III branch stopping. I think the pp chain has several branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which produces protons and eventually helium. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which I think are less significant but still contribute to the energy production. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves reactions that release higher-energy neutrinos, like the ones from the decay of 15O, which I think are the ones that produce the high-energy neutrinos we detect on Earth.

So the question says that the pp-III branch stops. That probably affects the production of certain neutrinos. So, neutrino flux from the Sun is normally a mix from different sources. The pp-I branch produces most of the neutrinos, I believe, with lower energies. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around 700-800 keV or higher.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So if pp-III stops, what happens to these two bands?

So, the pp-III branch probably produces neutrinos in the higher energy ranges. Let me think, the main neutrinos are the ones from the 8B neutrinos, which are from the pp-III branch. Those have energies around a few MeV, but some might be in the hundreds of keV too. So, the pp-III branch contributes to higher-energy neutrinos.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of high-energy neutrinos would drop. So the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) comes mainly from the pp-III branch. If that's gone, then band 2's flux would decrease a lot. But band 1, 700-800 keV, maybe that's where the pp-I branch neutrinos are. Or perhaps it's the lower-energy neutrinos from other sources like the pep branch?

Wait,
