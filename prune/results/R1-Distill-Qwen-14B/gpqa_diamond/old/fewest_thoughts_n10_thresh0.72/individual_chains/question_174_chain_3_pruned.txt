Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember that when a nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and they have kinetic energy because of the mass defect. But wait, the question is about the difference between the correct relativistic calculation and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Interesting.

Let me read the problem again. The initial nucleus has a rest mass M with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. So, E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV. Then, it fissions into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. So, let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2. Since m1 is twice m2, m1 = 2 m2.

The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. But wait, because M is the initial rest mass, which is 300 GeV/c², right? So substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M.

Wait, but the initial mass was M, and the sum of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So the mass defect is 1% of M. That's the mass that's converted into kinetic energy, right? But wait, not exactly, because kinetic energy comes from the binding energy, which is the mass defect. So the total mass after fission is less than before, so that's where the energy comes from.

So the mass defect Δm is M - (m1 + m2) = M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. So Δm = 0.01 M.

Now, the total energy released should be Δm c². But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is just M c². After fission, the two fragments will have rest mass energy (m1 c² + m2 c²) plus their kinetic energies. So the energy conservation equation would be:

M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2) 

So, (K1 + K2) = (M - (m1 + m2)) c² = 0.01 M c².

Which is 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. But wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So let's find T1.

Since the two fragments are moving apart, and the system was initially at rest, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, the momenta p1 and p2 should satisfy p1 = -p2. But since the two masses are different, their velocities will adjust so that this holds.

In the center-of-momentum frame (which is the initial rest frame), the total momentum is zero, so each fragment's momentum must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But since they're moving in opposite directions, their kinetic energies will depend on their masses and velocities.

But wait, for non-relativistic speeds, we can use the classical approximation. But the question is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical T1.

So I need to calculate T1 using both approaches and find the difference.

Wait, but first, perhaps I should find the velocities of each fragment in the rest frame.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But relativistically, it's (γ - 1) m c².

But let's proceed step by step.

First, let's find the velocities and kinetic energies in both cases.

But perhaps a smarter approach is to find the ratio of kinetic energies in the non-relativistic case and the relativistic case, given the mass ratio.

Alternatively, since the problem gives a specific scenario, maybe I can compute the exact kinetic energies.

Wait, but the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Let's see: in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 v2². But since momentum must be conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2 (because the total momentum is zero, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So the magnitudes are equal: m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1. Since m1 is 2 m2, so v2 = 2 v1.

Now, the kinetic energies would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 (2 v1)² = (1/2) m2 * 4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

Now, the sum is (1/2 m1 v1²) + 2 m2 v1².

But m1 is 2 m2, so substituting:

(1/2)(2 m2) v1² + 2 m2 v1² = (m2 v1²) + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1².

The total kinetic energy in non-relativistic case is 3 Ge
