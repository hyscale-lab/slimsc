Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and figuring out which one is more massive. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in binary systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method is used to detect these systems because as the stars move towards or away from us, their velocities change periodically.

The question gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Oh, right, the period here is the orbital period of the binary system, the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other once.

Then, there are radial velocity (RV) amplitudes given. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. Oh, wait, RV amplitude refers to how fast each star is moving towards or away from us. The bigger the amplitude, the more massive the companion? Or is it the other way around?

I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift. The more massive a star is, the smaller its orbit around the center of mass, right? So the more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less. Because the less massive star has to move more to balance the system.

So, the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. So if one star has a higher velocity amplitude, it must be less massive. Because the more massive star contributes less to the velocity.

Wait, the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses of the stars. Oh right! The mass function equation is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars. But I'm not sure if inclination is a factor here. If the orbits are edge-on, sin i is 1, which I think is the case for eclipsing binaries since we can see eclipses, so i is close to 90 degrees.

Wait, but the question is about the total mass of each system. So the sum M1 + M2 for each system. So I need to find the ratio of the total masses of system_1 to system_2.

But how do I get the mass from the velocity amplitudes?

I think the system's velocity amplitudes are related to the masses. Because the more massive the star, the lower its velocity. So each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass.

Let me think: Let's denote for system_1, star A has velocity amplitude K1 = 10 km/s, star B has K2 =5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 2. But since velocity is inversely proportional to mass, mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, because their momenta have to balance each other (center of mass is stationary). So M1/M2 = K2/K1. So in system_1, M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5, so M1 = 0.5 M2. Therefore, the mass ratio q is 0.5.

So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2. Let's express M1 in terms of M2. M1 = 0.5 M2, so total mass is M2*(0.5 +1) =1.5 M2.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify:

M1 * K1 = M2 * K2,

so M1 = (M2 * K2) / K1.

So, for system_1:

M1 = (M2 *5)/10 = M2*(0.5). So M1 is half the mass of M2.

Therefore, total mass for system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5
