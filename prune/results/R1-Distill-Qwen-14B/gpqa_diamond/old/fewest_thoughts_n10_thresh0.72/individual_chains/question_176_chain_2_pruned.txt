Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but column matrices in quantum mechanics usually represent vectors, right? So I think this is the state vector of the system. But wait, I should check if it's normalized. To do that, I need to calculate the magnitude squared of each component and sum them.

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. Let me compute the sum of squares: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first? Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors. Hmm, but maybe the problem doesn't require considering normalization since the probabilities might take care of it. Or maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed as given.

Next, the operators P and Q are given as square matrices. P's matrix has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Q's matrix is diagonal: [1, 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0,-1]. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no. Wait, it's the other way around: first measure P, then Q. So the measurement of P will collapse the state, and then measure Q on the new state.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is measure P first, then Q.

But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q. So the sequence is first measure P, get 0, then measure Q and get -1.

But wait, because when you measure P
