Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, let me sketch out the target molecule. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring. The substituents are ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Wait, wait. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering the benzene ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, substituents are at 1, 2, 3â€”so they are adjacent in a meta arrangement? No, wait, 1,2,3 are adjacent but in a way that each is next to the other. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with those groups.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the directing effects of each substituent. Because when you introduce substituents on benzene, their directing (ortho/para or meta) depends on their type. So, the order in which substituents are introduced matters because each step's reaction is influenced by the existing substituents.

Benzene is the starting material. So, the first substitution will determine where the next groups go. Let's think about each substituent's effect.

The substituents in the target molecule are ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl, and nitro (NO2). Let's categorize them:

- Ethoxy (OEt): This is an activating group, ortho/para-directing. Since it's an ether, it donates electrons through resonance, activating the ring.
- tert-Butyl: This is a bulky, activating group. Alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing.
- Nitro (NO2): This is a deactivating, meta-directing
