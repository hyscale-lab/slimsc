Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, particularly how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I'll need to think this through.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of parallax (in arcseconds). So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If it's 0.5 arcseconds, it's 2 parsecs away. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So their number depends on the volume of space they occupy. But wait, how does that translate into parallax? Let's think about the volume in terms of distances.

In three dimensions, volume increases with the cube of the radius. So the number of stars in a shell between distance r and r + dr would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So for a uniform distribution, the number of stars dN would be proportional to 4πr² dr times the number density n (stars per unit volume). So dN = n * 4π r² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/r. So r is 1/plx. Let's make a substitution: r = 1/plx → dr = -1/(plx²) dplx. Hmm, I have to be careful with the substitution, especially the limits and the differential.

Wait, let me see. Since r = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But when plx increases, r decreases. So the limits would flip, but perhaps when integrating over plx, the negative sign will be accounted for automatically.

But in this problem, we're looking for the number per unit range of plx. Let's think about how the number of stars per unit plx interval (dplx) varies. So, let's express dN in terms of plx.

From dN = n * 4π r² dr, substituting r = 1/plx, so r² = 1/plx². And dr is (1/(plx²)) d
