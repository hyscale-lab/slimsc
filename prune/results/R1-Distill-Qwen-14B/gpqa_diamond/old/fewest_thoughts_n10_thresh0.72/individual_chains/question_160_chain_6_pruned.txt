Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction. Hmm, let's see. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are of the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining on it, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with diffraction, the pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. But for an infinitely large N, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. Oh, wait, but wait—no, wait, the polygon's apothems are all the same. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if N is very large, and all apothems are same, that's a regular polygon, which in the limit becomes a circle. So this might be similar to a circular aperture.

But wait, the question is about the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has the central maximum, then the first minimum at a certain angle. But I think when the aperture is a circle, the first minimum is at a specific angle given by some formula.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says when N is infinitely large, the shape is a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be the single-slit diffraction pattern, which is different from a circular aperture. Wait, no, wait—wait, no, confusion here. No, wait, for a single slit, the pattern is a series of bright and dark fringes. For a circular aperture, it's the Airy disk with rings.

Wait, but in this problem, the light is coming along the z-axis. The aperture is in a plane, say the x-y plane. So the setup is a 2D aperture. Oh, but if N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be that of a circular aperture. Hmm, but in that case, the far-field diffraction is described by the Bessel functions. The minima of the intensity occur when the Bessel function J1 is zero, but wait, for the single-slit, it's a sinc function, but for a circular aperture, it's an Airy pattern where the first minimum is at a certain angle.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's think about the general case for an aperture with a certain shape
