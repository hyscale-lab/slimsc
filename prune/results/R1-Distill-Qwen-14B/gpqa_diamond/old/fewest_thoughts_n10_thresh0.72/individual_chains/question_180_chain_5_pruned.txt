Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So I remember that the potential energy in an electrostatic system can be calculated based on the configuration of the charges. Since we're dealing with point charges, the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law, which is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but in this case, we have multiple charges. So I think the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But wait, is there a formula for the potential energy of a system of multiple charges?

Oh right, for a system of point charges, the total electric potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each unique pair of charges. So for n charges, you have n choose 2 pairs, which is n(n-1)/2 pairs.

But wait, in this problem, one charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 others are all at the same distance from it.

Let me think. The system has two parts: the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

So, first, I should compute the potential energy between the fixed charge (Q) and each of the 12 moving charges.

Wait, each has a charge of 2e. So the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is also 2e. So the potential energy between each pair would be (k * (2e)*(2e))/r. Since r is 2 meters, and each of the 12 charges is at that distance from Q.

So for each of the 12 charges, the
