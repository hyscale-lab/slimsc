Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I remember that annihilation involves a particle and its antiparticle. The process given is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two pairs of some particles A+ and A−. 

The question says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe that implies that the initial kinetic energy is low, but I'm not entirely sure. Also, they give me m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, so the particles A are the products. So the system starts with a proton and an antiproton. Protons have mass m_p, and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the total rest mass is 2 m_p c². But wait, in the annihilation, energy is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the products.

Wait, wait. But the problem says that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to their rest mass energy? Or perhaps it's non-negligible but low. Hmm, not sure yet.

I think I should consider conservation of energy and momentum. Because in any reaction, both energy and momentum must be conserved.

But wait, the system of the proton and antiproton. Let's model it as a proton at rest and the antiproton moving, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is small, and the proton is at rest. But wait, if the proton is at rest, then the total initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. Then, for the products, the total momentum must equal that.

So, the initial momentum is just p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p is low, so gamma_p ≈ 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

Wait, but in the initial state, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some velocity. So the initial momentum is all from the antiproton.

Now, the products are four particles: two A+ and two A−. But wait, the problem says the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So four particles in total, each A has mass m_A. 

Hmm, but if the products are two A+ and two A−, maybe they are moving in pairs. Wait, but if the initial momentum is non-zero, the products must carry away momentum. But if it's symmetric, perhaps the A+ and A− are moving in opposite directions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps they form two pairs, each moving in opposite directions, but I might need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the products are moving in such a way that the total momentum is conserved. But considering that the initial momentum is p_initial, the final momentum must be the same.

But perhaps this is a problem where you can apply the concept of conservation of energy and momentum, but it's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify by assuming that all the products are moving with the same speed, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in opposite directions, leading to cancellation of some momentum.

Wait, the problem asks for the velocity of particle A. So each A has the same velocity? Or maybe each A has the same speed, but moving in different directions. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the system is symmetric, so the two A+ and two A− are moving in certain directions, but maybe their velocities are such that the total momentum is equal to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps all four particles are moving with the same speed, but in opposite directions, leading to some cancellation. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of 4-momentum.

Wait, the initial 4-momentum is the sum of the proton and antiproton. Since the proton is at rest, its 4-momentum is (m_p c, 0). The antiproton is moving, but slowly, so gamma is approximately 1. So its 4-momentum is (gamma m_p c, gamma m_p v_p c). But since v_p is small, gamma is about 1, so approximately (m_p c, m_p v_p c).

So the total initial 4-momentum is (m_p c + m_p c, m_p v_p c) = (2 m_p c, m_p v_p c).

Wait, but actually, the proton is at rest, so its 4-momentum is (m_p c, 0). The antiproton is moving with velocity v_p, so its 4-momentum is (gamma m_p c, gamma m_p v_p c).

So the total initial 4-momentum is (m_p c + gamma m_p c, gamma m_p v_p c).

But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then v_p is small, so gamma is approximately 1. So total energy is (m_p + m_p) c² = 2 m_p c², and momentum is m_p v_p c.

Now, the products are four particles: 2 A+ and 2 A-. Let's assume each A has mass m_A, and they are all moving in the same direction, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in a way that their momentum vectors sum up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed, but moving in opposite directions. But with four particles, it's a bit tricky.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem simplifies because the annihilation produces two A+ and two A−. Maybe the total momentum of the products is the same as the initial momentum. Let's think about that.

The initial momentum is all from the antiproton, so it's p_initial = gamma m_p v_p c. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is about 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p
