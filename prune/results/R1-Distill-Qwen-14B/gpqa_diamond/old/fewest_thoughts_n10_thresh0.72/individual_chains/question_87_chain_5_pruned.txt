Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring with 6 members, meaning it's a substituted benzene. The total carbon atoms are 8. Wait, benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. Oh, but wait, substituents can be more complicated. Let me think.

Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the benzene ring. Each substituent could contribute some carbons. So, the benzene (6 carbons) plus two substituents adding 2 carbons in total. So each substituent adds one carbon each, or maybe one substituent adds two and the other none. No, because di-substituted would have two substituents. So, the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So, possible substituents could be two methyl groups (each -CH3, so 3 carbons each, but that would make 6 + 6 = 12, which is more than 8. So that can't be right.

Wait
