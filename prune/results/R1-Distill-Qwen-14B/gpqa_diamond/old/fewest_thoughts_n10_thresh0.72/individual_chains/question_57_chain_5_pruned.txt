Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

Alright, the problem states that the measured phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ =13°. And we’re supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction.

Wait, the scattering amplitude is usually denoted as f(θ, k), where k is the wave number. The expression for f involves the sum over all angular momentum l of the phase shifts. Oh right! The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is something like Im f(θ=0) = (2m/(ħ²))^(1/2) * sum over l of ( (2l + 1) sin δ_l ). Or maybe I have the formula slightly off. Let me recall.

I think the general formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum from l=0 to infinity [ (2l + 1) (sin δ_l) P_l(cos θ) ] / ( (k a_0)^(2l +1) ) ), where a_0 is the scattering length? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I remember that for the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion, the expression involves the Legendre polynomials multiplied by terms involving the phase shifts δ_l.

But since the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. At θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the scattering amplitude at θ=0 simplifies a lot, because all the P_l(1) terms are 1. So f(0) should be (1/k) * sum ( (2l + 1) sin δ_l ) * something. Wait,
