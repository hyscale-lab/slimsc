Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through the steps. 

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. It comes with some NMR data, and then it's treated with a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is, choosing from the given options.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR spectrum shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let's try to interpret this. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, since that's a typical region for them. Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet might suggest coupling with two adjacent protons, maybe from a CH2 group next to the aldehyde.

Looking at the other regions. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets each have 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is more downfield, which might suggest substitution on the benzene ring. For example, if the ring has substituents, like para-substituted groups, the protons would be at different shifts. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets could be from two ortho, meta, or para-substituted rings. Alternatively, maybe two different aromatic rings, each with their own substituents.

The 6.27 ppm broad singlet is 2H. Broad singlet could be something like an enol proton, or maybe some sort of amine, but wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about the structure.

Then the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) suggests maybe a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an OCH2 or something similar. Or maybe a CH2 attached to an electronegative atom. Since there's an 'O' in the formula, maybe an ether or ester group.

Putting this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, for formula, Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2 + 2C - H - X + N)/2. Let me see: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5.

That's five degrees of unsaturation. Which could be a ring and some double bonds. Let's think: each ring or double bond is one DoU. So, perhaps a benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (another one), and then a ring or another
