Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in this solution.

Wait a minute, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. So, when EDTA complexes with a metal ion like Ca²+, they form a complex ion. The formation constant, Kf, is given, right? Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). So I can rearrange this to find [Ca²+], which is the concentration of free calcium ions.

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, assuming it's completely formed, but that's not necessarily true. Oh, right, because some of the complex might dissociate. So I have to account for the dissociation.

So let me write down what I know. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's call [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Then, the dissociation equation is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

At equilibrium, some of the complex dissociates. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But wait, because the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) =5e10.

So substituting, Kf = (0.0
