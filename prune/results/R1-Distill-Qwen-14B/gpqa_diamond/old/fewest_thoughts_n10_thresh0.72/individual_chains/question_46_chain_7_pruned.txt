Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Specifically, I think Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, maybe involving Ruthenium, and it's used for ring-closing metathesis as well as cross metathesis.

So, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, what does racemic mean here? Oh right, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, does that matter in this reaction? Because Grubbs catalyst is achiral, so maybe the chirality doesn't affect the outcome. Or perhaps the structure is such that the starting material has a certain configuration, but after reaction, maybe some stereocenters are formed or broken.

Wait, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2. But 3-methyl would be CH2=CHCH(CH3) something. Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait wait, 1-ene is between C1 and C2. So pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let's see: pentane has five carbons. 1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure of 3-methylpent
