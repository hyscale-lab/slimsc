Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelength where they emit most brightly... Oh right, that's the peak wavelength, which relates to temperature via Wien's Law. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because Wien's Law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So same lambda_max means same temperature.

Wait, but wait. Do I need to consider anything else? Like, maybe one is moving towards us and the other away, so Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. Oh! The problem gives the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So, Doppler shift will affect the observed wavelength for Star_2.

Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed wavelength is the same for both. So, even though the intrinsic temperatures might be different, the Doppler shift makes their observed peak wavelengths the same.

Wait, no. Let me think again. So, without Doppler shift, if both have the same temperature, their peak wavelengths would be the same. But if one is moving towards us and the other away, that would shift the observed wavelengths. So if the observed peak wavelengths are the same, then their intrinsic temperatures must be adjusted by their velocities.

Wait, let's think about it. The observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_intrinsic * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/ (1 - v_r) ) ) or something like that? Or is it that the observed wavelength is stretched or compressed based on the velocity? Hmm, right, the Doppler effect for light. The formula is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but when velocities are much smaller than c, the speed of light, we can approximate it as lambda_observed ≈ lambda_rest (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity.

Wait, but wait, if the star is moving towards us, the wavelength is blueshifted, so lambda_observed is shorter than lambda_rest. If it's moving away, it's redshifted, longer wavelength. So in our case, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so lambda_1_observed = lambda_1_rest. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (since velocity is positive, but I'm not sure about the sign convention here). So Star_2's observed wavelength would be longer than its rest wavelength.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs. Since Star_1's observed is same as rest, and Star_2's observed is longer than rest, that means Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter to account for the same observed as Star_1. Which implies that Star_2 is intrinsically hotter than Star_1.

Wait, let me make this precise. Let me denote:

lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest (since v1=0)

lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c ), assuming non-relativistic speeds (since 700 km/s is much less than c ~3e5 km/s).

But wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the source is moving away, v_r is positive, so lambda_obs is longer than lambda_rest. So Star_2's lambda_obs is longer than its lambda_rest.

But the problem says lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs = same value.

So lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, no, because for Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. But wait, is it moving towards or away? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 is at rest, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. If the velocity is positive, it's moving away. So lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / c )

Wait, but 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. c is ~3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 is about 0.002333. So (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333. So lambda_2_obs ≈ lambda_2_rest * 1.002333.

But the observed wavelengths are the same. So lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * 1.002333.

So lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * 1.002333.

But we know that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. So lambda_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So:

lambda_1_rest = b / T1

lambda_2_rest = b / T2

So from above, (b/T1) = (b/T2) * 1.002333.

Wait, no. Wait, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * 1.002333.

But lambda_1_rest is (b / T1) and lambda_2_rest is (b / T2). So:

(b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So rearranged: T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that can't be right. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its rest frame, so its rest frame must have a shorter wavelength, meaning higher temperature. So T2 should be higher than T1.

Wait, let's plug in numbers.

From the equation: 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c ) * (1/T2)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, wait. Let me rederive this correctly.

The observed wavelength of Star_2 is lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away).

But since Star_1's observed is the same as Star_2's observed, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

But,

lambda_1_rest = (b / T1 )

lambda_2_rest = (b / T2 )

So,

(b / T1 ) = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Divide both sides by (b/(T2)):

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r2/c.

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So since v_r2 is 700 km/s, v_r2/c = 700e3 / (3e5e3) = 700/(3e5) = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.0023333.

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.0023333) ≈ T1 * 1.0023333.

So T2 is about 0.2333% higher than T1.

Wait, but that's a small difference. Wait, but if the temperature is higher for Star_2, then its luminosity would be higher. But wait, I'm getting a bit ahead. Let me proceed.

Now, I need to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

The formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So,

L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4

The ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

From the problem, R1 = 1.5 R2. So, R1/R2 = 1.5.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ) ≈ T1 * 1.0023333.

So, T2 / T1 = 1.0023333.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / (1.0023333)^4.

Let me compute (1.0023333)^4.

Let me compute 1.0023333^4.

Approximately, using the binomial expansion for small x:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x^2 + (n(n-1)(n-2)/6) x^3 + ... 

x is 0.0023333, so x^2 is about 5.44e-6, x^3 about 1.26e-8.

n=4.

So,

(1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4 * 0.0023333 + 6 * (0.0023333)^2 + 4*(0.0023333)^3 + (0.0023333)^4.

Compute each term:

4 * 0.0023333 = 0.0093332.

6 * (0.0023333)^2: 6*(5.44e-6) ≈ 3.264e-5.

4*(0.0023333)^3: 4*(1.26e-8) = 5.04e-8.

(0.0023333)^4: ~ 2.84e-11.

So adding all terms:

1 + 0.0093332 = 1.0093332

Plus 0.00003264 → 1.00936584

Plus 0.0000000504 → 1.0093658904

Plus 0.0000000000284 → negligible.

So approximately, 1.009366.

So 1/(1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1/(1.009366) ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, wait. Let's compute 1.009366^(-1):

1 / 1.009366 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) 

= (1.5)^2 * 0.9907.

1.5^2 is 2.25.

2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

So approximately 2.227, which is about 2.23, so the factor is approximately 2.23.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mess up the ratio.

Wait, L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, because T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1/T2)^4.

But earlier, I found that T2 = T1 * 1.002333, so T1/T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Wait, let's compute that more accurately.

0.99767^4.

Let me compute ln(0.99767) = approx -0.00233.

Multiply by 4: -0.00933.

Exponentiate: e^-0.00933 ≈ 1 - 0.00933 + 0.00933^2/2 - ... 

0.00933 is about 0.0093. 0.0093^2 is about 8.6e-5.

So 1 - 0.00933 = 0.99067. Plus 8.6e-5 / 2 = 4.3e-5 → 0.99067 + 0.000043 ≈ 0.990713.

Hmm, which matches our earlier approximation of 0.9907.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.227.

So, 2.227 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me check whether I've considered all factors correctly.

Wait, the problem states that Star_1 and Star_2 have the same observed peak wavelengths. So the Doppler effect for Star_2 shifts its intrinsic peak wavelength to match Star_1's. So, we correctly accounted for that by getting T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ), leading to a slightly higher temperature for Star_2.

Wait, but that's a small effect. So the luminosity factor would be (1.5)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ), which is 2.25 * (1/(1.002333^4)).

Wait, 1.002333^4 is approx 1.009366, so 1/1.009366 is about 0.9907.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227, which is ~2.23, option D.

So I think the correct answer is D.


Astronomers are comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, which have the same observed peak wavelengths. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The radial velocities of the stars are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Using the blackbody radiation formula and Wien's Law, the problem is analyzed as follows:

1. **Observed Wavelengths and Temperatures**:  
   Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the Doppler effect must adjust the intrinsic temperatures of the stars. For Star_2, the radial velocity of 700 km/s introduces a redshift, meaning its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic wavelength. This implies that Star_2's intrinsic temperature must be slightly higher than Star_1's to compensate for the redshift.

   Using the Doppler shift formula for wavelength,  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c),
   \]  
   where \(v_r\) is the radial velocity and \(c\) is the speed of light, the relationship between the intrinsic wavelengths of the two stars is:  
   \[
   \lambda_{1,\text{rest}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c).
   \]  
   Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\) from Wien's Law, the temperature relationship becomes:  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_r/c).
   \]  
   With \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\),  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + 0.002333) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333.
   \]  
   Thus, \(T_2\) is slightly higher than \(T_1\).

2. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the blackbody formula:  
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4.
   \]  
   The ratio of the luminosities is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333\),  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
   \]  
   First, calculate \((T_1 / T_2)^4\):  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767.
   \]  
   Using the binomial expansion for small \(x\),  
   \[
   (0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.002333 + \text{higher-order terms} \approx 0.9907.
   \]  
   Next, calculate \((R_1 / R_2)^2\):  
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
   \]  
   Finally, combine the results:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227.
   \]  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**Answer: D**
