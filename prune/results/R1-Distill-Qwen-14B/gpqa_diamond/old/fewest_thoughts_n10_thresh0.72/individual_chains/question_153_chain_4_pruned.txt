Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about three different reactions, labeled A, B, and C. Each reaction involves specific reactants and conditions, and we need to determine the major products. Then, we match them with the options provided.

First, I'll tackle reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (the enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

So dimethyl malonate is a good source of enolate. It has two ester groups, so under basic conditions, it can form an enolate. Wait, no, wait. Actually, malonate esters are typically used as the nucleophile in the Michael reaction because they are good at forming enolates. So the enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has a structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (if I number from the ester group). The p-tolyl group is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

When the enolate attacks, it will add to the beta carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). So the attack is at the E position. Then, the addition would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So, the product A would combine the two reactants. Let me think about the structures. The enolate from dimethyl malonate has a negative charge on the central carbon. When it attacks the acrylate, it'll add to the beta carbon, so the structure would become:

The malonate part would have the two ester groups and a new substituent from the acrylate. Wait, wait. Let me draw this mentally. The acrylate is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The enolate (from dimethyl malonate) is, say, CH2-C(-OEt)-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. When it forms an enolate, the structure is CH2-C- COOCH3, where the C is deprotonated and has a negative charge. But wait, no. Wait, the structure of dimethyl malonate is H2C(COOCH3)2. So the central carbon is the alpha, and the beta is the adjacent one. So, in the enolate, one alpha proton is removed, forming a double bond between the two central carbons. So the enolate is CH2–C–, with a negative charge on the central C.

Wait, but when it attacks the acrylate, the enolate's alpha carbon (the one that was deprotonated) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the enolate (from malonate) adds to the acrylate's CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

So the addition would form a new bond between the enolate's alpha C and the acrylate's beta C. So the product would have a new structure where the malonate has added to the acrylate.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the product structure. So, when the enolate attacks the acrylate, the acrylate's CH2 is connected to the malonate. So the product would have a structure like CH2-C(COOCH3)2 connected to a CH2-CH(p-tol
