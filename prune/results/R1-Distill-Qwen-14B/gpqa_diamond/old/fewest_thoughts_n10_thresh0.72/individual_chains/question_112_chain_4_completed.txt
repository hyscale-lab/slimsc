Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation has elements A_ij. A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Wait, the matrix representation of the operator is given as A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So that's the matrix.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator A. So, the eigenstates of A are the states in which a measurement of A will give a definite value. So, to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Then, the probability of each eigenstate will be the square of the amplitude.

But wait, first I think we need to normalize |alpha> because it's only given as proportional. So, let's get started.

First, let's write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>

But since |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis, the inner product of |alpha> with itself will give us the normalization factor.

Let me compute the inner product <alpha|alpha>:

= (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) ?

Wait, no. Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, so the conjugate transpose (bra) would be (1-i)<up| + (2 +i)<down|.

So, <alpha|alpha> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i)

Because when you take the inner product, the terms are:

(1-i)(1+i) [from |up><up|] + (1-i)(2-i) [from |up><down|] + (2+i)(1+i) [from |down><up|] + (2+i)(2-i) [from |down><down|].

Wait, no, because |alpha> is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, so when you compute <alpha|alpha>, it's the sum of each coefficient multiplied by its conjugate for |up> and |down>.

So, <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|² + |2 -i|².

Wait, that's because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so <up|down> is 0.

So, |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2? Because |a + ib|² is a² + b². So 1^2 +1^2 = 2.

Wait, 1+i: the modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Similarly, |2 -i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So, <alpha|alpha> = 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator A. Its matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So, it's a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal is zero and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. This operator is actually the Pauli X operator multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) * X.

Wait, but the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X because scaling a matrix by a scalar doesn't change its eigenvectors, only the eigenvalues.

Wait, the eigenvalues of X are +1 and -1. So, the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)*1 = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)*(-1) = -ħ/2.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me confirm that. The eigenstates of X are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), which correspond to |up> and |down> in this problem. So yes, our |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z, but for the operator A (which is proportional to X), the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are combinations of |up> and |down>.

So, our state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of |+x> and |−x> to find the probabilities.

But perhaps another approach is to find the expectation value of A, which is <alpha| A |alpha>, and that would give the average value. Alternatively, the expectation value can be found using the matrix elements.

Wait, but the problem asks for the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A and the average value of A.

So, the probabilities will be |c_+|² and |c_-|², where c_+ and c_- are the coefficients when |alpha> is written as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value and then find the probabilities.

Let me see. Let me first compute the expectation value of A.

The expectation value <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is given as a 2x2 matrix, let's write it down:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

The state |alpha> can be written as a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, wait, no, because in terms of the basis |up> and |down>, the vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, the matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], so when we compute A|alpha>, it's:

A|alpha> = [ (0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2−i)/sqrt(7) ), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2−i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

So, that becomes:

[ ( (ħ/2)(2−i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (ħ/2)(1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> with A|alpha>. But wait, no, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

Wait, |alpha> is a column vector, so <alpha| is a row vector with elements (1−i)/sqrt(7) and (2+i)/sqrt(7).

So, <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1−i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

Let me compute it step by step.

First, compute A|alpha>:

A|alpha> = [ ( (ħ/2)(2−i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (ħ/2)(1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

So, the first component is (ħ/2)(2−i)/sqrt(7), and the second component is (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> = (1−i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2)(2−i)/sqrt(7) ] + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Simplify each term.

First term: (1−i)(2−i) * (ħ/2) / (7)

Let me compute (1−i)(2−i) = 2(1) + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2*(-i)
Wait, let me calculate it properly. (1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
But i^2 is -1, so:
= 2 -3i + (-1)
= 1 -3i

Wait, no. Wait, (1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i + (-1)
= 1 -3i.

So the first term is (1 -3i) * (ħ/2) /7.

Wait, but wait, the denominator is (sqrt(7)) * (sqrt(7))=7.

So, the first term is (1−i)(2−i) = 1-3i, so (1-3i)*(ħ/2) /7.

Wait, actually, the first part is (1−i) multiplied by (2−i), which is 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i² = 2 -3i -1 = (2-1) -3i = 1-3i.

So that's part one.

Now the second term is (2+i)(1+i) times (ħ/2) /7.

Compute (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2 +3i -1 = (2-1) +3i =1 +3i.

So, the second term is (1 +3i)*(ħ/2)/7.

Now, sum the two terms:

[ (1−3i) + (1+3i) ] * (ħ/2) /7.

The imaginary parts cancel out: (1−3i +1 +3i) = 2.

So, 2 * (ħ/2) /7 = (ħ) /7.

So the expectation value <A> is ħ/7.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because when I compute <A>, it's (1−i)/sqrt(7) times the first component of A|alpha> plus (2+i)/sqrt(7) times the second component of A|alpha>. So perhaps I miscalculated the terms.

Wait, let me recompute <A> step by step.

The first term is:

(1−i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2)(2−i) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1−i)(2−i) * ħ/(2*7)

Similarly, the second term is:

(2+i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2)(1+i) / sqrt(7) ]

= (2+i)(1+i) * ħ/(2*7)

So each term is multiplied by ħ/(14).

Wait, because 2*7 is 14, right? So 2*7=14, so denominator is 14.

So, the first term is (1−i)(2−i) = as before, 1-3i.

Second term is (2+i)(1+i) = as before, 1+3i.

So together, (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So, <A> = 2 * (ħ/(14)) ) = (2 ħ) /14 = ħ/7.

So, the expectation value is ħ/7. Looking at the options, option A has average hbar/7, but let me check the other options.

Now, moving on to the probabilities. The probabilities are the square magnitudes of the coefficients when |alpha> is expressed in the eigenbasis of A.

The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, we need to find the components of |alpha> in this basis.

Let me express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

So, |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

Expanding |+x> and |−x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ − c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But we know from earlier that |alpha> is expressed as ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + ( (2−i)/sqrt(7) ) |down>.

So, setting the coefficients equal:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
( c_+ − c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2−i)/sqrt(7).

So we have two equations:

1. (c_+ + c_-) = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
2. (c_+ - c_-) = (2−i) / sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)

Let me write sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) as 1/sqrt(7/2) = sqrt(2/7). So:

c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7),
c_+ - c_- = (2−i) * sqrt(2/7).

We can solve these two equations for c_+ and c_-.

Adding the two equations:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So, c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = (3/sqrt(14)) ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = wait, 3/(2 sqrt(7/2)) )? Hmm, perhaps better to write as (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3/(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Alternatively, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(14)/7, so 3 * sqrt(2/7) /2 = 3 sqrt(14) /14.

Wait, sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(14)/7, because sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(2) / sqrt(7) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)/7 = sqrt(14)/7.

So, 3 * sqrt(14) / (2 *7) )= 3 sqrt(14)/(14).

Wait, let me compute c_+:

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7) / 2
= (3) * sqrt(2/7) / 2
= (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting the two equations:

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (1 + i -2 +i) ) * sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
So, c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) / 2.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute c_+ and c_- in terms of the original |alpha> coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to calculate the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>.

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue ħ/2 is |< +x | alpha > |², and the probability for eigenvalue -ħ/2 is |< -x | alpha > |².

So, compute < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1−i)/sqrt(7) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1−i + 2 +i ) / sqrt(7) ]

Because when you take the inner product, each term is the conjugate of the coefficient in |alpha>.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, so <up|alpha> = (1+i), <down|alpha> = (2−i).

Wait wait, no, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So, <up|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
<down|alpha> = (2−i)/sqrt(7).

So, < +x | alpha > = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) |alpha>
= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

Combine the terms in the numerator:

= [ (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (3) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= 3 / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )
= 3 / sqrt(14)

So, the amplitude c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), and its magnitude squared is (3^2)/(14) )=9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9 divided by 14 is approximately 0.6429.

Similarly, compute <−x | alpha >.

|−x> is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, <−x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| − <down| ] |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) − (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i -2 +i ) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7) ]

= ( -1 + 2i ) / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait, magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (14) )=5/14.

Wait, so the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 (for c_+), and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571 (for c_-).

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. Wait, 9+5=14, so 9+5=14, which sums to 1, so that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Option D says 0.61, 0.29, which doesn't match.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. And 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36 when rounded. So option A has 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but option A's average is hbar/7, which matches what I found earlier.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, avg hbar/7.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, avg 2 hbar/sqrt(7).

Wait, but the average I found is hbar/7, which is option A.

Wait, but in the options, option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which sum to 1, and the average is hbar/7. So that would make option A the correct one.

But wait, when I calculated the probabilities, I got 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. So 0.6429 is about 0.64, and 0.3571 is approx 0.36.

So, the probabilities are ~0.64 and ~0.36, and the expectation value is ħ/7. So option A fits.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

So, the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value. Because when I computed <A>, I got ħ/7, which is correct. Because operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and the expectation value is (|c_+|^2)(ħ/2) + (|c_-|^2)(-ħ/2).

Wait, because |c_+|^2 is 9/14, and |c_-|^2 is 5/14.

So, <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) 

= [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * ħ/2 ]

= (4/14) * ħ/2

= (2/7) * ħ/2 

= ħ/(7).

Yes, that's correct.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and the expectation value is ħ/7. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle
\]

The normalization factor is computed as:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle)
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the inner products:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

The average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Probabilities: \( 0.64 \), \( 0.36 \); Average value: \( \hbar / 7 \)**.
