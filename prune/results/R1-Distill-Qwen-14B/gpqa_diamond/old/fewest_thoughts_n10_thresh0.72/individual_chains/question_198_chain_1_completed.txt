Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about the stability constants of cobalt complexes and figuring out the percentage of a specific blue dithiocyanato complex. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, so that's the second species, right? Or wait, maybe the blue one is a different one. Oh wait, the blue is the dithiocyanato, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, so that's the β2 case, β2=40.

Wait, no, wait. The stability constants are for different complexes. Let me think. The complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh wait, the stability constants are for the stepwise formation. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc.

So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which corresponds to β2=40. So I need to calculate the fraction of that complex compared to all possible cobalt species.

The approach here is to calculate the distribution of each complex species and find the fraction that's the dithiocyanato (β2) complex.

The general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants and the concentrations to find the fraction of each species. But with four possible complexes, it could get a bit complicated. Let me think about how to approach this.

The formation of complexes occurs stepwise. The stability constant for each step is given, so the overall stability constant for the nth complex would be the product of the βs up to that step. Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, each β is the stepwise formation constant. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-. β2 is for adding another SCN^- to form [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, so the overall for the second complex would be β1 * β2, and so on.

Wait, no. Wait, the formation constants (β) are for each step. So for each additional SCN-, the β is multiplied. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^2−n is the product of β1, β2, ..., βn.

Wait, but in this problem, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So they are stepwise, each representing the addition of one SCN-.

So the overall β for each species would be:

β1: [CoSCN+] = β1 = 9.

β_total_2 = β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

β_total_3 = β1*β2*β3=360*63=22680.

β_total_4= β1*β2*β3*β4=22680*16=362880.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Another approach is considering each complex as a separate species and using the β's to calculate their relative concentrations.

Alternatively, another method is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, but maybe it's easier to use the concept of the distribution of species based on the formation constants.

The formula for the fraction of each complex in solution is given by the formation constant and the concentrations of the ions involved. The fraction is proportional to the product of the formation constants and the ratio of the concentrations of the ligands.

Wait, for a general complex with n ligands, the fraction f_n is:

f_n = ( β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / ( 1 + [Co^2+] [SCN^-] (β1 + β1 β2 + β1 β2 β3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 ... βn ) ) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the general approach is that the fraction of each species is given by the product of the respective β's and the ligand concentrations, divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible n.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

The fraction f_n of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is:

f_n = ( β_1 β_2 ... β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / D

Where D is the sum over all possible n of (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) plus the term for the free Co^2+ (which would be 1 when n=0, but wait, when n=0, the term is [Co^2+] multiplied by the product of β's up to zero terms. Hmm, maybe it's better to express the denominator as:

D = [Co^2+] + [Co^2+][SCN^-]^1 β1 + [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 β1 β2 + [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 β1 β2 β3 + ... etc.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each step adds a ligand, multiplying by the respective β. So the denominator D is the sum of all possible species, including the free ion.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it as:

The fraction of species n is:

f_n = ( β_1 β_2 ... β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n ) / D,

where D is the sum over all possible n (from 0 to 4 in this case) of (β_1 ... β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) plus 1 (for n=0, the free Co^2+).

Wait, no. Because for n=0, the species is Co^2+ itself, which doesn't have any ligands. So the term for n=0 is [Co^2+] = c(Co).

But in the denominator, all terms are expressed with [Co^2+] and [SCN^-] raised to their respective n. So perhaps the denominator is:

D = [Co^2+] + [Co^2+][SCN^-]β1 + [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 β1 β2 + [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 β1 β2 β3 + [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 β1 β2 β3 β4.

Wait, but that seems correct. Because each term represents the concentration of the complex with n ligands.

So the fraction for each species is then (β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) divided by D.

Wait, but in our problem, [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So, let me compute each term in the denominator.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as c = 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] as s = 0.1 M.

Then,

Term for n=0: c * s^0 * product(β for n=0 terms) => n=0, so product is 1. So term0 = c = 1e-2.

n=1: c * s^1 * β1 = 1e-2 * 0.1 * 9 = 1e-2 * 0.1 is 1e-3, times 9 is 9e-3.

n=2: c * s^2 * β1 β2 = 1e-2 * 0.01 * 9*40 = 1e-2 * 0.01 is 1e-4, multiplied by 360 (9*40) is 3.6e-2.

n=3: c * s^3 * β1 β2 β3 = 1e-2 * 0.001 * 9*40*63 = 1e-2 * 0.001 is 1e-5, multiplied by 22680 (9*40*63=22680) gives 22680 * 1e-5 = 0.2268.

n=4: c * s^4 * β1 β2 β3 β4 = 1e-2 * (0.1)^4 = 1e-2 * 1e-4 = 1e-6. Multiply by 9*40*63*16=9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. So term4= 1e-6 * 362880 = 0.36288.

So now, let's list all terms:

term0: 1e-2 = 0.01

term1: 9e-3 = 0.009

term2: 0.036

term3: 0.2268

term4: 0.36288

Now, sum all terms to get D:

D = 0.01 + 0.009 + 0.036 + 0.2268 + 0.36288.

Let me add them step by step.

0.01 + 0.009 = 0.019

0.019 + 0.036 = 0.055

0.055 + 0.2268 = 0.2818

0.2818 + 0.36288 = 0.64468.

So D = 0.64468.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check each term.

Let me recalculate n=3 and n=4 terms to make sure.

n=3:

c * s^3 = 0.01 * (0.1)^3 = 0.01 * 0.001 = 0.00001.

β1 β2 β3 = 9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680.

So term3 = 0.00001 * 22680 = 0.2268, yes.

n=4:

c * s^4 = 0.01 * (0.1)^4 = 0.01 * 0.0001= 1e-6.

β1 β2 β3 β4 = 22680 *16=362880.

term4= 1e-6 * 362880 = 0.36288, correct.

Ok, so D is 0.64468.

The fraction f for each species n is term_n / D.

But the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2 (since it's the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ complex).

So f2 = term2 / D = 0.036 / 0.64468.

Let me compute that.

0.036 / 0.64468.

0.036 ÷ 0.64468 ≈ 0.05555... which is approximately 5.555%. Wait, that can't be right. Because looking at the options, none of them is that low. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the terms. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of term2.

Wait, term2: c * s^2 * β1 β2.

c is 0.01, s is 0.1. So s^2 is 0.01. So 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.0001.

Multiply by β1 β2=9 *40=360. So 0.0001 * 360 = 0.036. Yes, correct.

Hmm, but if the fraction is 0.036 / 0.64468 ≈ 0.05555, that's 5.555%, but the options don't include that. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the β values are given as overall stability constants, not stepwise. Oh wait, that's possible. Because sometimes in problems, β is given as the overall formation constant for the complex, not the stepwise ones.

Wait, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, maybe β represents the overall formation constant for each complex, not stepwise. So for [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), the overall β is 9; for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2), β is 40; for [Co(SCN)_3]^3- (n=3), β=63; and [Co(SCN)_4]^4- (n=4), β=16.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the overall β should increase with the number of ligands if the complexes are more stable. Here, β4 is 16, less than β3=63. So perhaps the βs are stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses other notation, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses β values as the formation constants for each step. So β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ from [CoSCN]^+ and SCN^-, and so on. So the overall β for each complex would be the product of the stepwise βs.

But in that case, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be β1 * β2 =9 *40=360. Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, it's β1*β2*β3=360*63=22680, and for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-, it's 22680*16=362880.

So the overall βs for each complex are:

n=1: 9

n=2: 360

n=3: 22680

n=4: 362880.

Hmm, but that would make the denominator terms as follows:

Each term is [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n * (β1 β2 ... βn).

So let's recast the terms with this in mind.

So for each n, the term is [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n * β1*β2*...βn.

Wait, no. Because each step's formation constant is multiplied. So the overall β for n=2 is β1 * β2.

But wait, the problem states that the β values are the stability constants for each complex. So perhaps for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), the βn is the overall stability constant.

If that's the case, then for n=1, β1=9, which is [Co(SCN)]^+.

n=2: β2=40.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the formation for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would have an overall β of 40, which is lower than β3=63. That seems odd, but maybe that's how it's given.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the stability would typically increase with more ligands, but not necessarily. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are the cumulative stability constants, meaning that βn is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands.

So:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) ) =9.

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) )=40.

β3 [Co(SCN)_3^3-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) )=63.

β4 [Co(SCN)_4^4-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) )=16.

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3=63. That would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible but a bit unusual. But perhaps that's how the problem is set up.

If that's the case, then the overall β for each complex is as given. So the formula for each species would be:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So to find the fraction of each species, the formula is:

f_n = (βn [Co][SCN]^n) / (sum over all m (βm [Co][SCN]^m) + [Co] )

Because [Co] is the free ion, which is when n=0, but in the denominator, when n=0, the term is [Co^2+] itself.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The denominator would be the sum of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) for all n from 0 to 4, plus the free Co^2+.

But wait, the free Co^2+ is when there are zero ligands, so n=0. So the term for n=0 is [Co^2+] = c = 1e-2 M.

So the denominator would be sum_{n=0}^4 ( [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) ) + [Co^2+].

But each [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) can be expressed as βn [Co]^2+ [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, no. The expression is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So the terms in the denominator would be:

term0: [Co^2+] = 0.01.

term1: β1 [Co][SCN]^1 =9 * 0.01 * 0.1 = 0.0009.

term2: β2 [Co][SCN]^2 =40 *0.01 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01 *0.01=0.0004.

term3: β3 [Co][SCN]^3 =63 *0.01 * (0.1)^3 =63 *0.01 *0.001=6.3e-6.

term4: β4 [Co][SCN]^4 =16 *0.01 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.01 *0.0001=1.6e-6.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute each term correctly.

Compute term1:

β1=9, [Co]=0.01, [SCN]=0.1.

So term1=9 * 0.01 *0.1 = 9 * 0.001 =0.009.

Similarly, term2=40 *0.01*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01 *0.01=40 * 0.0001=0.004.

term3=63 *0.01*(0.1)^3=63 *0.01 *0.001=63 * 1e-5=0.00063.

term4=16 *0.01*(0.1)^4=16 *0.01 *0.0001=16 * 1e-6=0.000016.

Wait, but wait. If the βs are the overall stability constants, then each term in the denominator is (βn * c * s^n ), and then add the term for n=0 (c).

So the denominator D is:

D = c + β1 c s + β2 c s^2 + β3 c s^3 + β4 c s^4.

So substituting:

c=0.01, s=0.1.

term0: 0.01.

term1:9 *0.01 *0.1=0.009.

term2:40 *0.01 *0.01=0.004.

term3:63 *0.01 *0.001=0.00063.

term4:16 *0.01 *0.0001=0.000016.

So D = 0.01 + 0.009 + 0.004 + 0.00063 + 0.000016.

Adding them up:

0.01 + 0.009 = 0.019.

0.019 +0.004 =0.023.

0.023 +0.00063 =0.02363.

0.02363 +0.000016=0.023646.

So D=0.023646.

Wait, but wait, that's the sum of all terms. Now, the fraction for n=2 is (β2 * c * s^2) / D.

So f2 = (40 *0.01 *0.01) / 0.023646.

Compute numerator: 40 *0.01 *0.01 =40 *0.0001=0.004.

So f2=0.004 / 0.023646 ≈ 0.169, which is about 16.9%. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer. But wait, earlier I thought the βs were stepwise, but this approach seems to give an option that's present.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Because if the βs are the overall constants, then the approach is as above. But when I considered them as stepwise, I got a much lower percentage (about 5.55%), which wasn't an option. So perhaps the βs here are the overall constants, not stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial approach. Let me think: when the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16," it's likely that each β is the overall constant for the complex with that many ligands. So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9; for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β2=40; for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, β3=63; and for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-, β4=16.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing because β4 is less than β3. But perhaps that's how the problem is set up. So with that, the calculation leads to f2=16.9%, which is option D. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So according to this, the answer would be D) 16.9%.

Wait, but the options include C)38.1%, which is higher than 16.9%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are given as stepwise formation constants. Let me try that approach again.

If the βs are stepwise, then the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for n=1, overall β is 9.

n=2:9*40=360.

n=3:9*40*63=22680.

n=4:22680 *16=362880.

Then, the denominator terms would be:

term0: c=1e-2.

term1: c * s * β1=0.01 *0.1 *9=0.0009.

term2: c * s^2 * β1 β2=0.01 *0.01 *360=0.0036.

term3: c * s^3 * β1 β2 β3=0.01 *0.001 *22680=0.2268.

term4: c * s^4 * β1 β2 β3 β4=0.01 *1e-4 *362880=0.36288.

So D = 0.01 + 0.0009 + 0.0036 +0.2268 +0.36288.

Adding up:

0.01 +0.0009=0.0109.

+0.0036=0.0145.

+0.2268=0.2413.

+0.36288=0.60418.

So D=0.60418.

Then, the fraction f2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is term2 / D = 0.0036 / 0.60418 ≈ 0.005957, which is about 0.5957% which isn't matching any options. So that can't be right.

Wait, this can't be correct because none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses logβ? No, the question gives β as 9,40, etc., which are not in log scale. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of each species using the given βs as stepwise, but perhaps the starting point is the free Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to assume that the solution is at equilibrium, and the concentrations of all species sum up to the initial concentration of Co^2+.

So, the sum of [Co^2+], [CoSCN^+], [Co(SCN)_2^2+], [Co(SCN)_3^3-], [Co(SCN)_4^4-] equals c(Co) =0.01 M.

But with the presence of excess SCN^-, (0.1 M), the formation of complexes is favored.

Wait, but perhaps the approach is to calculate each complex's concentration using the formation constants.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps looking for another approach.

Alternatively, since the [SCN^-] is much higher than [Co^2+], the complexes may form extensively.

Another thought: perhaps use the approximation that [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M because it's in large excess, so it doesn't change much upon complex formation. Then, the concentration of SCN^- is approximately 0.1 M.

In that case, the concentration of each complex can be calculated as:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

The total concentration of Co is sum_{n=0}^4 [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n)} = 0.01 M.

But [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, so [SCN^-]^n = (0.1)^n.

So, for each n:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) = βn * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^n.

The sum is:

[Co^2+] * [1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4 ] = 0.01.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is the free ion. So, let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

So,

x * (1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4 ) = 0.01.

If I can compute the sum inside the brackets, I can find x, and then compute the fraction for each complex.

Let's compute each term:

β1*(0.1) =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

β3*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

β4*(0.1)^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

So sum =1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016.

Adding them:

1 +0.9=1.9.

+0.4=2.3.

+0.063=2.363.

+0.0016=2.3646.

So the equation is x * 2.3646 =0.01 → x= 0.01 /2.3646≈0.004225 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

n=0: x =0.004225 M.

n=1: β1 x (0.1) =9 *0.004225 *0.1=0.00038025.

n=2: β2 x (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=0.000169.

n=3: β3 x (0.1)^3=63 *0.004225 *0.001=0.0000264825.

n=4: β4 x (0.1)^4=16 *0.004225 *0.0001=0.000000676.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation for n=2. Let me recompute:

n=2: β2=40.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ =40 * x * (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=40 * 0.00004225=0.00169 M.

Wait, 0.004225 * 0.01=0.00004225. Multiply by40: 0.00169.

Similarly, n=1: 9 *0.004225 *0.1=0.00038025.

n=3:63 *0.004225 *0.001=63 * 0.000004225=0.000264825.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Since [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, each term is βn * x * (0.1)^n.

Wait, let me compute each term:

n=0: x=0.004225.

n=1:9 *0.004225 *0.1=0.00038025.

n=2:40 *0.004225 *0.01=0.000169.

n=3:63 *0.004225 *0.001=0.000264825.

n=4:16 *0.004225 *0.0001=0.000000676.

But wait, when I sum all these, they should add up to 0.01.

Sum:

0.004225 + 0.00038025=0.00460525.

+0.000169 →0.00477425.

+0.000264825 →0.005039075.

+0.000000676 →0.005039751.

But 0.005 is much less than 0.01. So this can’t be right. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the sum of all the complex concentrations plus the free Co^2+ must equal 0.01.

Wait, but with the way I set it up, that's correct. Because x is the free Co^2+.

So the sum is x + (β1 x s) + (β2 x s^2 ) + ... = x (1 + β1 s + β2 s^2 + ...) )=0.01.

So yes, that's correct. But then when I compute the individual concentrations, their sum should equal 0.01.

Wait, but when I sum them up, I get 0.005, which is less than 0.01. So I'm missing something here.

Ah, no, wait. I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the individual terms. Let me recompute each term with x=0.004225.

n=0: x=0.004225.

n=1:9 *0.004225 *0.1 = 9 * 0.0004225=0.0038025.

Wait, wait, 0.004225 *0.1=0.0004225. Multiply by9: 0.0038025.

n=2:40 *0.004225 *0.01=40*(0.00004225)=0.00169.

n=3:63 *0.004225 *0.001=63*0.000004225=0.000264825.

n=4:16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16 *0.0000004225=0.00000676.

Now sum all:

n0=0.004225.

n1=0.0038025 → sum so far: 0.0080275.

n2=0.00169 → sum 0.0097175.

n3=0.000264825 → sum 0.009982325.

n4=0.00000676 → sum 0.009989085.

Wait, that's about 0.009989 M, which is very close to 0.01 M. So that's correct.

So, the concentration of each species is:

n=0:0.004225 M.

n=1:0.0038025 M.

n=2:0.00169 M.

n=3:0.000264825 M.

n=4:0.00000676 M.

Now, the question is the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2: 0.00169 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so the fraction is (0.00169 / 0.01) *100% =16.9%.

So the answer is D)16.9%.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the βs as the overall constants, I got the same result. So perhaps that's correct.

But wait, the options include 38%, which would be if the βs were used as stepwise and calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Another possibility is that the problem uses the logarithms of the stability constants, but that's unlikely because β is given as 9,40, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the fraction based on the βs as stepwise, but considering the formation of each complex in sequence.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the fraction f_n as:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

So for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2), f2 is:

(β1 β2 [Co][SCN]^2) / D, where D is the sum of all terms from n=0 to 4.

Earlier, when I calculated with stepwise βs, I got:

n=0:0.01.

n=1:0.0009.

n=2:0.0036.

n=3:0.2268.

n=4:0.36288.

Sum D=0.60418.

f2=0.0036/0.60418≈0.005957, which is 0.5957% of the total, which is not one of the options.

But according to the previous approach, using βs as overall constants, the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm getting confused now because two different approaches are leading to different answers. Which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which approach aligns with the given options. Since the option D is 16.9% and that's what I get with the overall βs, and the other approach doesn't give an option, perhaps the correct way is to treat each β as the overall constant.

So the correct answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Cobalt concentration**: \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**:  
  \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

The stability constants are interpreted as **overall formation constants** for the respective complexes:
- \( \beta_1 \): \( [\text{CoSCN}^+] / ([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]) \),
- \( \beta_2 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] / ([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^2) \),
- \( \beta_3 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^{3-}] / ([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^3) \),
- \( \beta_4 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{4-}] / ([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^4) \).

The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^{3-}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{4-}] = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of each complex is given by:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n.
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] \), is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Total}}.
\]

The denominator, Total, is the sum of all cobalt species:
\[
\text{Total} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4.
\]

### Calculations:
1. **Numerator for \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] \):**
   \[
   \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.004.
   \]

2. **Denominator (Total):**
   - \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = 0.01 \),
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.01 \cdot 0.1 = 0.009 \),
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 0.004 \),
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.01 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.00063 \),
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.01 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.000016 \).

   Summing these:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 0.01 + 0.009 + 0.004 + 0.00063 + 0.000016 = 0.023646.
   \]

3. **Fraction of \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] \):**
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.004}{0.023646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{(or 16.9\%)}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] \), among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
