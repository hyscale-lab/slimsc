Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions, so numbering them 1, 2, 3, etc. So the substituents are:

- Position 1: ethoxy group (OCH2CH3)
- Position 2: tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3)
- Position 3: nitro group (NO2)

So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a row. Wait, but in benzene, the positions can't be all adjacent because the ring is cyclic. Wait, no, maybe it's 1,2,3 as in three positions in sequence. So that's like 1, 2, and 3 in a way that each is next to the other. So, for example, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. Or maybe the numbering is different. Wait, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So that would be at ortho, meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, but how can all three be attached? Let me think: the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So I think the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, substituent at 1 is ethoxy, at 2 is tert-butyl, and at 3 is nitro. So in a way, they're all adjacent in the ringâ€”1, 2, 3 positions. But wait, that's three adjacent substituents, which might be a bit tricky.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, but 1 and 3 are meta to each other. So, the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the ring would have ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3, making a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with those groups.

Now, the problem is to synthesize this from benzene, and the question gives four options of reaction sequences, each with multiple steps.

I remember that when you're adding substituents to benzene, the order can matter because each substitution can direct the next steps. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing effects of the substituents already on the ring.

So, let's think about the possible substituents and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) is an electron-donating group; it's an activating group and ortho/para-directing.
- tert-butyl group is a bulky, electron-donating (through alkyl groups) group; it's activating and ortho/para-directing but due to its bulk, may prefer para or meta positions when possible, but in some cases, the regiochemistry is influenced by steric factors.
- Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So if I have a nitro group, the next substitution would be at a meta position relative to it. But if I already have other groups, their directing effects come into play.

But wait, in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3, and ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So perhaps the nitro group is in the meta position relative to one of the other substit
