Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem describes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Hmm, meta means they are separated by two carbons, right? So, if I imagine the benzene ring, these three groups are each at positions that are three apart from each other.

Wait, but wait. The numbering can get a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize this. Suppose I start numbering the ring. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, meta to it would be position 4 and 6, but wait, three positions away. Oh wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, meta positions are two away in either direction. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, its meta positions are 3 and 5.

But the problem says all three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano) are meta to one another. Wait, that means each of them is in a meta position relative to each other. That might form a sort of triangle on the ring. Let me think. If the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde would be at position 3, and the cyano at position 5
