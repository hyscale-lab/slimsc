Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l = 1. So each electron has l₁ and l₂ both equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, I think this represents the state where the individual angular momenta are l₁=1 and l₂=1, and their total is l=2, with a magnetic quantum number m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for both electrons. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Each electron's orbital angular momentum L_z has eigenvalues mħ, where m can be -l, ..., +l. So for each electron, since l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So L₁z and L₂z each have possible eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, +ħ.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that when combining angular momenta, the coupled state is a combination of all possible product states of the individual states. So the state |l₁, l₂, l, m> is a combination of |l₁ m₁> ⊗ |l₂ m₂>, such that m₁ + m₂ = m.

In this case, l₁=1, l₂=1, l=2, and m=-1. So the combined state must be a sum of states where m₁ + m₂ = -1. For l=2, m can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. Wait, but the given state has m=-1.

Let me think. The total state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of the products |m₁, m₂> where m₁ + m₂ = -1. Each term in this combination has m₁ and m₂ such that their sum is -1.

So what are the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs for this sum? Since each m₁ and m₂ can be -1, 0, +1. So possibilities for m₁ + m₂ = -1 are:

m₁ = -1, m₂=0 → (-1) + 0 = -1
m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → 0 + (-1) = -1

Are there any others? Let's see: 

-1 + 0 = -1, 0 + (-1) = -1. What about m1=-1 and m2=0, same as the first case. Are there any other combinations? If m1= -2, but wait, l=1 so m can't be -2. So only these two possibilities: m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

Wait, but the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these. So how is it written? The general form for adding angular momenta is:

|l₁ m₁> |l₂ m₂> → coefficients are determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |1,1,2,-1> should be a linear combination of |1 m₁> |1 m₂> where m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So the state is α|1,-1>|1,0> + β|1,0>|1,-1>, where α and β are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But wait, maybe there are more terms? Let me think. For l=2 and m=-1, the possible (m1, m2) are only the two I mentioned because any other combination would sum to something else. So it's a two-term combination.

What are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this? I'm a bit hazy, but I think for l=2, m=-1, the coefficients for (m1, m2) = (-1,0) and (0,-1) are sqrt( (2+1)/(2*(2+1)) ) times something? Wait, perhaps I should recall the general expressions.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l1 m1> |l2 m2> → |L M> is given by:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M >.

In our case, l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Let me look up or think about the coefficients for these.

I think the coefficients are positive and symmetric. Wait, for the state |2, -1>, the expansion would be:

sqrt( (2)(2+
