Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let me take it step by step.

The compound is C9H11NO2. Hmm, the molecular formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. DOF is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 4 DOF) plus a double bond or an amide group or something else.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or an amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester, amide, or ketone. Since the options have amides and esters, that's a clue.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. Let me list out the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That sounds like a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe like an ethyl ester. Because in ethyl groups, the CH2 next to the oxygen is usually around 1.2 as a triplet. Wait, no. Wait, for ethyl groups, the CH3 is a triplet around 1.2, and the adjacent CH2 is a quartet around 4.1 or so. But here, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm for 2H, so maybe that's the CH2 connected to something else.

Then 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad signals can be from exchange with protons, maybe an NH group or an OCH2 group. Wait, but in case of ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the quartet around 4.1. But here the quartet is at 4.5, which is upfield for OCH2. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the NMR again:

- 1.20 ppm
