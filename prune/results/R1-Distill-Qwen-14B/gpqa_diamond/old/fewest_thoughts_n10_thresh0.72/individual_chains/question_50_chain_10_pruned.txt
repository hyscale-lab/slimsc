Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Alright, let's start by recalling some basics about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations.

I remember that each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a certain factor to the amplitude of the process. The number of loops is directly related to the order of the process and the complexity of the calculation. In quantum field theory, loops are associated with the integration over the momenta of the internal propagators, which gives rise to the loop integral.

The general form for the amplitude of a process with a loop diagram involves factors that come from vertices, propagators, and the integration measure. The loop integral typically introduces factors of 1/(16π²) per loop in four-dimensional spacetime, but sometimes other constants like π and powers of it come into play, especially in regularization schemes like dimensional regularization or others.

Looking at the given expression: α³ * g² * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Hmm, let's break this down. α is the fine-structure constant, which is e²/(4πħc), and g is a coupling constant. The (4π)^6 in the denominator suggests that each loop might contribute a (4π)^something factor. Wait, but in loop integrals, each loop usually brings a term like (4π)^{d/2} where d is the spacetime dimension, but since we're in 4D (d=4), each loop would contribute a factor of (4π)^2. Wait, wait, when you compute a loop integral in 4D, you often get a factor of (4π)^2 from the integral. So for each loop, you multiply by 1/(4π)^2. Because, for example, the integral in a loop could be something like ∫d^4k/(k² + m²), which after evaluation gives factors involving 4π².

Wait, but the denominator here is (4π)^6. So if each loop contributes a 1/(4π)^2 factor, then the number of loops would be 6 divided by 2, which is 3. So that suggests 3 loops.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach is to consider the overall scaling with the
