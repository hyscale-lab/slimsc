Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see what I can figure out. The question is about a process where a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other, producing two particles each of charge + and - A. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, right, annihilation processes usually involve converting mass into energy, but in this case, it's creating other particles. So, I remember that in such reactions, conservation laws must apply—like conservation of energy and momentum. Since the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-, that's four particles in total. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can assume it's non-relativistic? Or is that the proton that's moving slowly? Wait, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate it as being at rest in the lab frame? Or is the lab frame where the proton is moving?

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So in the lab frame, the antiproton has low velocity, and the proton is at rest? Or maybe both are moving towards each other with the antiproton having a low speed... Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the system's initial momentum is zero, making it the center-of-momentum frame. Because in the case of annihilation, the products usually come out in opposite directions, but considering the initial momentum, that might not be the case here.

Wait, let me think. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the initial momentum is dominated by the antiproton. But if it's moving slowly, maybe its momentum is negligible compared to some other term. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the center of mass (CM) frame is easier to work in. Because in the CM frame, the total initial momentum is zero, so the products must have zero total momentum as well. That would mean the particles A+ and A- would have to move in such a way that their momenta cancel each other out.

Wait, but in the process, there are two A+ and two A- produced. So perhaps each pair has opposite momenta. Like, maybe two of them are moving in one direction, and the other two in the opposite, but their momenta balance each other. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, but I'm not entirely certain.

But wait, the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, which is either A+ or A-, since they have the same mass. So perhaps all four particles have the same speed? Or maybe they're in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions but same speed. So if that's the case, the total momentum would be zero because each pair's momentum cancels out.

But let's step back. First, I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let's denote their rest mass as m_p c². But wait, in reality, a proton and antiproton have the same rest mass, so m_p = m_p̄. So the total rest mass energy is 2 m_p c². But wait, the problem doesn't give me the mass of the proton, but it does give m_A c² = 300 MeV. So maybe I can find the mass of A in terms of the proton's mass? Or perhaps I can find the relation between the two.

Wait, the annihilation process: proton and antiproton annihilate into two A+ and two A- particles. So the initial rest mass energy is (m_p + m_p̄)c², which is 2 m_p c². The final mass energy includes the rest mass energies of the A particles plus their kinetic energies.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass, so maybe we can consider that the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and all of that goes into the rest mass of the four A particles plus their kinetic energy. But the exact approach is a bit fuzzy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can work in the center of mass frame of the proton and antiproton. In that frame, the total initial momentum is zero. So the final four particles must also have zero total momentum. Since they're moving in pairs, their momenta cancel each other.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial momentum is not zero. Hmm, that complicates things. Because in the lab frame, if the antiproton is moving but the proton is perhaps at rest, then the total initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. So the final particles must have a total momentum equal to that.

Wait, but the proton and antiproton are colliding, so perhaps it's a head-on collision. Let me think: if the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v (which is small, so perhaps we can use non-relativistic approximations), then the total initial energy is the rest energy of the proton plus the energy of the moving antiproton.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is only due to the antiproton, which is moving slowly. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, which is low. So the final particles must have a total momentum equal to that. But since there are four particles produced, perhaps their momenta add up to this initial momentum.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about what's given. The mass of A is 300 MeV. Wait, the problem says m_A c²=300 MeV. So the rest mass energy is 300 MeV. So each A has energy E = γ m_A c².

But to proceed, perhaps I should first calculate the total initial rest mass energy and the total rest mass energy of the products.

Wait, the proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², right? Because m_p c² is about 938 MeV. So 2 m_p c² is about 1876 MeV. But the products are four A particles, each with m_A c² = 300 MeV, so their total rest mass energy is 4*300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial 1876 MeV. So the difference would be the kinetic energy of the products.

But wait, but that's only if the initial kinetic energy is negligible. But in the problem, the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So the initial total energy is approximately (m_p + m_p̄) c² + K_antiproton. Since the antiproton's K is small, perhaps we can approximate the initial energy as 2 m_p c².

But then the final energy would be the sum of the rest masses of the four A particles plus their kinetic energies. So the total energy is conserved.

Wait, but the problem is about finding the velocity of particle A. So maybe the particles are moving non-relativistically, and we can apply non-relativistic energy and momentum equations.

But let's think: assuming that the particles A are moving at a speed much less than c, so that non-relativistic mechanics applies. Then their kinetic energy would be (1/2) m_A v². But wait, in the problem statement, the antiproton is moving slowly, not the A particles. Hmm.

Wait, but the A particles are the products, so maybe their velocities are high. Or perhaps not, depending on the process. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial total energy is 2 m_p c² (since the antiproton's kinetic energy is small and neglected), and the final energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies.

But then, the total energy after annihilation is 4 * m_A c² + K, where K is the total kinetic energy of the four particles.

So, setting 2 m_p c² = 4 m_A c² + K.

But wait, I don't know K. So that's not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using conservation of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame. Let me consider that.

In the center of mass frame, the initial total momentum is zero. So the final total momentum must also be zero.

Since the products are two A+ and two A-, let's consider their velocities. If the system is symmetric, perhaps the two A+ move in one direction and the two A- move in the opposite direction, each with the same speed. So that their momenta cancel each other.

Wait, but that would mean each pair has opposite momentum vectors. So if the A+ are moving in one direction with velocity v, the A- would move in the opposite direction with velocity v, same magnitude. So each would have momentum γ m_A v, but opposite in direction. So the total momentum would be zero.

But that's only if the particles are moving in opposite directions with same speed. Alternatively, perhaps all four particles are moving in two opposite directions, each with a certain velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps each A+ and A- pair has the same speed but opposite directions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the two A+ move in one direction, and the two A- move in the opposite direction, each pair moving with the same speed, so the total momentum cancels.

But perhaps it's easier to model each particle as having the same speed. So each A+ and A- has speed v, but perhaps the A+ are moving in one direction and the A- in the opposite, but their momenta would add up based on their direction.

Wait, but in that case, for each A+ and A- pair, their momentum vectors would be opposite. So if you have two A+ moving in one direction and two A- moving in the opposite, their momentum contributions would be:

For each A+, momentum is γ m_A v in +x direction.

For each A-, momentum is γ m_A v in -x direction.

So for two A+ and two A-, the total momentum would be:

Total = 2*(γ m_A v) - 2*(γ m_A v) = 0.

Yes, that makes sense. So in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the products must also have zero total momentum.

So in the CM frame, the energy is (2 m_p c² + K_initial) → but wait, in the CM frame, the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible because it's moving slowly. Wait, no, in the CM frame, the initial kinetic energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton's kinetic energies, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is small. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the CM frame is close to the lab frame where the antiproton is moving.

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's try another approach.

In the CM frame, the initial energy is (m_p + m_p̄) c² + K_initial, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, K_initial is small, so approximately 2 m_p c². The final energy in the CM frame is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.

Each A particle has energy E = γ m_A c², and since they're moving with speed v, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, in the CM frame, each A particle could have different velocities, but for simplicity, perhaps they all have the same speed, but opposite directions as needed to conserve momentum.

Wait, but perhaps all four particles have the same speed but opposite directions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the four particles are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to zero. So perhaps each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, each with the same speed, so that their momenta cancel each other.

Wait, but there are two A+ and two A-; perhaps they are moving in such a way that two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed. So each contributes +γ m_A v and -γ m_A v, so the total is 2*γ m_A v - 2*γ m_A v = 0.

So yes, their total momentum is zero, as required.

Now, energy conservation in the CM frame: initial energy is 2 m_p c², and the final energy is 4 * γ m_A c².

So:

2 m_p c² = 4 γ m_A c²

Simplify: 2 m_p = 4 γ m_A → γ = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) → γ = m_p / (2 m_A)

Wait, substituting numbers: m_p c² is about 938 MeV, m_A c² is 300 MeV.

So m_p / (2 m_A) = (938 MeV) / (2 * 300 MeV) ) ≈ 938/(600) ≈ 1.563.

So γ ≈ 1.563.

Wait, γ is 1.563, which is greater than 1, which is acceptable because particles are moving at relativistic speeds.

Now, to find the velocity, we can use γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute that.

γ = 1.563 → 1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

→ sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.6406

→ 1 - v²/c² = (0.6406)^2 ≈ 0.410

→ v²/c² = 1 - 0.410 = 0.59 → v = c * sqrt(0.59) ≈ c * 0.768 ≈ 0.77c.

Wait, so that gives a velocity of approximately 0.77c. Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

But wait, perhaps I made an error in assuming the CM frame. Because the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial frame is not the CM frame, but the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Hmm, in that case, the initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton, which is small because it's moving slowly.

Wait, let me think. In the lab frame, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity u, which is small. So the initial momentum is just the antiproton's momentum, p_initial = γ m_p u, where γ is approximately 1 + (u²)/(2 c²) since u is small.

But the final particles must have a total momentum equal to that initial momentum.

But this complicates things because now I have to consider both energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame, which may not be the CM frame.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that the antiproton's kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy, we can approximate γ ≈ 1 and p_initial ≈ m_p u.

So, in the lab frame, initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + K_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p u².

But since u is small, the kinetic energy is much less than the rest mass energy, so K_initial << m_p c². So perhaps E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

The final energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies of the four A particles.

Wait, but now considering that the products must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum, which is m_p u.

So, in the lab frame, the four A particles must have a total momentum of m_p u.

Hmm, but each A has velocity v, but their directions are such that their momenta add up to m_p u.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about whether it's better to proceed with the CM approach or the lab frame approach.

In the CM approach, I found a velocity of about 0.77c, which is option A. But let me check the numbers again. Wait, I thought the initial energy in the CM frame is 2 m_p c², and the final energy is 4 γ m_A c².

Wait, but the initial energy in the CM frame is indeed 2 m_p c², and the products are four A particles, each with energy γ m_A c². So, that gives 4 γ m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → γ = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) → γ = m_p / (2 m_A).

But with m_p = 938 MeV/c², and m_A = 300 MeV/c², that gives γ = 938/(2*300) = 938/600 ≈ 1.563.

So this gives the same result as before, leading to v ≈ 0.77c, which is option A.

But wait, the options also include higher velocities. So I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approximation. Let's compute γ = 1.563 accurately.

Let me compute 1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

→ sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.6406

→ 1 - v²/c² = (0.6406)^2 ≈ 0.4103

→ v²/c² = 1 - 0.4103 = 0.5897 → v = c * sqrt(0.5897) ≈ 0.7678 c ≈ 0.77c.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, but that can't be because their momenta would add up, not cancel. So the correct approach is that the total momentum is zero in the CM frame, leading to each pair having opposite momenta, which gives the velocity as I calculated.

Therefore, the answer should be option A) 0.77c.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. This allows us to approximate the total initial energy as the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton, \( 2m_p c^2 \), where \( m_p \) is the proton mass.

In the center-of-momentum (CM) frame, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero. The four particles \( 2A^+ \) and \( 2A^- \) are produced symmetrically, with their momenta canceling each other out. This symmetry simplifies the analysis, and we can assume all four particles have the same speed \( v \), with their momenta arranged to satisfy momentum conservation.

Using energy conservation in the CM frame, the total initial energy \( 2m_p c^2 \) is equal to the total energy of the four \( A \)-particles, which includes their rest mass energies and kinetic energies. Since the \( A \)-particles are relativistic, their total energy is given by \( \gamma m_A c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \) is the rest mass energy of each \( A \)-particle.

The total energy of the four \( A \)-particles is \( 4\gamma m_A c^2 \). Setting this equal to the initial energy \( 2m_p c^2 \), we solve for \( \gamma \):

\[
2m_p c^2 = 4\gamma m_A c^2
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{2m_p}{4m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2m_A}
\]

Substituting \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} = \frac{938}{600} \approx 1.563
\]

Next, we relate \( \gamma \) to the velocity \( v \) using the equation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):

\[
1.563 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1.563} \approx 0.6406
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = (0.6406)^2 \approx 0.410
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.410 = 0.59
\]

\[
v = c \sqrt{0.59} \approx 0.768c \approx 0.77c
\]

Thus, the velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
