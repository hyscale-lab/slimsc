Okay, so I have this IUPAC nomenclature question here about a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question says that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. So, meta means they are separated by two carbons, right? So if one substituent is in position 1, the next meta would be position 3, and then another meta from there would be position 5, I think. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 3, and 5 are all meta to each other.

Wait, no. Actually, in benzene, the positions are numbered such that substituents that are meta to each other are two positions away. So if substituent A is in position 1, substituent B (meta) would be in position 3, and substituent C (meta to B) would be position 5. So in this case, the three substituents are in positions 1, 3, and 5? Or maybe not, because the question might arrange them differently.

Wait, the question says all three are meta to one another. So all three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano) are meta to each other. That would mean that each is two positions away from the others. But in a six-membered ring, that's possible only if they are in positions 1, 3, and 5, arranged every other position. So, for example, substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 would each be meta to one another.

Wait, no. Because in a six-membered ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 are all meta to each other. For example, 1 is meta to 3, and 3 is meta to 5, but 1 and 5 are actually para to each other (since they are opposite in the ring). Oh wait no, in a six-membered ring, positions 1 and 4 are para, 2 and 5, 3 and 6. So if substituents are at 1, 3, and 5, then 1 and 5 are para, which might complicate things. Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each is meta relative to the others. So maybe the three substituents are in positions 1, 3, and 5, but that would make 1 and 5 para, which isn't meta. So maybe there's a different arrangement. I might have to think again.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has the three substituents in positions such that each is meta relative to the others, but not necessarily 1,3,5. Maybe each substituent is meta to the others, but not necessarily all three on the same meta positions. Hmm, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are each two positions away from each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is in position 1. Then the carbaldehyde is in position 3 (meta to the acid). The cyano group would then be in position 5, which is meta to position 3 but also to position 1, since 1 and 5 are four positions apart, which is the same as two positions in the other direction (since 7 mod 6 is 1). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, in a benzene ring, the distance between positions is the minimal number of steps along the ring. So positions 1 and 3 are meta (separated by one carbon), positions 1 and 5 are also meta? No, because positions 1 and 4 are para. Wait, no. Let me imagine a benzene ring.

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 arranged clockwise. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 3 is opposite to 6 (since 1-2-3-4-5-6). Wait, no. Position 4 is opposite to 1, 5 opposite to 2, 6 opposite to 3. So the meta positions for 1 would be 3 and 5. Because from 1, moving two steps clockwise is 3, and two steps counter-clockwise is 5. So substituents in 3 and 5 are both meta to 1.

So if the carboxylic acid is in 1, the carbaldehyde is in 3 (meta to acid), and the cyano group is in 5 (meta to acid and also meta to carbaldehyde?), but wait, 3 and 5 are two positions apart (from 3, 5 is two steps counter-clockwise, yes). So 3 and 5 are meta to each other as well. So in this arrangement, each substituent is meta to the others. So that works.

Now, the rest of the substituents. The question states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So the carboxylic acid is in position 1. Ortho to 1 would be positions 2 and 6.

So, perhaps position 2 is hydroxyl and 6 is dimethyl amino, or vice versa. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para to position 1 is position 4. So position 4 is methoxy.

Additionally, the question says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are also both ortho to the nitrile group. The nitrile is the cyano group, which is in position 5. So, ortho to 5 would be positions 4 and 6.

Wait, position 5 is between 4 and 6? Let me see: position 5 is next to 4 and 6. Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. So, ortho to 5 would be 4 and 6.

So, the methoxy is at 4, which is ortho to 5 (since 4 is adjacent to 5). So, that's good because the methoxy is ortho to the nitrile. The hydroxyl is at 2, which is adjacent to 1 and 3. Wait, but 2 is ortho to 1, but not ortho to 5. Hmm, but according to the question, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. So hydroxyl must be in a position ortho to 5. So that would mean hydroxyl is either at 4 or 6, but 4 is already methoxy.

Wait, let me re-examine. The substituents ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are hydroxyl and dimethyl amino. So positions 2 and 6. Let's say hydroxyl is at 2, dimethyl amino at 6.

Then, the methoxy is at 4. The nitrile is at 5. Now, the question says the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. So nitrile is at 5. Ortho to 5 is 4 and 6. So, for the hydroxyl to be ortho to 5, it must be at position 4 or 6.

But in our current arrangement, the hydroxyl is at 2, which is not ortho to 5 (since 2 is next to 1 and 3). So that can't be. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I have to adjust the substituents.

Alternative approach: Let me try to assign the positions based on the substituents and their relationships.

Let me decide the numbering. The parent chain is benzoic acid, so the carboxylic acid group is at position 1. So the numbering starts with the carboxylic acid as position 1.

Now, the substituents:

1. Carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 1.

2. Carbaldehyde (CHO) is meta to the COOH, so at position 3.

3. Cyano (CN) is meta to the COOH, so at position 5.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that positions 1,3,5 would be meta to each other, but position 5 is para to position 1 (since 1 and 5 are four positions apart, which is the same as two in the opposite direction). Wait, no, the para position is opposite, which is three positions away. For a six-membered ring, position 1 and 4 are para, 2 and 5, 3 and 6. So, in benzene, each substituent has a para position that's directly opposite.

Wait, so if COOH is at 1, then meta positions are 3 and 5. So 3 and 5 are meta to 1. But the question says that the three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to each other. So, COOH is at 1, CHO is at 3 (meta to 1), and CN is at 5 (meta to 1), which is also meta to CHO (since 3 and 5 are two positions apart). So that works.

Now, the substituents ortho to COOH are hydroxyl and dimethyl amino. So ortho to 1 are positions 2 and 6.

Hydroxyl (OH) and dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) are in 2 and 6. Let's say OH is at 2 and N(CH3)2 at 6.

Then, para to COOH (position 1) is position 4, which is methoxy (OCH3). So position 4 is OCH3.

Now, the question says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile (CN at 5). So, nitrile is at 5. The ortho positions to 5 are 4 and 6.

So, the substituents at 4 and 6 must be either methoxy or hydroxyl.

But we have methoxy at 4, and dimethyl amino at 6. Wait, but hydroxyl is at 2, which is not ortho to 5. So that's a problem. Because according to the question, both methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to CN. So, the hydroxyl must be at either 4 or 6. But position 4 is methoxy, so hydroxyl must be at 6. But in that case, position 6 would have both dimethyl amino and hydroxyl? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I assigned the substituents wrong. Let me try again.

Let me assign:

COOH at 1.

CHO at 3 (meta to COOH).

CN at 5 (meta to COOH and meta to CHO).

Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6): OH and N(CH3)2.

Para to COOH (position 4): OCH3.

Now, the methoxy (position 4) is ortho to CN (5). That's correct because position 4 is adjacent to 5.

The hydroxyl and methoxy must both be ortho to CN. So hydroxyl must be at 6, because 6 is ortho to 5. Because 5 is connected to 4 and 6. So position 6 is adjacent to 5. So, if hydroxyl is at 6, then OCH3 is at 4 (which is also ortho to 5). So, that would satisfy the condition that both OCH3 and OH are ortho to CN.

So, putting it all together:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: ?

Wait, wait. Wait, ortho to COOH is positions 2 and 6. So, if I put OH at 6 and N(CH3)2 at 2, then:

Position 2: N(CH3)2.

Position 6: OH.

But then, the question also says that the methoxy is at position 4, which is para to COOH.

So now, substituents:

1: COOH

2: N(CH3)2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: OH

Now, let's check the ortho and meta relationships.

For COOH (1):

Ortho substituents: 2 (N(CH3)2) and 6 (OH) → correct.

Para: 4 (OCH3) → correct.

For CN (5):

Ortho substituents: 4 (OCH3) and 6 (OH) → correct.

For CHO (3):

Ortho substituents: 2 (N(CH3)2) and 4 (OCH3).

Wait, but the question doesn't specify anything about the substituents relative to the CHO. So that's okay.

So now, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: N(CH3)2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: OH

Now, the IUPAC name should list the substituents in alphabetical order, starting with the lowest possible number. But the numbering is based on the substituents in a certain order.

Wait, in IUPAC nomenclature for benzoic acid derivatives, the numbering starts with the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, the other substituents are numbered in a way that gives the smallest possible numbers, considering the substituents' positions.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are:

COOH (1), CHO (3), CN (5), OCH3 (4), N(CH3)2 (2), OH (6).

Wait, but when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, except for the functional groups which have priority. Wait, the functional groups are listed based on their priority.

Wait, the main chain is the benzoic acid. So the substituents are named in alphabetical order, but with the order of precedence. Wait, the substituents are:

Alphabetically: CN (cyano), CHO (carbaldehyde), COOH (carboxylic acid), dimethylamino, hydroxyl, methoxy.

But in terms of functional group priority, the order of substituents is based on their suffixes. The suffixes order is:

- The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid (-oic acid), so that gets the highest priority.

Then, the substituents are ordered based on their suffixes. The order of suffixes is:

- Aldehyde ( -CHO ) comes before amino groups, but wait, no.

Wait, the order is determined by the suffixes' priority. The general rule is:

The suffixes are ranked as follows (from highest to lowest priority):

1. -oic acid (carboxylic acid)
2. -oate (ester)
3. -ol (alcohol)
4. -amine (amino)
5. -nitrile (cyano)
6. -al (aldehyde)
7. -keto (ketone)
8. etc.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The substituents are named in alphabetical order, but their priority is determined by their functional group.

Wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but any substituent with a higher priority (like -COOH) is named first regardless of position, because it's part of the parent name. For other substituents, their order is based on their alphabetical order, but for some, like -NH2 derivatives, their position affects the numbering.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Numbering starts with the COOH as position 1.

2. The other substituents are numbered based on the lowest possible set of numbers for the substituents. But in this case, the numbering is fixed because the substituents' positions are determined by their relationships.

3. For the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, except for the principal group (COOH, which is part of the parent name). So the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but the order may vary based on substituent suffixes.

Wait, the substituents are:

- cyano (CN) at 5.

- carbaldehyde (CHO) at 3.

- hydroxyl (OH) at 6.

- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) at 2.

- methoxy (OCH3) at 4.

So the substituents (excluding COOH) are: CHO, CN, N(CH3)2, OH, OCH3.

Alphabetical order:

CHO is 'formyl', CN is 'cyano', dimethylamino is 'dimethylamino', hydroxyl is 'hydroxy', methoxy is 'methoxy'.

Wait, the alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order are:

1. Carbaldehyde (CHO): comes first?

Wait, no, the order is based on the substituent's name.

Let me list them:

- Cyano: C.

- Dimethylamino: D.

- Formyl (CHO): F.

- Hydroxyl: H.

- Methoxy: M.

So in alphabetical order: C, D, F, H, M.

So the substituents in the name should be listed in this order.

Wait, but wait, IUPAC rules state that substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but some substituents have higher priority in the order, which affects their position in the name.

Wait, no. The order is based on the substituent's name, regardless of their position on the ring. So, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order.

So the substituents are:

Cyano, Dimethylamino, Formyl, Hydroxyl, Methoxy.

Wait, the substituent names would be:

- 2-cyano (position 5? Wait, no, numbering starts at 1 for COOH. So position 5 is substituent at 5.)

Wait, no, the positions are determined first, then the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So let's list their positions:

CN is at 5.

CHO is at 3.

N(CH3)2 is at 2.

OH is at 6.

OCH3 is at 4.

So when writing the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions.

So the substituents, in alphabetical order, would be:

C (cyano) at 5 → 5-cyano.

D (dimethylamino) at 2 → 2-(dimethylamino).

F (formyl) at 3 → 3-formyl.

H (hydroxy) at 6 →6-hydroxy.

M (methoxy) at 4 →4-methoxy.

Wait, but the hydroxy is at 6, methoxy at 4, and so on.

But when writing the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so:

3-formyl, 5-cyano, 2-(dimethylamino), 4-methoxy, 6-hydroxy.

Wait, but the main group is benzoic acid, so the base name is benzoic acid.

So the full name would be:

[Substituents in alphabetical order] benzoic acid.

So the substituents are arranged as follows:

- 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano,6-hydroxy.

Wait, but when written in order, it's:

2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 4-methoxy,5-cyano,6-hydroxy.

Wait, but wait, the alphabetical order would be cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. So the substituents in order are:

5-cyano, 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 6-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

But wait, the order is based on the substituent's name, not their position. So in the name, they are listed in the order of their names.

So, cyano comes first, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, then methoxy.

Wait, no. Let me think about the actual substituent names:

- Cyano → C

- Dimethylamino → D

- Formyl → F

- Hydroxy → H

- Methoxy → M

So, the order in the name is cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the substituents, in the name, are listed as:

5-cyano, 2-(dimethylamino),3-formyl,6-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Wait, but when writing the substituents, their positions are relative to the COOH group, which is at position 1.

But the name should be: [substituents in alphabetical order] + benzoic acid.

So, substituents in order: cyano (5), dimethylamino (2), formyl (3), hydroxy (6), methoxy (4).

So the name would be 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which matches exactly what we just came up with.

Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Option D:5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So based on our analysis, the correct substituent order would be the substituents in alphabetical order, leading to option D.

Wait, but wait. Another thing to consider: in IUPAC, the numbering is done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. But in this case, the substituents are fixed because of their relative positions.

Wait, but sometimes, the numbering can be adjusted to give the substituents the lower numbers. But in this case, since the COOH is at position 1, and the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions are 2,3,4,5,6, trying to switch the numbering might not help. So the numbering is correct as is.

So the correct name should be option D.


The molecule is a benzoic acid derivative with multiple substituents arranged on the benzene ring. The analysis begins by assigning the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to position 1, as it is the principal functional group. The carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), and other substituents are then positioned based on the given relationships:

1. **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is at position 1.
2. **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** is meta to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 3.
3. **Cyano (-CN)** is also meta to the carboxylic acid and meta to the carbaldehyde, so it is at position 5.
4. **Hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)** are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions 2 and 6.
5. **Methoxy (-OCH₃)** is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 4.
6. The methoxy (-OCH₃) and hydroxyl (-OH) are both ortho to the cyano (-CN), confirming their positions.

The substituents are now assigned as follows:
- Position 1: -COOH
- Position 2: -N(CH₃)₂
- Position 3: -CHO
- Position 4: -OCH₃
- Position 5: -CN
- Position 6: -OH

For the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order (based on their names), excluding the principal group (-COOH, part of the parent name "benzoic acid"). The alphabetical order of the substituents is: cyano (-CN), dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂), formyl (-CHO), hydroxy (-OH), methoxy (-OCH₃).

Thus, the substituents are listed as:
- 5-cyano
- 2-(dimethylamino)
- 3-formyl
- 6-hydroxy
- 4-methoxy

The correct IUPAC name is **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**, which matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
