Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through each part carefully.

Alright, the question is about a series of reactions and then determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups usually relate to the shape of the molecule, so I probably need to figure out what E is first.

Starting with the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. When C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think I should start by identifying the possible compounds involved in each reaction.

Let's look at reaction 3 first because it says that when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Common strong acids include H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc., and weak ones like acetic acid, H3PO4 maybe?

Also, when C reacts with water, it forms A. So perhaps C is a salt, and when it's hydrolyzed, it gives back A (a metal oxide or hydroxide?) plus acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride or something that forms acids when hydrolyzed. Let me think: For example, if C is a nitride like Ca3N2, when it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (a weak acid's conjugate base?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, maybe. But wait, if C is a nitride, it could hydrolyze to produce NH3 and some strong acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include H2O, maybe something like ethanol or methanol, but these are usually from reactions of alcohols. Alternatively, if B is a halogen, like Cl2, and D is something that can react with Cl2 to form a solvent. Wait, another angle: If D is H2O and B is something else? Or perhaps D is O2 and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the first reaction. Solid A reacts with gas B to form product C. The product C is bright red. That's a hint. What compounds are bright red? For example, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Like CuSO4 is blue, but maybe something else. Oh, perhaps it's lead(II,IV) oxide which is red, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro compound, like a nitroso or nitro group.

Wait, another possibility: if B is Cl2, then reacting with A (maybe an alkali metal) could form a chloride. But wait, in reaction 3, when C reacts with water, it gives A and two acids. So perhaps C is an acid salt. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about a reaction where a metal oxide (A) reacts with a gas (like Cl2) to form a chloride and possibly some other product. But how about if solid A is a metal, like copper, and B is Cl2? Then reaction could be 2Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2, but that's not 8 equivalents. Wait, the reaction says 8 equivalents. So maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal with a higher valency. Let me think: if B is O2, then reaction could form a metal oxide. For example, 4Al + 3O2 → 2Al2O3. But 8 equivalents... Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is something like H2S or another gas. Let me think about the other reactions.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E
