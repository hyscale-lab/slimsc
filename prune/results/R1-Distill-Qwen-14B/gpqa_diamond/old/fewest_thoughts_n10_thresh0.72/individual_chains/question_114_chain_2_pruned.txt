Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each reaction. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide like NaCN, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, ketones can react with HCN (or its sources like NaCN) under certain conditions.

But how does that go? Oh, the typical reaction is the addition of HCN to ketones. The mechanism probably involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. So, the ketone would add HCN, giving a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. So butan-2-one would become (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: the starting material is butan-2-one, so the carbonyl is on carbon 2. Adding HCN would put the OH and CN groups on the same carbon, which is carbon 2. So the product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh, that makes sense.

So the reaction is the addition of HCN to the ketone. Now, what conditions are needed for this? I remember that HCN can be added to a ketone using an acid catalyst. So the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes, when using NaCN, it's in a solution with a proton source. NaCN in aqueous solution might provide HCN in the presence of an acid. So if the first reagent is H3O+ (option A or B), that would provide the necessary acidic conditions for the HCN addition.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is treated with reagent B in
