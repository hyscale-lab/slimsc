Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l = 1. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So that means each electron has l1=1 and l2=1, and the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, with the z-component m being -1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z (the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ for both. So, I need to find the probability that when I measure each L_z, I get -ħ for both particles.

Hmm. Wait, orbital angular momentum states are represented by |l, m>. Here, each electron's orbital angular momentum is l=1. The total angular momentum is L = L1 + L2. So the state given is a coupled state, combining both electrons' angular momenta.

But wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l=1, and their sum gives total l=2, m=-1.

Now, how are the states |l1, l2, l, m> related to the product states of individual particles? The coupled states are linear combinations of the product states. So, the given state is a specific linear combination of the product states |l1, m1>|l2, m2>, where m1 + m2 = m_total, which is -1 in this case.

Wait, but each particle's state can be in any m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. So possible pairs are (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1) if l1 and l2 are 1, but wait, wait, each electron's m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the given state is for total l=2 and m=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So I think the state can be written as a sum of |1, m1> ⊗
