Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complex. Well, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. Let me think about how that works.

Wait, right! The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for this molecule, which is an alkene with multiple substituents, I'll need to figure out all the bonds broken and formed.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom. So for carbon, which is tetravalent, that means breaking four C bonds? Wait, no, wait. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy needed to convert an element into its atoms in the gas phase. For carbon, which is solid in its standard state, this would mean breaking all the bonds in the graphite structure. But maybe I don't need to worry about that because the bond energies are given for the specific bonds.

The bond energies given are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but what about the energy for C≡C bonds? Oh, the given data doesn't have that, so maybe the molecule doesn't have any triple bonds. Looking at the structure, I see C=C double bonds but no triple bonds, so that's fine.

So, the approach is to calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (elements) and subtract the energy released when forming the bonds in the product (the compound).

Wait, no, wait. The formula is: 

ΔHf° = Σ [Bond energies of reactants] - Σ [Bond energies of products]

Wait, no, wait. The correct formula is the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. So it's the energy required to break the bonds in the elements minus the energy released when the product's bonds
