Okay, so I've got this question here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, what do I remember about Grubbs catalyst? Oh right, it's used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means breaking and reforming double bonds, right? So the catalyst will cause the alkene to undergo some kind of rearrangement.

The molecule given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of the R and S configurations around the stereogenic center. So the starting material has a double bond at position 1, and a methyl group on carbon 3.

Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means five carbons with a double bond between C1 and C2. So 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on C3. The structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. But wait, since it's 3-methyl, maybe I should number it again. Oh right, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait no, wait
