Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule moves from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the molecule is in its ground vibrational state and the lowest rotational state.

The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed. The photon's energy should cause the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state. Wait, what's the next lowest state? Well, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. The next state might involve either a vibrational or rotational change. But I think the question is referring to the next state in terms of overall energy, not necessarily just rotation or vibration.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both. The total energy E is the sum of rotational energy and vibrational energy. The fundamental state is usually the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1, depending on the molecule). But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1
