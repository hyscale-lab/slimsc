Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state given by 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx, up to one decimal place.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to get when measuring that observable on a large number of identically prepared systems. The formula I vaguely recall is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So, the operator here is O = 10σz +5σx. To find the expectation value, I think I can break this into two parts: compute the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

Wait, but I should probably compute them separately and then combine. Let me think.

First, the σz operator. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that should simplify things. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively, I think. So, for σz, the expectation value would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, yes. The general approach is that for a state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is |a|² * (+1) + |b|² * (-1). Because |a|² is the probability of measuring spin-up, which gives +1, and |b|² is the probability for spin-down, giving -1.

So, let me compute that. The state given is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's compute |a|² and |b|². The coefficients are a=0.5, so |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|² is (3/4) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4.

So, the expectation of σz, ⟨σz⟩, is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

But wait, the operator here is 10σz, so the expectation value of that part is 10 * ⟨σz⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) = -5.0.

Now, the second part is 5σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. I remember that σx has eigenstates that are different from |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ because it's a spin-x observable. The eigenstates of σ
