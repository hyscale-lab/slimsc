Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm supposed to figure out which compound C9H11NO2 corresponds to, based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by going through each piece of data step by step.

First, looking at the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 -m -x -y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2 (from O), y=1 (from N). Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, or two rings and a double bond, or one ring and two double bonds, etc. But since the molecule is likely to have a benzene ring (due to the NMR data), that accounts for one ring (which is three degrees, wait no—benzene is three double bonds, so each double bond is a degree. Wait, each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene is three double bonds, so three degrees. Oh wait, wait, wait. Degree of unsaturation for benzene is 4? Let me think again. Degree of unsaturation is each ring or each double bond. Benzene has three double bonds and a ring, but wait, no. The formula is each ring or each double bond counts as one. So benzene has three double bonds → 3 degrees. Wait, no, wait: the degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Or wait, another way: each ring or pi bond is one degree. So benzene has three double bonds (so three degrees) and one ring (so that's four degrees in total?) No, wait, benzene has three double bonds, but it's a ring. Wait, no, wait. Let me recount. Benzene has a ring structure with three double bonds. Each double bond is one degree, but the ring itself is another. No, that's not right. I think the ring is considered a single degree, plus each double bond. So benzene has three double bonds inside a ring. So the ring itself is one degree, each double bond another. So 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) = 4 degrees. But wait, that can't be because the formula gives 3 degrees. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me recalculate.

Wait, maybe the calculation is simpler. For C9H11NO2, the degrees of unsaturation are (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 → (20-14)/2=3. So three degrees. So perhaps a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees: because C6H6 has 4 degrees? Wait that's conflicting. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should just proceed and not get stuck on this.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium absorption around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H or O-H stretches. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong band, which is likely a carbonyl (C=O) group. So that suggests an amide, formamide, or maybe a ketone, but considering the molecular formula, more likely an amide or formamide.

The 1H NMR data has the following peaks:

1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H) → this is likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so probably a CH2CH3 where the CH2 is next to another CH2 (like in OCH2CH3, where the ethyl is OCH2CH3).
