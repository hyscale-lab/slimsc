Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says a chemist found an unnamed white solid and is trying to identify it using spectral data. The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D. I need to look at the provided spectral information and match it to one of these options.

First, let me list out the given data:

Mass Spectrometry:
- Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)
- A peak at m/z = 158 (32%)

IR:
- Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1
- Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1

1H NMR:
- 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)
- 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm, okay. So I need to analyze each of these to figure out what's going on.

Starting with the Mass Spec. The molecular ion is at 156. The other peak at 158 is at 32%, which is a small fragment. Wait, molecular ion plus 2? That might indicate the presence of something like a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has an atomic weight of approximately 35 and 37. So if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at m/z = molecular weight (M) and one at M+2. Let's calculate the possible M.

Assuming the molecular ion is M (at 156), but the peak at 158 is at 32%. That's about 32% of the intensity. The intensity ratio between M and M+2 can help determine if Cl is present. For a molecule with one Cl, the ratio is typically around 3:1 (since Cl has two isotopes, about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37). So the M+2 peak should be about a quarter of the M peak. Here, 32% is roughly a third. Hmm, maybe that's close enough considering possible approximations. So this suggests the molecule has one Cl atom.

So the molecular weight is around 156. Let me think about the possible options.

Options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid

C) Phenyl chloroformate

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Let me calculate the molecular weights for each.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl on carbon 3, OH on 2, and aldehyde on 1. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2.

Molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total = 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. Hmm, close to 156. But the molecular ion is 156, so maybe it's a rounding thing. Or perhaps the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, so exact mass is 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156, which is lower. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is different.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl on 4, and COOH on the benzene. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A. So same molecular weight of 156.5.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2ClC=O? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is ClCO-O-C6H5? Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check. Chloroformate is O=C(OCl)Cl? No, wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So for phenyl chloroformate, it's Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2.

Same as options A and B, so molecular weight is 156.5. So same as before.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl on 2, COOH on 1. So formula is C7H5ClO2. Again, same as others. So same molecular weight.

So all options have the same molecular formula except perhaps their substitution patterns. Hmm. So the molecular ion is 156. So maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, but perhaps one of the options has a different structure.

Wait, but why is there a peak at m/z 158? For a molecule with Cl, the M peak would be at 156 (assuming Cl is 35), but M+2 would be 37 Cl, so 156 + 2 = 158. The intensity would be about 25% of M (since Cl is about 3:1). But the M+2 peak is 32%, which is higher than 25%. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the molecular formula has more Cl atoms? Let's check each option.

Wait, all options have one Cl. So the M+2 should be about 25%
