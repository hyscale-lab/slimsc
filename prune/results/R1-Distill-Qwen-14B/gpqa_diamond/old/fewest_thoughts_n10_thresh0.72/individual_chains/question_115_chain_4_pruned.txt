Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and in this case, it's two photons. The interesting part is that both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, first, let me jot down what I know. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis, from the left, with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. So, they're approaching each other on the same line.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right. So gamma for electron is 4, and for positron, it's 2. I remember that gamma is equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need the actual velocities here. Maybe it's more about the momenta and energies.

Since they annihilate into two photons, I should think about conservation laws. Specifically, conservation of energy and momentum. Because photons have momentum and energy, but no mass. And since the system before collision should have equal energy and momentum to the system after.

Wait, but wait. Electrons and positrons have rest mass, but when they annihilate, the total energy goes into the photons. So, the total energy before collision must equal the total energy after. Similarly, the momentum before must equal the momentum after.

Let me think about the momenta. The electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left along the horizontal axis). The positron is moving to the left (since it's from the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since momentum is a vector, direction matters. Let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-direction, and the positron along the negative.

Wait, but Lorentz factor relates to the total energy. The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV. So each has rest mass energy, and their total energy is
