Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about determining which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is important for various properties like their spectroscopic behavior and reactions. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll need to think this through.

The question lists four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[...], and triphenyleno[...]... I think I need to analyze each one for their symmetry elements.

First, let me recall what C3h symmetry means. Oh right, C3h is a type of point group. Point groups describe the symmetry of a molecule, and C3h implies that the molecule has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The combination of these makes the molecule have certain symmetry elements.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that C3h is part of the group known as the dihedral groups. Wait no, dihedral groups are for regular polygons. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think C3h has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So any plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis and passes through a certain part of the molecule.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. The name suggests a tricyclic structure with three furan rings attached to a central structure. If I imagine the structure, perhaps it's something like three benzene-like rings connected in a way that creates symmetry. Wait, triphenylene has three phenyl groups connected in a triangular fashion, right? So if this molecule has three phenyl groups attached to a central structure, maybe it has a threefold axis. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the central part, it might have C3 symmetry. But I also need to consider any mirror planes.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Similar structure but perhaps with a different arrangement. The benzo suggests a benzene ring fused with something. The trifuran part is three furan rings. The numbering might indicate how they're fused. Maybe this one has a different symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a threefold rotation, perhaps it's C3 symmetric.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. The structure of triisopropyl borate is B(OCH(CH2CH3)2)3. So the boron is at the center, and three isopropyl groups are attached. Isopropyl groups are symmetrical themselves. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar structure around boron. That might give it a C3 axis because all three substituents are the same. But wait, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the boron is in the center and the groups are arranged symmetrically, then any plane passing through boron and a plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would be a mirror plane. So maybe triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Wait, let me think. Quinuclidine has a bridge with three bridges, each of two carbons. Its structure is symmetric, but what kind of symmetry? It's a cage compound. I think quinuclidine has a C3 axis. Because looking from above, if you rotate it 120 degrees, the structure would look the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different point group like D3h or something else.

Wait, let's think about each point group. For C3h, the molecule must have a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So let's consider each option:

- Triisopropyl borate: The molecule is trigonal planar around boron. So the B is at the center, and three isopropyl groups are arranged around it. So any rotation of 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. That gives the C3 part. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, a horizontal plane perpendicular to the C3 axis (like the plane containing the boron and the mirror plane) would be a mirror plane. So yes, it would have σh. Thus, it fits C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I'm thinking it's a bridged structure. If you rotate it 120 degrees around an axis, does it look the same? Let's see, the molecule has three bridges. If the axis goes through the bridgehead carbons, rotating would bring each bridge into the position of another. So yes, it has a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. If a plane cuts through the center and reflects the molecule, would it be a mirror plane? Alternatively, quinuclidine's structure is such that it's symmetric in a way that perhaps the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal. So maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, making it not C3h but perhaps another group like C3v.

Benzo[...]: The molecule has three substituents (furan rings) attached to a central structure. If the substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion, like triphenylene, then it would have a C3 axis. But whether it has a horizontal mirror plane depends on the arrangement. Alternatively, if the substituents are all in the same plane but arranged symmetrically, perhaps not. Wait, the hexaone suggests ketone groups. So the structure might have multiple ketones, which are in specific positions, perhaps leading to a certain symmetry.

Wait, putting it all together, triisopropyl borate (option C) seems to have C3h symmetry because it has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central atom, which gives a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So option C would be the correct answer.

Wait, but looking again, the options are labeled A to D, with C being triisopropyl borate. So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry elements of each option. **C₃h** symmetry implies the presence of a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Let us evaluate each option:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule has a tricyclic structure with three phenyl groups attached to a central structure. While the phenyl groups are symmetrically arranged, the molecule does not have a clear horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a benzene ring fused with three furan rings. The arrangement of the substituents does not allow for a threefold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
The structure of triisopropyl borate features a boron atom at the center, with three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around it. This arrangement provides a threefold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to the C₃ axis. Thus, it satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridged structure. It has a threefold rotation axis (C₃), but it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Instead, it has vertical mirror planes, which places it in a different symmetry group (e.g., **C₃v**) rather than **C₃h**.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only **triisopropyl borate** exhibits **C₃h** symmetry due to its threefold rotation axis and horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
