Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. From what I remember, a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. So, each compound must be assessed for chirality.

Let's go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, so this is a double bond. The configuration is Z. Double bonds can sometimes lead to geometric isomerism, but does that mean the compound is chiral? I think geometric isomerism (like E/Z) isn't the same as being chiral. For a compound to be chiral, it needs a chiral center, which is a carbon attached to four different groups. Let's look at the structure. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But wait, with chloro on carbon 1 and methyl on carbon 2. So the structure is CHCl2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure would be Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be substituting a Cl on the first carbon (CH2Cl). But wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl with two substituents on C1? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, because it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro would be on C1, which is part of the double bond. So the structure would be Cl attached
