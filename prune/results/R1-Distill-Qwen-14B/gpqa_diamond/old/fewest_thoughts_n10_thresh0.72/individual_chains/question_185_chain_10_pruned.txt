Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Let me see what the problem says.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = εσ·n. Hmm, σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is an arbitrary unit vector. ε is an energy constant. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product σ·n would mean multiplying each Pauli matrix by the corresponding component of n and summing them up.

Wait, but what's the structure of σ·n? Oh right, it's like n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So this is a 2x2 matrix because each σ is 2x2. Now, the eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the equation det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, for a spin-½ system, maybe there's a simpler way to find the eigenvalues without calculating the determinant.

I remember that for a spin system, the spin matrices have eigenvalues related to their magnitude. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. But when they're combined into a dot product with a unit vector, what happens?

Wait, another approach: the operator σ·n is a vector in the Bloch sphere direction, and such an operator has eigenvalues dependent on the magnitude of the vector. But wait, the σ matrices are dimensionless, but in our case, the entire operator is multiplied by ε. Let me think about the structure of the Hamiltonian.

Each Pauli matrix is Hermitian and traceless. So the sum n·σ is also Hermitian and traceless, which means its eigenvalues should be symmetric around zero. So for any unit vector n, the eigenvalues of σ·n would be ±1, right? Because the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1, but when combined in a particular direction, the maximum eigenvalue would be 1, and the minimum -1.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it as a 2x2 matrix. Let's say that H = σ·n, without the ε factor for a moment. What are the eigenvalues of σ·n?

The trace of σ·n would be zero because each Pauli
