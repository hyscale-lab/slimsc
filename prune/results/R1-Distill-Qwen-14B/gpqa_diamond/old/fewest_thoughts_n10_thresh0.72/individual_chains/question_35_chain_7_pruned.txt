Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to parse it step by step.

The question says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix represented as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, right, c is h/(4π), and S is a matrix given with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I guess S is a Pauli matrix or something similar. 

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question isn't asking me to compute them directly; it's asking which statement is correct regarding the process. So the options are A, B, C, D.

Let me first think about what the matrix Ay looks like. Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), let's compute that matrix.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying by c, Ay becomes:
[ 0  -i * (h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0 ]

Which simplifies to:
Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, but each element is multiplied by c. So yeah, that's the matrix.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

So the matrix Ay - a I is:
[ -a      (-i c) ]
[ (i c)   -a    ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c) )(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, what's (-i c)(i c)? Let me compute that. (-i)(i)= -i² = -(-1) = 1. So it's (1) multiplied by c².

But wait, in the determinant, it's ( (-i c) * (i c) ) which is (-i * i) c². (-i)(i) is -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (1 * c²) = 0.

So the equation is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c²
