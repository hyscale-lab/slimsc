Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the high-yield synthesis of a specific compound, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I need to think about the target molecule. Let me draw its structure. The main part is a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine and a nitro group. Looking at the positions: the bromine is at position 3, and the nitro is at position 5. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering. Let me imagine benzene with substituents. So, positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other. Wait, no, wait: 3 and 5 are actually para to each other because in a six-membered ring, positions 1, 3, 5 are alternating. So 3 and 5 are across from each other, which would be para. Oh wait, no, 1,2,3,4,5,6: 3 and 5 are two positions apart, so they are meta. Wait, no. Let me think again. If you have substituents in positions 3 and 5 of benzene, that's meta to each other. Because 3 and 5 are two positions away. So the nitro is at 5, bromo at 3, and the ketone is attached at position 1, I think. Wait, the ethanone is the substituent; the structure is phenyl group attached to a ketone, so the ketone is a substituent on the benzene.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (ethan-1-one, which is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, so it's an acetyl group?), the bromine in the 3 position, and the nitro group in the 5 position.

Wait, actually, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to a 1-ketone. So it's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1. Or wait, no. Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring would be at positions 3 and 5 for Br and NO2, and the ketone is at position 1. So the benzene has three substituents: Br at 3, NO2 at 5, and the ketone at 1. So that makes them meta to each other. Wait, but if the ketone is at 1, then the Br is at 3 (which is meta to 1), and the NO2 is at 5, which is ortho to 3 and para to 1. Wait, that can't be right. Let me get this straight.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. So positions 1,3,5 are all substituted. So the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. So that's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is attached to the phenyl group at position 1, and on that same benzene ring are Br at 3 and NO2 at 5.

So I need to plan how to get these substituents in the correct positions.

The starting material is benzene, which has no substituents. So I need to add three groups: the acetyl (from ethanone), Br, and NO2. The key is to figure out the order of adding these groups to get them in the correct positions.

But wait, benzene is symmetric, so when adding substituents, the positions are determined by the directing effects of each substituent.

Nitro groups are meta directors. Acetyl groups (as ketones) are also meta directors because they are electron-withdrawing. Bromine is an ortho/para director but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (being more electronegative than hydrogen). So the order in which you add substituents will determine where the next group goes.

Wait, but the problem is that when adding substituents, each new group is directed by the existing substituents on the ring. So the order of substitution matters a lot.

Let me think about the target molecule: substituents at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So positions 1,3,5 are all substituted. So the benzene ring has three substituents, each separated by one position (so each is adjacent to the next). Wait, no, 1,3,5 are all on the same ring, each two positions apart. So it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

So how can I get these substituents in the correct positions?

One approach is to first add the nitro group, then the bromine, then the acetyl. Alternatively, perhaps adding the acetyl first, then nitro and bromine. Or another sequence.

Wait, but each step affects where the next substituent goes.

Let me try to outline possible steps.

Option 1: Add nitro first, then bromine, then acetyl.

Nitro is a meta director. So if I nitrate benzene, the nitro group goes in position 1. Then, when I add bromine, it can go either ortho or para to the nitro group. Wait, no: nitro is meta directing. So when adding Br, which is an ortho/para director? Wait, no. Wait, Br is an ortho/para director but is deactivating. So when adding Br to a nitro-substituted benzene, the nitro group directs incoming groups to its meta positions. Wait, no. Wait, nitro group is a meta director, so the next substituent would go meta to it, but wait, if I have a nitro group, and then add Br, where does Br go?

Wait, perhaps I should think this through more carefully.

Let me consider each step:

1. Start with benzene.

2. First nitration: the nitro group will be added. Benzene is highly activated, so nitration under HNO3 and H2SO4 will add nitro at a single position (since benzene is symmetric). So after nitration, we have nitrobenzene.

3. Next, adding bromine. Since nitro is a meta director, the bromine will enter at the meta position relative to nitro. So in nitrobenzene, adding Br2 with FeBr3 will add Br at the meta position. So now, the ring has nitro at position 1, Br at position 3.

4. Then adding the acetyl group. Now, the ring has two substituents: nitro (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director, but it's deactivating). So when adding the acetyl group, which is an electrophilic substitution, the incoming group will be directed by the substituents.

But in this case, the substituents are at positions 1 (nitro) and 3 (Br). So the next substituent (acetyl) must go where? The directing effects of nitro and Br will influence where the acetyl attaches.

Wait, nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Br is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. So which group is more influential here? The nitro group is more deactivating than Br, so the acetyl will be directed more by the nitro group.

So the acetyl group would likely go meta to the nitro group, which would be position 5. Wait, but in nitrobenzene with Br at 3, the meta position to nitro is position 5? Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Nitro at position 1. Then, positions 2,3,4,5,6. So meta to nitro (1) is position 4. Wait, no. Wait, meta positions are three positions away. So for position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. Wait, wait, in benzene, each position has two meta positions. For example, position 1's meta positions are 3 and 5. Wait, no. Wait, in a six-membered ring, each position has two ortho (adjacent), two meta (two positions away), and one para (directly opposite). Wait, but for six-membered ring, each position has two ortho, two meta, and one para. So position 1 has ortho at 2 and 6, meta at 3 and 5, and para at 4.

So, if nitro is at 1, then meta positions are 3 and 5. But if we have Br at 3, then the available meta positions are 5. Because if you add a substituent, it's directed to the available positions, considering the existing substituents.

Wait, this might get complicated. Let me think: after nitro at 1 and Br at 3, where would the acetyl go?

The acetyl would be directed by the nitro group, which is meta. So the possible positions are 4 and 6, but wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, nitro group is at 1, so the meta positions are 3 and 5. But position 3 is already taken by Br. So the acetyl would have to go to position 5, which is the other meta position available relative to nitro.

So after adding acetyl, the nitro is at 1, Br at 3, acetyl at 5. But wait, the target has acetyl (ethanone) at 1, which is the same as nitro? No, no, the target has the ethanone at position 1, nitro at 5, and Br at 3.

Wait, so perhaps the order of substitution needs to be different.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the acetyl group, then nitro, then Br. Let me think.

1. Benzene â†’ Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation, giving acetophenone (phenyl ketone). So after step 1, we have acetophenone: phenyl group with acetyl at position 1.

2. Next, nitration. Acetophenone's acetyl group is a meta director. So nitration would add nitro group at the meta position relative to acetyl, which would be position 3 or 5. But wait, after Friedel-Crafts, which position is meta? Let's think: acetophenone has acetyl at position 1. The meta positions are 3 and 5. So nitration could add nitro at 3 or 5.

Wait, but the target has nitro at 5. So perhaps nitration would add nitro at 5 (meta to acetyl at 1). But wait, nitration under what conditions? Nitration is a strong nitrating mixture. So after acetyl, adding nitro at 5.

3. Then, adding Br. Now, the substituents are acetyl at 1 and nitro at 5. So the next substitution is adding Br. The existing groups are acetyl (meta) and nitro (meta). Acetyl is a meta director, nitro is also a meta director. So where would Br go?

Wait, the ring now has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 5. So when adding Br, the directing would be influenced by both.

The acetyl group is at 1, so the meta positions are 3 and 5. Nitro is at 5, so its meta positions are 1 and 3. So the available positions would be 2,4,6.

Wait, but wait. The ring has substituents at 1 and 5. So the possible positions for bromine are 2,3,4,6. Let me think about the directors.

The acetyl is a meta director, so it would direct to positions 3 and 5. Nitro is a meta director, so it would direct to positions 1 and 3. So the overlapping meta positions are 3.

So the Br would go to position 3, which is meta to both acetyl (1) and nitro (5). So the substituents would be at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). That's the target structure.

Wait, that's correct. So the sequence would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the acetyl group.

2. Nitration to add nitro group at 5 (meta to acetyl).

3. Bromination to add Br at 3 (meta to both acetyl and nitro).

So the steps would be: acylation, nitration, bromination.

But looking at the options, do any of them follow this sequence?

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3; ii) Br2/FeBr3; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; etc. So the order is acylation, bromination, nitration. Hmm, that doesn't match our desired order.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3; iii) CH3COCl; etc. So bromination first, then nitration, then acylation. No, that doesn't fit.

Option C: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl; iv) Br2/FeBr3; etc. So nitration first, then something (Fe/HCl must be a reduction, like of nitro to amine?), then acylation, then bromination. So let me see.

Option D: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2; vi) CH3COCl; vii) HNO3. So again, nitration, reduction, diazotization, H3PO2 (which is for what?), then Br2, then acylation, then another nitration. Not sure.

Wait, let's go back. The sequence I thought of is acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Step iii is CH3COCl/AlCl3, which is acylation.

So let's see the steps in option C: i) HNO3 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), iii) CH3COCl (acylation), iv) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), etc. Wait, but if we do nitration first, then reduction, that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I need to think again. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Steps: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration, iv) Fe/HCl... Then what? Hmm, not sure. Let me see the full option.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 â†’ acylation â†’ acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 â†’ bromination. Where? Acetophenone's acetyl is meta director, so Br would go meta to acetyl, which is position 3 or 5. So Br would add to position 3.

Then iii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration. Now, acetophenone has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. So nitration would occur where? The directors are acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para). So the acetyl is at 1, Br at 3. So nitration would be directed to ortho or para to Br, but also meta to acetyl.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think: with substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br), where would the nitration occur?

Br is an ortho/para director. So possible positions for nitration are 2,4,6 (ortho and para to Br). Also, acetyl directs to 3 and 5. So looking for a position that is ortho/para to Br and meta to acetyl.

Br is at 3. Ortho positions are 2 and 4. Para is 6. So nitration could go to 2,4,6, but also must be meta to acetyl.

Acetyl is at 1, so meta positions are 3 and 5. So, the possible positions for nitration are 5 (meta to acetyl) and any ortho/para to Br.

Wait, but 5 is meta to acetyl, but what's its relation to Br at 3? Position 5 is two positions away from Br (3 to 4 to 5), so that's meta to Br as well. Or is it para? No, 3 and 5 are separated by two positions (4), so they're meta.

So nitration would be directed to position 5, which is meta to acetyl and meta to Br. So in option A, after steps i, ii, iii, we'd have acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. That's the target! But wait, in option A, after step iii, nitration is done, but then there are more steps. Let me check what the full sequence in option A is.

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration, iv) Fe/HCl; then v) nitration again, vi) NaNO2, vii) H3PO2. Oh, this seems to have more steps than needed. Because the target has three substituents: acetyl, Br, nitro. So after steps i, ii, iii of option A, we would have all three substituents. Then why are there more steps done? That might lead to further reactions, perhaps not needed. So option A seems to have an extra nitration step (v), which would add another nitro group, which would not be desired. So that's probably incorrect.

So option A can't be correct because it adds an extra nitration step, leading to more substituents.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3, then nitration, then acylation, etc. So first bromination of benzene, which would add Br in any position. Then nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to Br. Then acylation would add acetyl.

But let's think where each substituent would end up.

1. Benzene â†’ bromination â†’ bromobenzene. Br is at position 1.

2. Nitration: Br is ortho/para director. So nitro could be added in ortho or para. Let's say it adds para, so nitro is at 4.

3. Aclation: nitro is a meta director, Br is ortho/para. So acetyl would be directed to a position meta to nitro and ortho/para to Br. Hmm.

Wait, with substituents at 1 (Br) and 4 (NO2), where would acetyl go?

Br is at 1, directing ortho (2) and para (4). Nitro at 4, directing meta (1,3,5). So acetyl can go to position 3 (meta to nitro and ortho to Br?), or maybe 5. Let me see: position 3 is ortho to Br (since Br is at 1, 2 and 6 are ortho; 3 is meta to Br, so it's not ortho). Hmm, perhaps position 5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe this option doesn't give the correct substituent positions.

Option C: Steps i) HNO3 â†’ nitro group added to benzene. So nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl: this is likely a reduction step, turning nitro group into amine. So nitrobenzene â†’ aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3: acylation of the amine? Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation won't work on aniline because amine is a strong activating group, but more importantly, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, but aniline has an NH2 group, which is strongly activating but can't undergo Friedel-Crafts because the acylium ion would attack the ring, but in the presence of NH2, which is ortho/para directing, but also, the NH2 group is a strong activating group. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation require the substrate to be activated (like in benzene, toluene, etc.), and deactivated rings (like nitro) don't undergo Friedel-Crafts. But after reduction, the ring is activated again (aniline is strongly activating).

Wait, but acylation of aniline via Friedel-Crafts would not work because the acylium ion would react with the NH2 group, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylation here is through an electrophilic substitution, but aniline is too activating, leading to multiple substitutions.

Wait, perhaps the order in option C is not feasible. Let me see:

After nitration (i), we have nitrobenzene. Then, step ii) Fe/HCl: this is likely a reduction. Fe/HCl is used for reduction of nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene becomes aniline.

Then step iii is acylation: CH3COCl/AlCl3. But aniline is a very activating group, so Friedel-Crafts acylation is possible. But wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation requires that the ring is activated towards electrophilic substitution, which aniline provides. So the acylation would occur, but where?

Aniline has NH2 at position 1. The acylation would be directed to ortho and para positions relative to NH2. But wait, the acylation would add an acetyl group, which is a meta director. But in this case, the NH2 is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So the acetyl would be added at ortho or para to the NH2 group.

But wait, the NH2 is at position 1. So acetylation would occur at 2 (ortho), 4 (para), or 6 (another ortho). So the acetyl would be at, say, position 4.

Then step iv is Br2/FeBr3: bromination. The substituents are NH2 at 1, acetyl at 4. NH2 is ortho/para director, and acetyl is meta.

So bromine would come into a position that's ortho/para to NH2 and meta to acetyl.

NH2 is at 1; ortho positions are 2 and 6, para is 4. Acetyl is at 4, which is a meta director, so meta to acetyl (at 4) would be positions 1, 3, and 5.

But position 1 is already taken by NH2. So possible positions for Br are 3 or 5, which are meta to acetyl and also ortho to NH2 (position 1). So Br would go to position 3 or 5.

Wait, but if Br is added to position 3, it's ortho to NH2 (position 1 and 2 are ortho; 3 is meta to NH2, no. Wait, position 1 is NH2, so 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is para.

So if Br is added, it's directed by both NH2 and acetyl.

NH2 directs to 2,6 (ortho) and 4 (para). Acetyl directs to 1,3,5 (meta). But 1 is taken. So the Br would prefer positions that are both ortho to NH2 and meta to acetyl.

But the ortho positions to NH2 are 2 and 6, which are not meta to acetyl (since acetyl is at 4, meta to acetyl would be 1,3,5). So 2 and 6 are not meta to acetyl. So perhaps the Br doesn't go in the ortho positions. Alternatively, maybe the para position (4) is already taken by acetyl. So Br would go to position 3 or 5, which are meta to acetyl and meta to NH2.

Wait, but if NH2 is at 1, Br at 3 is meta to NH2, but is that possible? Because NH2 is ortho/para director. So the Br would be at 3, which is meta to NH2. But since NH2 is a strong activator, but Br is an electron-withdrawing group, perhaps it's more likely that the Br adds to the position that's directed by the strongest director.

In this case, NH2 is a stronger activating group than the acetyl (which is deactivating). So Br would be directed to ortho or para to NH2. So 2,4,6.

But 4 is taken by acetyl, so Br would go to 2 or 6. But those are ortho to NH2 (1).

Wait, but if Br is added to position 2, there's the acetyl at 4. So position 2 is ortho to NH2 and meta to acetyl (since acetyl is at 4, meta would be 1,3,5; 2 is not in this list). So perhaps Br would go to position 5, which is meta to acetyl and para to NH2? Wait, NH2 is at 1, para is 4 (which is taken by acetyl), so Br can't go there. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe option C doesn't lead to the correct substituent positions.

Option D: i) HNO3 â†’ nitration, nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction of nitro to amine. So we have NH2 at 1.

iii) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization; this is typically done under cold (0-5Â°C) conditions and forms a diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 â†’ this is used for the Sandmeyer reaction, perhaps to introduce a halide. Wait, but H3PO2 is used for the Stannous chloride reduction, maybe for introducing Br or Cl. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used as a reducing agent, but in this context, perhaps it's used to replace the diazonium group with a Br.

Wait, the steps in option D are:

i) nitration â†’ nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction to aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization (makes benzene diazonium chloride).

iv) H3PO2 â†’ perhaps this is a displacement reaction to replace the diazonium group with Br.

Wait, but that would add Br at the position where the diazonium was, which was where the NH2 was (position 1).

So after step iv, we would have Br at position 1.

Then step v: Br2/FeBr3 â†’ but wait, the ring now has Br at 1. So bromination would add another Br, but where? Br is ortho/para director, so would add at 2,4,6.

But then step vi: CH3COCl/AlCl3 â†’ acylation. So adding acetyl.

But I'm not sure if this sequence leads to the correct substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option D are nitration, reduction, diazotization, and then a substitution, then bromination, then acylation, then another nitration.

This seems complicated and may not lead to the desired product.

Wait, let me think again. The correct sequence I thought earlier was acylation, nitration, bromination. So looking at the options:

Which option has acylation first, followed by nitration, then bromination?

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So after acylation and bromination, then nitration would add at position 5, which is correct. But then option A has more steps. Let me think.

In option A:

i) acylation â†’ acetophenone (acetyl at 1).

ii) bromination â†’ Br at 3 (meta to acetyl).

iii) nitration â†’ nitro at 5 (meta to acetyl and meta to Br).

So after steps i, ii, iii, the substituents are 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro), which is the target. But option A has more steps: iv) Fe/HCl, v) HNO3, vi) NaNO2, vii) H3PO2.

So steps iv to vii would do what? Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. HNO3 is nitration. NaNO2 is diazotization. H3PO2 is for some substitution, perhaps.

But in our target, we don't need any more substituents. So these additional steps would add more groups, which is not desired. So option A isn't correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitration, bromination, then acylation. But I thought that would not give the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). So, perhaps the acetyl is added last.

So could the correct order be nitration, bromination, then acylation?

Let's see:

1. Benzene â†’ nitration â†’ nitro at 1.

2. Bromination: nitro is meta director, so Br at 3 or 5. Let's say Br at 3.

3. Aclation: Now, benzene has nitro at 1 and Br at 3. Where would the acetyl go?

Nitro is a meta director, Br is ortho/para. So the acetyl would be directed to a position that's meta to nitro, which is 3 and 5, but 3 is taken by Br. So acetyl would go to 5.

But the target has nitro at 5 and acetyl at 1. So this doesn't fit. So this sequence would lead to nitro at 1, Br at 3, acetyl at 5.

Which is different from the target.

So that's not correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the correct order is nitration, acylation, bromination.

So:

1. Benzene â†’ nitration â†’ nitro at 1.

2. Aclation: nitro is meta director, so acetyl at 3 or 5.

Suppose acetyl at 3.

3. Bromination: benzene has nitro at 1 and acetyl at 3. Where would Br go?

Nitro is meta director (positions 3 and 5), acetyl is meta director (positions 1 and 5).

So Br would be directed to position 5 (meta to both). So substituents would be nitro at 1, acetyl at 3, Br at 5. Which is 1,3,5 positions. But the target is acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So this arrangement isn't the same as the target. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is bromination, nitration, then acylation.

So:

1. Benzene â†’ bromination â†’ Br at 1.

2. Nitration: Br is ortho/para director. So nitro would go to 2,4, or 6.

Suppose nitro at 4 (para to Br).

3. Aclation: Br is ortho/para (positions 2,6), nitro is meta (positions 1,3,5).

So the acetyl would be directed to a position that's ortho/para to Br (2,6) and meta to nitro (1,3,5).

So possible positions are 3: which is meta to nitro (4) and ortho to Br (1's para is 4, ortho is 2 and 6). Wait, 3 is meta to nitro at 4, and not ortho to Br (which is at 1). So 3 isn't ortho to Br.

Alternatively, could acetyl go to 5?

Nitro is at 4. Meta positions are 1,3,5. But Br is at 1. So 5 is meta to nitro and ortho to Br? Let me see: Br is at 1, 5 is two positions away. So 5 is meta to Br.

Wait, but acetyl would be directed by the substituents. Br is ortho/para, so directs to 2,6. Nitro is meta, so directs to 1,3,5.

So the acetyl would have to go to a position that is ortho/para to Br and meta to nitro.

Looking at positions 2,6 (ortho to Br) and 1,3,5 (meta to nitro). So the only overlapping position is none. Because 2 and 6 are not in 1,3,5. So perhaps this approach doesn't work either.

Hmm, this is getting quite complicated. Maybe I need to think about the synthesis steps again.

Let me think about the target, which is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So perhaps the correct order is to first add the acetyl group, then nitration, then bromination.

So:

1. Acetophenone (position 1 has acetyl).

2. Nitration: acetyl is meta director, so nitro at 5.

3. Bromination: acetyl and nitro are both meta directors. So Br would go to position 3, which is meta to both.

Yes, that matches the target.

So the correct sequence is acylation â†’ nitration â†’ bromination.

Looking at the options:

Option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So that's not correct.

Option C: step iii is acylation after nitration and reduction. So that's acylation after nitration but after reduction, which may not be the same.

Wait, perhaps in option C, after nitration (i), reduction (ii) gives NH2, then acylation (iii) adds acetyl to NH2's ortho or para. Then bromination (iv) adds Br.

But earlier analysis suggested that this would not give the correct substituent positions.

Wait, but perhaps the correct option is option A. Because in option A, the first three steps (i, ii, iii) give the correct substituents.

After step i, acetyl at 1.

Step ii, Br at 3.

Step iii, nitro at 5.

But then, why does option A have more steps? Because it continues with Fe/HCl, more reactions, which would add more groups, which is not desired.

So none of the options have exactly the three steps in the correct order, but perhaps one of the options is correct despite having more steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about option D.

Option D: i) nitration â†’ nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction to NH2 at 1.

iii) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazonium chloride at 1.

iv) H3PO2 â†’ substitution reaction, perhaps to replace NH2 with Br. So now, Br is at 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 â†’ bromination: Br is ortho/para director. So adds another Br at 2,4,6.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 â†’ acylation. Where would acetyl go now? The ring has Br at 1 and another Br at, say, 2.

Wait, this seems even more complicated, and may not give the correct substituents.

Hmm.

I think I need to go back to the options and think about the entire sequence.

Wait, option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 â†’ bromobenzene (Br at 1).

ii) HNO3 â†’ nitration: Br is ortho/para director. Let's say nitro goes para to Br, so position 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 â†’ acylation. The ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4.

Where would acetyl go? Br is ortho/para (2,6,4). Nitro is meta (1,3,5).

So acetyl would be directed to a position that's ortho/para to Br (2,6,4) and meta to nitro (1,3,5).

So possible positions are 2 and 6 (which are ortho to Br and meta to nitro? Let me see. Nitro is at 4, so meta to nitro are 1,3,5.

Positions 2 and 6 are not in that list. So perhaps acetyl can't go in ortho to Br. Alternatively, maybe it goes para to Br, which is position 4, but that's taken by nitro.

So this sequence may not lead to the correct product.

Option C: i) nitration â†’ nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction to NH2 at 1.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 â†’ acylation. NH2 is ortho/para director, so acetyl goes at 2,4, or 6.

Let's say acetyl at 4 (para to NH2).

iv) Br2/FeBr3 â†’ bromination. NH2 is now at 1, acetyl at 4.

So Br would be directed by NH2 (ortho/para: 2,6,4) and acetyl (meta:1,3,5).

So Br could go to 3 or 5 (meta to acetyl), which are ortho to NH2. Because 3 is adjacent to 4?

Wait, if acetyl is at 4, and the ring has NH2 at 1, then NH2 directs Br to 2,6 (ortho), and 4 (para). Acetyl at 4 directs Br to 1,3,5 (meta).

So the possible positions for Br that are both ortho to NH2 and meta to acetyl would be none. Because ortho to NH2 are 2,6, and meta to acetyl are 1,3,5. So there's no overlap.

Alternatively, Br would go to 2 or 6, which are ortho to NH2 but not meta to acetyl. Or to 5, which is meta to acetyl and para to NH2.

Wait, NH2 is at 1: para is 4, which is taken by acetyl. So Br can't go to 4.

So if Br goes to 5, which is meta to acetyl and not ortho to NH2, but NH2 is a strong activating group, so perhaps Br would be more directed by NH2, but in this case, maybe the acetyl's directing is stronger.

But I'm not sure. If Br goes to 5, then substituents are NH2 at 1, acetyl at 4, Br at 5.

But the target has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So this sequence doesn't lead to the correct structure.

This is really challenging. I think perhaps I should think about each option's overall reaction steps and see which one leads to the substituents in the correct positions, regardless of the order in my initial reasoning.

Another approach: the target has three substituents in the 1,3,5 positions. So perhaps the rings must undergo a Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by nitration, and then bromination. So looking for an option that does acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So after acylation, bromination would add Br at 3, then nitration adds nitro at 5. So after three steps, the target is achieved. The rest of the steps in option A (iv to vii) would add extra substituents, which is not wanted. So option A is not correct.

Option C: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) acylation. So after acylation, substituents are nitro (from i), NH2 (from ii), and acetyl (from iii). Then bromination would add Br. But this seems to lead to more substituents than needed.

So perhaps the correct option is none of them. Wait, no, I must choose from the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first nitrate, then brominate, then acylate. Let me check again.

If I nitrate benzene to get nitro at 1.

Then brominate: nitro is meta director, so Br at 3.

Then acylate: the ring has nitro at 1 and Br at 3. Both are meta directors.

So acetyl would go to position 5 (meta to nitro and Br). So substituents would be 1 (nitro), 3 (Br), 5 (acetyl). But the target has 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). So that's not correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, is there a case where the acetyl is added first, then nitro, then Br. That would give 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). Which is correct.

So the correct steps are acylation, nitration, bromination.

Looking for an option that has these three steps in this order, without extra steps.

Option A has these three steps first, but then has more steps. So the product after three steps is correct, but further steps would alter it.

So perhaps the correct option is option A, and the rest of the steps are not relevant, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of these, but I have to choose the best fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible options again.

Option D: i) nitration â†’ nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction to NH2.

iii) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazonium.

iv) H3PO2 â†’ possibly substitution to introduce Br.

So after step iv, Br is introduced where the NH2 was, position 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 â†’ bromination, adding another Br. But where?

vi) acylation â†’ adds acetyl.

The substituents would be Br at 1, another Br at 2,6,4, and acetyl somewhere. Not matching the target.

Option B: i) Br2 â†’ Br at 1.

ii) nitration â†’ nitro at 4.

iii) acylation â†’ acetyl at 2 or 6.

Then further steps: iv) HNO3 â†’ another nitro? Maybe not.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let's re-examine option C.

Option C: i) nitration â†’ nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl â†’ acylation. NH2 is a strong activating group, so acylation occurs at ortho or para to NH2.

Assuming acetylation at para, position 4.

iv) Br2 â†’ bromination. Now, substituents are NH2 at 1, acetyl at 4.

Br would go to ortho/para to NH2 (2,6,4) and meta to acetyl (1,3,5).

So possible positions are 3 (meta to acetyl and ortho to NH2? NH2 is at 1; 3 is two positions away, so not ortho. Or meta to NH2, which is 3 and 5.

Wait, NH2 is at 1. Ortho positions are 2 and 6. Para is 4. So Br would prefer to go to 2,6,4, but 4 is taken by acetyl.

So Br could go to 2 or 6.

Then, after step iv, the substituents are NH2 at 1, acetyl at 4, Br at 2.

v) HNO3 â†’ nitration: Now, the substituents are NH2 (1), Br (2), acetyl (4).

Nitration would be directed by the strongest director, which is NH2 (activating, ortho/para).

Nitro would go to 2 (ortho to NH2, but already taken by Br) or 4 (para, taken by acetyl) or 6 (ortho).

So nitro would go to 6.

vi) NaNO2 â†’ diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 â†’ substitution, perhaps replace NH2 with Br.

Wait, this is getting too complicated, and the substituents are not aligning with the target.

I think I might have to conclude that the correct option is option A, despite the extra steps, because the first three steps give the correct substituents. The subsequent steps might be for purification or other purposes, but perhaps they don't affect the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only the necessary steps, but the options include all steps, and perhaps the first three are the correct sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps. Let me think about the steps in option D:

i) nitration â†’ nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction to NH2.

iii) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazo.

iv) H3PO2 â†’ substitution to Br (position 1).

v) Br2/FeBr3 â†’ bromination adds another Br, say, at position 3.

vi) acylation â†’ adds acetyl at position 5 (meta to Br and nitro? Or wait, after these steps, substituents are Br at 1, Br at 3.

Then acylation would be directed by Br (ortho/para) and the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps after step iv, Br is at 1. Then step v adds Br at 3.

Then step vi: acylation would be directed by Br (1 and 3). Br at 1 directs to 2, 6, and 4. Br at 3 directs to 2,4,6.

So acetyl would go to position 4 or 6.

But the target has acetyl at 1, which is where Br is now. So perhaps this isn't correct.

I think I've exhausted all options, and perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the first three steps produce the correct substituents, even though the option has more steps. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another thought: the target has Br at 3, which is meta to the acetyl (position 1), and nitro at 5, which is meta to acetyl and para to Br. So perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, nitration, bromination.

Which is exactly the first three steps of option A. So perhaps the rest of the steps in option A are unnecessary or involve other functional groups, but the main product is achieved after step iii.

So the correct option is option A, even though the remaining steps are present.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has three substituents: an acetyl group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The order of substitution is critical due to the directing effects of the substituents:

1. **Acylation (Friedel-Crafts acylation)**: The acetyl group is introduced first. Benzene undergoes acylation with CHâ‚ƒCOCl/AlClâ‚ƒ to form acetophenone (acetyl at position 1).

2. **Bromination**: The acetyl group is a meta-director. Bromination with Brâ‚‚/FeBrâ‚ƒ adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).

3. **Nitration**: The acetyl group remains the dominant director. Nitration with HNOâ‚ƒ/Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„ adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group).

This sequence ensures the correct substituents are introduced in the correct positions to form the target molecule. Among the given options, **Option A** starts with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration, which aligns with the required sequence. While Option A includes additional steps beyond the first three, these are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and do not affect the correctness of the initial sequence.

Other options fail to achieve the correct substitution pattern:
- **Option B** starts with bromination, which would lead to incorrect directing effects for subsequent steps.
- **Option C** introduces nitration first, which would result in the nitro group being added before the acetyl group, disrupting the desired substitution pattern.
- **Option D** involves unnecessary reductions and diazotization steps, which complicate the synthesis and do not lead to the target molecule.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, as it begins with the correct sequence of acylation, bromination, and nitration to achieve the target molecule.

Answer: A
