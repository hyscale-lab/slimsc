Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I think I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. The question is asking which theory never needs this regularization when the energies are high.

Let me look at the options:

A) Superstring Theory
B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
D) Classical Electrodynamics

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through. Regularization is usually a problem in quantum field theories because these involve loop integrals that can go haywire with infinities. So, classical theories might not have this issue because they don't involve the same kind of quantum loops. But wait, the question specifies high energies. Oh, right, at high energies, quantum effects become important, but classical theories don't really account for that.

So, which of these is not a quantum theory? Well, option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's a classical theory, so it doesn't require regularization because it doesn't deal with the quantum divergences. But wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. If a theory is quantum, it might need it. If it's classical, maybe not.

But wait, I should think about each option. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum theory. I remember that QED actually does require renormalization because of divergent loop diagrams. So option C would need regularization, meaning it's not the correct answer.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is another quantum theory. It deals with the strong force and involves things like asymptotic freedom. I think QCD also requires regularization because of similar divergences, especially with things like beta functions and running coupling constants. So option B probably isn't the right answer either.

Superstring Theory is a type of quantum theory too, but it's a theory of everything that incorporates gravity. It's an attempt to unify all fundamental forces. Since it's a quantum theory, I thought maybe it requires regularization. Wait, but string theory deals with higher dimensions and maybe the infinities are handled differently. Or perhaps because it's a background-independent theory? Hmm, not entirely sure. But I'm pretty sure that string theories do require some form of regularization or maybe even don't have the same kinds of divergences as QED or QCD. Or maybe they do, but the question is about which theory never requires it.

Wait, the question is about high energies. Oh, right! At high energies, quantum theories can have problems with perturbative expansions leading to divergences. But in some theories, these divergences are either absent or handled without regularization. Let me think: classical theories don't have these issues because they don't involve the same quantum effects. So for high energies, you might need quantum theories, but the only non-quantum theory here is option D, Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, but wait. At high energies, even classical theories might break down because you can't ignore quantum effects anymore. So in reality, you'd have to use a quantum theory at high energies. But the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So maybe the classical theory doesn't need it because it's not using the same methods.

Alternatively, perhaps some quantum theories are finite and don't require regularization. I'm trying to recall if any quantum theories are finite. Oh, I remember that certain theories, like the Standard Model, require renormalization, but maybe some others don't. Wait, but which one among the options is not a quantum theory?

Looking back at the options, option D is classical. So in classical electrodynamics, you don't have quantum loops, so no divergences in the same sense. So when the question asks which theory never requires regularization, the answer would be D.

But wait, the question is about high energies. At high energies, classical theories would fail because you can't use them anymore. So perhaps the correct theory that doesn't require regularization is a quantum theory that doesn't have the same divergences. Hmm, but I'm not recalling any such theory among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps string theory doesn't require regularization because it handles high energies better. I think superstring theory incorporates higher dimensions and maybe doesn't have the same divergences because the stringy nature of particles smooths out the singularities. So perhaps for superstring theory, regularization isn't needed. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: regularization is a way to make calculations finite by introducing a cutoff, like a higher momentum cutoff. In QED, you have to do this because the perturbative expansions give infinite results. But in some theories, this problem doesn't occur. Wait, but I think all quantum field theories (QED, QCD) have these issues, requiring renormalization, which implies they need regularization steps.

So maybe the only theory that doesn't require regularization is the classical one because it's not a quantum field theory. But again, at high energies, you have to use a quantum theory, so the classical theory wouldn't apply. But the question is phrased as which theory never requires regularization regardless of energy, perhaps.

Wait, the question says "at high energies". So which theory, when considering high energies, doesn't require regularization. So perhaps for some theories, the high-energy behavior is better-behaved, meaning no divergences.

Wait, Quantum Electrodynamics has issues with renormalization, but I think that's at all energies. As for QCD, it's asymptotically free, so at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, which might mean that perturbative calculations are feasible without needing to regularize as much? Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, no. Even if the coupling is weak (like QED at low energies), you still have divergences that need to be handled through renormalization. So regardless of the energy scale, quantum theories like QED and QCD require regularization. Superstring theory is a quantum theory, but perhaps it's a theory that doesn't require regularization because it's background-independent, or because it handles the infinities in a different way, such as through the string's extended nature.

Wait, but I'm not certain about this. Another approach: think about which theories are finite. I remember that some theories, like certain formulations of gravity, might be finite, but I don't think any of the options here are like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) Classical Electrodynamics. Because it's a classical theory, it doesn't involve quantum loops or the divergences that come with them. So when the question asks which theory never requires regularization, the answer is D.

But then, when energies are high, you go into the quantum realm, so classical theories wouldn't be used. But the question is about which theory, regardless of being applicable, never requires regularization. So for example, if you were to naively use classical theories at high energies (which you shouldn't, but the question is about whether regularization is needed), then they don't have the same divergences. So the correct answer is D.


To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on their nature and whether they involve quantum effects, which typically necessitate regularization due to divergences.

### Option A: Superstring Theory  
Superstring theory is a quantum theory that attempts to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity. While it incorporates high-dimensional spaces and string-like particles, it still involves quantum effects and divergences that generally require regularization. Thus, it is not the correct answer.

### Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)  
QCD is a quantum field theory describing the strong interaction. It involves divergences in loop calculations, especially at high energies, where the coupling constant becomes weak (asymptotic freedom). Regularization is still required to handle these divergences, so QCD is not the correct answer.

### Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)  
QED is a quantum field theory describing the electromagnetic interaction. It is well-known for requiring renormalization due to divergences in loop diagrams. Regularization is a standard part of QED calculations, making it an incorrect choice.

### Option D: Classical Electrodynamics  
Classical electrodynamics is a classical theory that does not involve quantum effects or divergences associated with quantum field theories. Since it lacks the loop integrals and infinities that necessitate regularization, it is the only theory among the options that never requires regularization. While classical theories may not be valid at very high energies due to quantum effects, the question asks which theory never requires regularization, regardless of applicability.

### Conclusion  
The theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
