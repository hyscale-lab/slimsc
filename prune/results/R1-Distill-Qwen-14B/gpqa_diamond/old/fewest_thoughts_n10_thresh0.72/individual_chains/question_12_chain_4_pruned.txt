Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me read the question again carefully.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, wait, neutrinos are leptons too, but I'm not sure about their rest mass. Oh wait, neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass in these kinds of problems, right? Or wait, maybe in reality they have some mass, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps it's being ignored. I'll keep that in mind.

So, since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the products (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions are opposite.

I think the key here is to use conservation of energy and momentum. Let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total energy available for the products. This is the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's at rest. So total initial energy is m_pi * c², which is 139.6 MeV.

2. The total energy after decay is the sum
