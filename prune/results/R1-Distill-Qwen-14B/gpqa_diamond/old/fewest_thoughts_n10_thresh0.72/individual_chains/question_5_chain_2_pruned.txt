Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states with definite values. So the operator P here must be the sum of its components in the x, y, and z directions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the direction is arbitrary, along n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, so the operator we're interested in is the component of P along n. So the operator is P_n = (P · n) where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

Wait, but n is in the x-z plane, so its direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle phi is zero since it's in x-z. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So the operator P along n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the respective components of n. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Right, so we can write this as a matrix. Let me write down each component matrix:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So n_x is sinθ, and n_z is cosθ. So P_n = (sinθ)(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that matrix:

First term: sinθ*(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
= [[0, sinθ*(ħ/2)], [sinθ*(ħ/2), 0]]

Second term: cosθ*(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= [[cosθ*(ħ/2), 0], [0, -cosθ*(ħ/2)]]

Adding them together gives the total matrix P_n:

[ [ cosθ*(ħ/2), sinθ*(ħ/2) ],
  [ sinθ*(ħ/2), -cosθ*(ħ/2) ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, the first term's (1,2) and (2,1) elements
