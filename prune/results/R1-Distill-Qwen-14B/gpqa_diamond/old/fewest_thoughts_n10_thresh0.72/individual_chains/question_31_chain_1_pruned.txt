Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to form product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product 3, with options given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that nitric acid and sulfuric acid are used in nitration reactions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, which is a good activating group, so the nitration will probably happen on the ring. Where does the nitro group attach? Since toluene is methyl benzene, the nitration occurs at the para position. Wait, actually, methyl is an activating group, but in nitration, the para position is favored. So product 1 would be para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, no, wait. Toluene's nitration typically happens at the para position because the methyl group is ortho-para directing. But sometimes the para is more favored because of steric hindrance. So yes, product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I think this would be a nitration followed by oxidation? Or wait, the first step is nitration, then the second step is something else. Wait, no, the second step uses MnO2 and H2SO4, which are conditions for oxidation. In the context of nitrotoluenes, I think this would lead to the formation of a nitrobenzene derivative that's been oxidized.

Wait, para-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene) when oxidized. Oxidation of the methyl group in toluene derivatives... Let me think. The methyl group attached to the benzene ring, when oxidized, typically forms a carboxylic acid. So, if I have p-nitrotoluene, the methyl group would be oxidized to a COOH group. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene
