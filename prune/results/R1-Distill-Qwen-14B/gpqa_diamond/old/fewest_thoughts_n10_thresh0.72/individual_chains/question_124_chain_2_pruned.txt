Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particles in a detector. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

Alright, the setup: particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types, traveling at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor do we need so that about two-thirds reach the walls?

Wait, okay, so the initial scenario is that with a Lorentz factor gamma of 20, only one third of the particles make it to the inner walls. But we want to find the gamma that gets two-thirds there.

I think this has to do with time dilation and the particles' decay. Because if the particles are unstable and decay quickly, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (detector's frame) would be longer due to time dilation. So, the question probably relates to how far they travel before decaying.

The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So, the maximum distance a particle can travel before hitting the wall is 30 meters. If a particle decays before that, it won't reach the wall. So, the fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether their lifetime, when multiplied by their speed, allows them to travel at least 30 meters.

Wait, but how does the Lorentz factor come into play here? Oh, right, the proper lifetime (tau) of the particle is shorter, but in the lab frame, it's gamma multiplied by tau. So, the lifetime as seen by the detector is gamma * tau.

The distance the particle travels is speed (v) times the lifetime (t). Since v is approximately the speed of light (since they're ultra-relativistic), v â‰ˆ c. So, the distance is c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but in the initial case, gamma is 20. So, the distance is c * 20 * tau. But wait, the particles can only reach the walls if that distance is greater than or equal to 30 meters.

Wait, no, because the initial scenario is that one third reach the walls. So, perhaps the condition is that some particles decay before reaching the walls. So, the number that reach the walls depends on the probability that the particle's
