Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the scenario is: a particle with spin 1/2 and magnetic moment mu = gamma * Sz is initially aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on in the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. But what happens when the field changes direction suddenly?

Initially, the field is along +Z. The magnetic moment mu is aligned with B, so the spin state is probably an eigenstate of Sz. Since mu is gamma Sz, the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma times the spin's z-component.

But when the field switches to +Y, the magnetic field direction changes, so the Hamiltonian must change. Oh right, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = - mu · B. But wait, in some conventions, it's H = -gamma B S · direction. I think the energy is proportional to the dot product of the spin and the magnetic field.

Wait, the initial state. The magnetic field is along Z, so the spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is turned off, does the spin change? No, the spin doesn't change instantaneously because the system's state doesn't instantly adjust; it's a quantum state until measured. But the Hamiltonian changes when the field changes.

So after the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. Because the field is along Y, so the magnetic moment interacts with the field in the Y direction. Wait, but S is spin angular momentum, and the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So H would be proportional to S_y.

But the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. So the state after the field change is |psi_initial> = |+z> or |-z>, depending on initial alignment, but let's say it's |+z> for simplicity.

So the Hamiltonian is now H = gamma B S_y (I think the sign might not matter for the frequency, but let me think). Wait, the exact expression: the energy is H = -mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, and B is along Y, so mu · B = gamma S_y B. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the sign might affect the phase. But when considering the time evolution, the energy levels determine the oscillation frequencies. So the energies are E = ± (gamma B * (ħ/2) ), because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin 1/2.

Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energies are E_+ = - gamma B * (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B * (ħ/2). So the energy difference between the two states is Delta E = E_+ - E_- = -gamma B ħ.

Wait no, wait: H
