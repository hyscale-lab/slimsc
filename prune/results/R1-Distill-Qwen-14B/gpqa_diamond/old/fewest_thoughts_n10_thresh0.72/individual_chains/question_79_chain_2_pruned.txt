Okay, let's tackle this NMR problem. Hmm, the question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction product's NMR data. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right! That's a common reaction for epoxide ring-opening, maybe using a base like DBU or something similar as a catalyst. Or wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a type of catalyst, perhaps for an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's used in some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

But wait, the product's NMR is given. So the reaction must produce an epoxide or maybe an oxirane derivative. Because the options are all oxirane derivatives. So Compound X is the starting material, which upon some reaction forms another compound, but wait, the product's NMR is given. Or wait, maybe the reaction is opening an epoxide? Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): Singlet, likely a methyl group attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, maybe an electronegative atom or aromatic ring.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another methyl, also singlet. So two methyl groups in the product.
- Then, some aromatic protons. Let's see:

δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, that's four aromatic protons. But wait, styryl groups typically have more. Or perhaps it's a substituted benzene with substituents causing certain splitting. Alternatively, maybe a vinyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring. Let's try to see the pattern.

The 1H NMR has two doublets each with 2H and two more doublets each with 1H. Wait, that suggests an AB system or perhaps a trans coupling in an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with some substituents, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted styrene or something similar.

Looking at the 13C NMR data. Let's list the carbons:

- 21.3 (1C, s): This is a very low shift for carbon, so maybe a methyl attached to something like an oxygen. Like a CH3O group, but wait, no, because the shift is 21, which is more like a CH3 attached to an electronegative atom but maybe an epoxide. Because in epoxides, the adjacent carbons are around 40-60 ppm, I think. Wait, but 21 is more like a regular CH3. Hmm. Oh wait, 21 is more like a CH3 attached to a carbon. Like a CH3-C-O- structure?
