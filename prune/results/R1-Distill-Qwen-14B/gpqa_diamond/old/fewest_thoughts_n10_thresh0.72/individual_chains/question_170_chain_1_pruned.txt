Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know.

The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, is that a column vector? Yeah, I think so. So the state vector is |ψ> = [3i, 4]^T. 

The expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>. Oh right, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. The problem provides the Pauli matrix σ_y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And I remember that the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times σ. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So first, I need to write down the matrix form of S_y. That would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the given matrix. So σ_y is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) times that, meaning each element is multiplied by ħ/2. So S_y becomes:

[ 0*(ħ/2)   (-i)(ħ/2) ]
[ i*(ħ/2)    0*(ħ/2) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0       (-iħ/2) ]
[ iħ/2      0     ]

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [3i, 4]^T. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component.

The first component is 3i, so magnitude squared is (3)^2 =9. The second component is 4, magnitude squared 16. So the total is 9+16=25. Ah, so the norm is 5 because sqrt(25)=5. Wait, but the state vector isn't normalized because its norm is 5, not 1. So the actual state would be |ψ> normalized, which is (1/5)[3i,4]^T.

Wait, but the problem says the spin state is (3i,4). Does that mean it's not normalized? Oh, but when you compute expectation values, you can still use it because the expectation value formula uses the conjugate transpose and the state itself, so the normalization factor will come into play.

So, moving on. To compute the expectation value, I need to calculate <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Let me write this out step by step.

First, <ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ>. So |ψ> is [3i,4]^T. The conjugate would be [-3 (because (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, the conjugate of 3i is -3i. Wait, no, wait: 3i's complex conjugate is -3i. So the
