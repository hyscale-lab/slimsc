Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

So, the question is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods with a specific ratio. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They're asking about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo. The options are A to D, with values around 0.57, 0.69, 0.83, and 0.75.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and other factors like albedo. Since they have the same albedo, that should cancel out in the ratio.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^½, but wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh right, another way to think about it is using the inverse square law. The temperature relates to the orbital distance as T ∝ (L/(16πσd²))^{1/4}, but perhaps a simpler formula is T = T_eff * (R / (2a))^{1/2}, where a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^{1/4} * (a/(1 AU))^{-1/2} ), but since these planets are in circular orbits, e is 0, so that term drops out. Also, all have the same albedo, so A is the same. So the temperature ratio would only depend on their distances.

So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of ( (1 - A) ) and inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. But since A is the same for all, the (1 - A) term is a constant and cancels out when taking the ratio. So T is proportional to (1/(a^0.5)).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_* * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4} * ( (L_*/(16πσ)) )^{1/4} * ( a )^{-0.5} ). Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me get the exact formula right.

The equilibrium temperature equation is given by:

T_eq = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2a) )

Wait, no. I think I'm confusing the star's temperature with the planet's. Let me get it straight.

Actually, the formula for the planet's equilibrium temperature is:

T = ( (S (1 - A)) / (4σ) )^{1/4}

Where S is the solar constant, which is S = L_*/(4πa²), and L* is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's orbital distance.

So substituting S into T's equation:

T = [ ( L_*(1 - A) ) / (4πa² * 4σ) ) ]^{1/4 }

Simplify that:

T = [ L_* (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^{1/4 }

But when we take the ratio of two planets, like T4 / T2, the L*, σ, and (1 - A) terms will cancel out because they're the same for both. So the ratio becomes:

T4/T2 = (a2 / a4 )^{1/2 }

Because the exponents would be 1/4, so when you take the ratio, the (a2/a4) term is to the 1/4 power, but since T4 is inverse proportional to a4^0.5, the ratio would be (a2/a4)^0.5.

Wait, wait.
