Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see if I can work through this. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) meson decays into a muon(+) and a neutrino. Oh right, and the pion is initially at rest.

Wait, the particles involved are Pi(+) with a rest mass of 139.6 MeV and the mu(+) with 105.7 MeV. Oh, and the neutrino must be the other product. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such a tiny mass, almost negligible. I think for these kinds of problems, we usually assume the neutrino's mass is zero. So that might simplify things.

Alright, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, neutrinos are leptons, right? So this decay is possible because of the conservation laws.

So, the energy should be conserved. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's at rest. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But the neutrino's energy will be its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero. Wait, not exactly. The neutrino's energy is the sum of its kinetic energy and rest mass energy, but since m=0, it's just kinetic energy.

Wait, the muon will have some kinetic energy too. So the total energy after decay is (E_muon + E_neutrino) = (m_mu*c² + K_mu) + (K_nu), right?

But wait, the pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So the initial energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino together must have that energy. But the muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero).

So let's write that out:
E_initial = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu

And because of momentum conservation, their momenta must add to zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since p = gamma m v, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of magnitudes. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Hmm, but another approach is to use the fact that in the rest frame of the pion, the total momentum is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So the magnitude of their momenta are equal.

I remember that the total energy squared is the sum of the momentum squared times c^4 plus the rest mass squared times c^4. So for each particle:

E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2
E_nu^2 = (p_nu c)^2 + (m_nu c^2)^2

But since m_nu is zero, E_nu = p_nu c.

Also, because p_mu = p_nu in magnitude (since directions are opposite), let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and then the neutrino's momentum is also p (but opposite direction).

So,

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )
E_nu = p c

So substituting into the energy conservation equation:

139.6 = (sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ) + (p c)

Wait, units are in MeV, so I can treat c as 1 in these units. Because E in MeV, mass in MeV/c², so when multiplied by c² (which is unit conversion), but perhaps it's easier to not worry about the units and just proceed, knowing that we've set c=1 in this context.

So, 139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p

Let me write that equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p

Hmm, how to solve for p. Let me rearrange:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - p

Now square both sides:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2

Expand the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 * p + p²

So,

p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p

Let's compute the numbers.

105.7 squared is about 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that:

105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So 11025 + 147 +0.49 = 11172.49. So 105.7²≈ 11172.49 (MeV²).

139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2=0.36, 2 *139*0.6=166.8. So (139.6)^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 +0.6² = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p

Let's compute 2*139.6 = 279.2. So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p

Rearranging,

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67?

Wait, let me subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?
8315.67 (since 19488 - 11172 is 8316, but the decimals: 0.16 - 0.49 is -0.33, so maybe 8315.67?)

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

19488.16
-11172.49
= 19488 - 11172 = 8316, 0.16 - 0.49 = -0.33 → 8315.67?

So,

279.2 p = 8315.67 → p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So maybe around 29.7 or so?

Wait, 279.2 * 29.7 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, 279.2 * 0.7 = 195.44. So total 8096.8 +195.44=8292.24. That's 29.7, but we have 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67-8292.24=23.43.

So 279.2 * x =23.43 → x≈23.43/279.2 ≈0.084.

So p ≈29.7 +0.084≈29.784 ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So p≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but let's compute it more precisely.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 → let's compute that division.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Approximate: 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 → 8315.67 - 8096.8=218.87.

218.87 ÷279.2 ≈0.783.

So 29.783 → p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Hmm. So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So now, the neutrino's energy is p c, which in units where c=1, is just p → E_nu = 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu^2) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculate 29.78^2: approx 29.78 → 29.78 squared is about 887 (since 30²=900, so 29.78² is a bit less, say ~ 887).

105.7 squared is 11172.49.

So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49. The square root of that is sqrt(12059.49). Let's see, sqrt(12100)=110, so sqrt(12059.49)≈109.81 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, because E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest energy (105.7) plus kinetic energy (K_mu). So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, which is its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero).

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's close to what I calculated.

Wait, let me double-check my numbers. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations?

Let me go back.

When I had the equation:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - p

I squared both sides:

p² +105.7² = (139.6 - p)^2 → 139.6² - 2*139.6 p + p²

Subtract p² → 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p

So 105.7² = 11172.49, 139.6²=19488.16.

11172.49 =19488.16 - 279.2 p → 279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 → p=8315.67 /279.2 ≈29.787 MeV/c.

So E_nu =29.787 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(29.787² +105.7²) → sqrt(887.34 + 11172.49) → sqrt(12059.83) → approx 109.81 MeV.

So K_mu=E_mu - m_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

Hmm, the options show 4.12 and 29.8. My calculation says 4.11 and 29.787. So the closest is option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking back at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → No.

B)7.2,32.8 → No.

C)3.52,20.8 → No.

D)4.12, 29.8 → Yes.

So the answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary positively charged pion (\(\pi^+\)) into a positively charged muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)). The rest masses of the particles are given as follows: \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is assumed to have negligible rest mass (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the energy is the rest energy of the pion:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu,
   \]
   where \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}\) (relativistic energy of the muon) and \(E_\nu = p_\nu c\) (energy of the neutrino, since \(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. This implies:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu \quad \text{(equal in magnitude, opposite in direction)}.
   \]

### Solving for Momentum
Using the above equations, we substitute \(p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p,
\]
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2,
\]
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p,
\]
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67,
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Neutrino Energy**: The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu c = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**: The muon's total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Compute \(29.78^2 \approx 887\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Results
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately:
\[
K_{\mu^+} \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}, \quad K_\nu \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Matching with Options
The closest match to these values is:
**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
