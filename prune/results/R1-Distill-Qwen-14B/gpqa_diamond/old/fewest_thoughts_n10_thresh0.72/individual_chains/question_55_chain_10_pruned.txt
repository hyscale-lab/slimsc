Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR interpretation, but I'll try to think it through. The question gives me the 1H NMR data and asks me to identify the unknown compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that propenyl and butenyl groups are alkenes. Acetate esters have an acetyl group attached. So the structure is something like CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH=CH2 or similar, depending on the substituents.

Looking at the NMR data:

1. 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz) – This is a doublet with a large coupling constant. I think this could be a vinyl proton, perhaps on a double bond. The coupling of 16 Hz is characteristic of trans coupling in alkenes. Wait, no, wait. For alkenes, cis protons couple with a smaller J (like around 10-15 Hz), and trans is larger, around 16 or so. So if it's a doublet with a large J, maybe this is a trans coupling.

2. 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) – Another proton. Dq stands for doublet of quartets? Or maybe doublet of doublets. Hmm. This might be a proton adjacent to a double bond, like a CH2 group next to a double bond. Or perhaps it's the other vinyl proton.

3. 2.1 ppm (3H, s) – A singlet integrating for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal. Probably the acetate's methyl (OAc group) because that's typically around 2.1 ppm as a singlet.

4. 1.6 ppm (3H, d) – A doublet of 3H. This could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, like maybe the CH2CH3 group in propenyl or butenyl. But wait, the double bond is in the propenyl or butenyl group, so maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

So putting this together, the structure is an est
