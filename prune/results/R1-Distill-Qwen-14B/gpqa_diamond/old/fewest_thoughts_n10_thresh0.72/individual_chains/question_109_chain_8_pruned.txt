Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, let me read through the question again. So it's about a bound system of two nucleons in a certain state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin T(NN) equals S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. The final state has T(NN) = 0, and we need to find which partial wave isn't permitted.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli exclusion principle applies here because nucleons are fermions. So their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is a product of spin, spatial (orbital), and isospin parts. Oh right, for identical particles, the overall wavefunction is antisymmetric under exchange, so the product of spin, orbital, and isospin parts must change sign.

The problem says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T is isospin, which I think is either 0 or 1 for two nucleons. Because each nucleon is a spin-½ particle, but in their combination, the isospin is another quantum number. Hmm.

The initial state is 1S0. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would mean S=0, because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. So the orbital angular momentum L is S in the notation, so L=0. And J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0, and isospin T? Well, the initial isospin T_initial is probably 0 or 1. But after emission of X, the final state has T(NN)=0.

So the process is NN (initial) → NN (final) + X. So the emitted particle X carries some quantum numbers.

I think we need to apply conservation laws here: angular momentum and parity.

The particle X is emitted, so the total initial angular momentum and parity should equal the total final. The initial state is 1S0, which has L=0, so J=0. So the initial angular momentum is 0. After emission, the NN system has some L, S, and J, and X has its own l (orbital angular momentum in the partial wave)
