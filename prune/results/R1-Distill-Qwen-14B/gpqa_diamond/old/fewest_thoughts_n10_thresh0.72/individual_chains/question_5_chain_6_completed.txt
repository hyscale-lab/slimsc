Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvectors correspond to the eigenstates of the component along a specific direction. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the eigenvector should be expressed in terms of spherical coordinates or something like that.

Wait, the operator P is given for each component: Px, Py, Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the general form of the operator P in the direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So, n = (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, the sum of squares of the components should be 1, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Or maybe I should represent it as a unit vector. Oh, right, because it's a direction, the vector n should be a unit vector. So, n_x and n_z are cosθ and sinθ, but wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, usually θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, n_x would be sinθ cosφ, and n_z is cosθ. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be either 0 or π/2 or something? Wait, no—if the direction is in the x-z plane, that means the direction is at some angle φ=0 or φ=π, but wait, no—phi is the azimuthal angle. So, if the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, that means phi can be 0 or π, or any multiple, but for the sake of direction, let's say phi=0. So n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), since in spherical coordinates, x = sinθ cosφ, z = cosθ. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The spherical coordinates are:

x = r sinθ cosφ  
y = r sinθ sinφ  
z = r cosθ  

So, if n is in the x-z plane, then y-component is zero, so sinφ must be zero, which implies φ=0 or φ=π. So, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because if φ=0, then x = sinθ, and z=cosθ. Wait, no, wait: wait, if r is 1 (unit vector), then x = sinθ cosφ. So for φ=0, x= sinθ, z= cosθ. Hmm, but that's only if θ is the polar angle. So, the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because when φ=0, it's in the x-z plane. So n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ. So then, the operator P along n is given by:

P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z

Because n_y is zero, so Py term disappears.

So, I need to compute this matrix and then find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the P components are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write that down:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P along n is:

P = (n_x * P_x) + (n_z * P_z)
= (sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) ) + (cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me compute the matrix elements:

The (1,1) element: cosθ * (ħ/2) *1
The (1,2) element: sinθ * (ħ/2) *1
The (2,1) element: sinθ * (ħ/2)*1
The (2,2) element: cosθ * (ħ/2)*(-1)

So the matrix P is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, wait: because for P_z, the first row is [1,0], so when multiplied by cosθ and ħ/2, the (1,1) element is (ħ/2) cosθ.

Similarly, P_x's (1,2) is 1, so when multiplied by sinθ (ħ/2), it's (ħ/2) sinθ.

So yes, that's correct.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue.

So, the matrix equation is:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ) , (ħ/2 sinθ) ]   [a]
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ ), -(ħ/2 cosθ) ] ] [b] = λ [a]
                                      [b]

We can write this as two equations:

( (ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b ) = λ a
( (ħ/2 sinθ) a - (ħ/2 cosθ) b ) = λ b

But since we're looking for the eigenvalue λ = +ħ/2, substitute this into the equations.

Equation 1:

( (ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b ) = (ħ/2) a

Subtract (ħ/2 a) from both sides:

( (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ) a ) + (ħ/2 sinθ b ) = 0

Factor out ħ/2:

ħ/2 [ (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b ] = 0

Since ħ/2 is not zero,

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2:

( (ħ/2 sinθ a ) - (ħ/2 cosθ b ) ) = (ħ/2) b

Subtract (ħ/2 b) from both sides:

( ħ/2 sinθ a ) - (ħ/2 (cosθ +1 ) b ) =0

Again, factor out ħ/2:

ħ/2 [ sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b ] = 0

So,

sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

So now we have two equations:

1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps we can find a relationship between a and b.

From equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b
=> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But cosθ -1 can be written as -2 sin² (θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

Let me compute:

cosθ - 1 = -2 sin²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )

So,

a = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )) / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel: -(-) becomes +.

So,

a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )) / (2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) ] b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b
= cot(θ/2) b

So a = cot(θ/2) b

Alternatively, we can write a = (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) b

So, let me set b = sin(θ/2) k, where k is a normalization constant. Then a = cos(θ/2) k.

So, the eigenvector components are a = k cos(θ/2), b= k sin(θ/2).

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, let me check with equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Substitute a = cot(theta/2) b.

So,

sinθ [ cot(theta/2) b ] - (cos theta +1) b =0

Factor out b,

sin theta cot(theta/2) - (cos theta +1) = 0

Compute cot(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So,

sin theta * [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] - (cos theta +1 ) = 0

Hmm, simplify sin theta as 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

[ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] = 2 cos^2(theta/2)

So,

2 cos^2(theta/2) - (cos theta + 1 ) = 0

But cos theta = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1.

So,

2 cos^2(theta/2) - ( (2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 ) +1 )=0

Simplify inside the parenthesis:

(2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 +1 )= 2 cos^2(theta/2 )

So,

2 cos^2(theta/2) - 2 cos^2(theta/2 ) =0

Which is zero. So the equation holds. So the substitution works.

So, the eigenvector is [a, b] = [k cos(theta/2), k sin(theta/2) ]

Now, we need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So,

|k cos(theta/2)|^2 + |k sin(theta/2)|^2 =1
k² [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] =1
k² (1) =1
k=1 or k=-1.

Since we can choose the phase (global phase doesn't matter in quantum states), we'll take k=1.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait a second. The options given don't have theta, but options C and D have theta/2. Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)

Wait, but I think I might have missed a factor. Because the way the operator is constructed, the eigenvectors could have different normalization.

Wait, no, in our calculation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

But wait, the question says the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n, but in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector is in terms of theta, the polar angle.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D introduces hbar and sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but our solution doesn't have any hbar factors because the vectors are normalized; the hbar is in the operator matrices, not the eigenvectors.

Wait, the eigenvector is a vector of coefficients, not multiplied by hbar. Because the operator is given in terms of hbar/2 matrices, but the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector.

So, the correct eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So that's the answer. But wait, let me think again. Because the operator P is along the direction n, maybe the direction is given as n = (n_x, 0, n_z), which we set as n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, no, the direction in spherical coordinates is (sin(theta) cos(phi), sin(theta) sin(phi), cos(theta) ), but since phi=0, it's (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta) ). So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta). So our previous approach was correct.

Wait, but the operator P is given along n, so the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So, looking at the options, option C is this.

Wait, but let me make sure. Is there a possibility that the eigenvector has a different form? For example, sometimes for spin-1/2 systems, the states are written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ], but in our case, phi=0 because n is in the x-z plane (so phi=0). So the second component would just be sin(theta/2), without any exponential.

So, option C seems to fit.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonic Y(theta, phi), but that's for a state with well-defined L and M, perhaps. But here, the state is spin-1/2, so it's different.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.

So the answer should be option C.


To calculate the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector). Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $P$ becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \lambda \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue. Substituting $P$ and solving the resulting equations, the eigenvector components are found to satisfy:

\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we verify that:

\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = \cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1,
\]

so the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Contains $\hbar$ factors, which are not present in the eigenvector (eigenvectors are dimensionless). This is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Represents spherical harmonics, which are not relevant for spin-1/2 systems. This is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}$. This is correct.
- **Option D**: Introduces additional $\hbar$ and $\sqrt{2/3}$ factors, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector. This is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
