Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule's quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are given, so I must figure out the right approach.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state would involve either a change in rotation, vibration, or both.

Wait, but photons are absorbed when the molecule transitions between energy levels. The photon's energy should match the energy difference between the two states. So the photon's energy is equal to the energy difference between the next state and the fundamental state.

But wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, so what's the next state with the lowest energy? I think the next state could be either the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1) or the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0). Which one has lower energy?

I need to compare the energy differences for these transitions. Let me calculate both.

First, the vibrational energy levels. The energy for vibration is given by the quantum harmonic oscillator formula: E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

For rotation, the energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is calculated as h/(8π² I c), but wait, I think the formula might be E_J = B J (J+1), where B is h²/(8π² I). Because I is the moment of inertia. And I for a diatomic is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass.

So, for rotational transitions, the energy difference between J=0 (fundamental) and J=1 would be E_J=1 - E_J=0. Since E_J=0 is 0, the energy is B*(1)(2) = 2B.

Now, I need to compute the values of these two energy differences and see which is smaller. Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the photon's energy should match whichever transition (
