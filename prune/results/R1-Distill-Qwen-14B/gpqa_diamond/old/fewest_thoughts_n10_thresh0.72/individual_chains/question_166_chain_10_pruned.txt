Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The Lagrangian is given with some terms. Let me parse the terms. The fermions are singlets, N_iR, which are (1,1,0) under SU(2)_L, SU(3)_C, and U(1)_Y. Then there's a scalar doublet S ~ (1,2,1), and a singlet scalar phi ~ (1,1,0). The potential V is a function of phi, S, and H. Wait, but where's H? Oh, wait, maybe H is part of the S or another field? Not sure yet.

The VEVs are given: ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², and ⟨φ⟩=x, ⟨h⟩=v. So phi gets a VEV, and h is another scalar field? Or perhaps h is the Higgs field. Wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs is (2,1,1/2), but here S is a doublet and phi is a singlet. Hmm.

The question is about the mass of H2, which is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. In the Standard Model, the Higgs has a Goldstone boson when the symmetry is broken, but usually, the SM Higgs is the remnant. But in extensions, sometimes you have multiple Higgs fields, leading to multiple Goldstone bosons, some of which might be eaten by the gauge bosons, others remain as physical Higgs or become pseudo-Goldstones.

Wait, the model probably has more than one Higgs field. The potential V(φ,S,H) suggests interactions between these fields. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure. The singlet phi has a VEV, so maybe the symmetry breaking happens through phi. But S is a doublet, so perhaps it's another Higgs field.

In the Standard Model, the physical Higgs is h, and the others are either eaten or become Gold
