Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy in GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, there's a process called pair production where a gamma-ray photon and a CMB photon can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. This process is significant because it affects how long these high-energy gamma-rays can exist in the universe—their lifetime.

So the problem is about the energy threshold where this annihilation becomes efficient enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime. I think this has something to do with the photon-photon cross-section and the density of the CMB photons.

Wait, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Oh right, the CMB photons are low-energy, about a milli-eV. So the gamma-rays are high-energy, and their energy is much higher than the CMB photons.

I recall that the interaction happens when the gamma-ray's energy is much higher than the CMB photon, so that the center-of-mass energy is sufficient to produce the electron-positron pair. The energy threshold for this process is when the center-of-mass energy is at least equal to twice the electron mass, since each electron is about 0.511 MeV. So the threshold is around 1.022 MeV.

But wait, wait. The threshold is when the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame is enough to create the pair. So the condition is sqrt(s) >= 2*m_e*c^2, which is about 1.022 MeV. So s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame.

But how does this relate to the gamma-ray's energy and the CMB photon's energy? Oh, right. Since the CMB is isotropic and the gamma-ray is moving through it, we can model this as the gamma-ray having high energy E and the CMB photon having low energy ε.

In the frame where the gamma-ray is moving, the photon from the CMB is blueshifted due to the Doppler effect. So the effective energy of the CMB photon in the gamma-ray's rest frame is much higher than its rest frame
