Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about space travel at a high fraction of the speed of light and how that affects the perceived travel time for the astronaut.

Alright, so the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 Earth years. But the question is about an astronaut who's 22 years old from their perspective. They want to know how long the trip to Earth will take from the astronaut's point of view.

Hmm, so I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity. Time dilation means that the astronaut's experienced time (proper time) will be less than the time measured in the Earth's frame of reference.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the spacecraft is moving at a constant speed towards Earth. So we're dealing with special relativity here, specifically time dilation and possibly the twin paradox. But in this case, it's not a twin; it's an astronaut whose lifetime we're concerned about.

First, let's figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. But wait, that's from Earth's perspective. From the spacecraft's perspective, because of length contraction, the distance would be shorter. Oh wait, no. Length contraction only occurs in the direction of motion, so the distance the astronaut measures would be less than 163,000 light-years.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The spacecraft is moving towards Earth, so in the spaceship's frame, the distance is contracted. So the proper length (distance in Earth's frame) is L0, which is 163,000 light-years. The length in the spaceship's frame is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).
