Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation states of elements are related to the temperature. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, right? So the photosphere is treated as being in equilibrium, which allows us to use the Boltzmann equation for excitation levels. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. If the energy levels are E1 and E2, and E2 > E1, then the ratio N2/N1 would be proportional to that. 

In this case, the excitation is higher in star_1. So for star_1, N1_iron is higher than N2_iron? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, perhaps the excited state population is higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, the ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming g1=g2, which might not be the case, but the question might ignore that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the same transition for both stars, so g factors are same, so they can be ignored.

Wait, the problem says "twice as excited", so perhaps the population in the excited state (N2) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or does it mean the excitation is higher (like more atoms are excited), so N2/N1 is higher in star_1?

Wait, let me think. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for a particular energy level, maybe the number of atoms in that level is higher in star_1.

Wait, the exact wording: twice as excited. Maybe it's the number of atoms in the excited state. So, for a specific energy level E2, the number of atoms in E2 is 2 times higher in star_1 than in star_2. Or maybe the ratio is 2:1, N1_E2 / N2_E2 = 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential is the same, but the stars have different temperatures, leading to different populations.

Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given, so ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. That's 1.38e-23 J. So k*T is involved here.

But the key equation is probably the Boltzmann equation. So for each star, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, the ratio N1^excited / N1_ground = (g_excited/g_ground) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly for star_2: N2^excited / N2_ground = (g_excited/g_ground) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps N1_excited / N1_ground = 2 * (N2_excited / N2_ground) ?

Wait, not exactly. The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the number of excited atoms in a specific level is double in star_1.

So N1_excited = 2 * N2_excited. 

Assuming that the ground state is the same for both, or perhaps the ratio N_excited / N_total is considered?

Wait, but the problem might be simplifying it by considering that for each star, the ratio of N2/N1 (excited to ground) is given. Let's denote ΔE as the energy difference between the excited and ground states. So for each star, N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but wait: the Boltzmann factor is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). If g2 is the statistical weight of the excited state, and g1 of the ground state, and if g2 = g1, then the ratio simplifies to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So,
