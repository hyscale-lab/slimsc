Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. 

Wait, non-Gaussianity is measured using relative entropy here. The formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state.

So, I remember that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (or sometimes called quantum relative entropy) is used to quantify how non-Gaussian a state is. The idea is that if the state is Gaussian, the del_b would be zero. So if our state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero, but if it's non-Gaussian, del_b would be positive.

But wait, is the given state a Gaussian state or not? The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are usually non-Gaussian, so the state |psi> here should be non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity shouldn't be zero. But wait, sometimes there are cases where the state ends up being Gaussian despite being a superposition, depending on the parameters.

Wait, let me think. The state |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. The general form of a coherent state is |alpha> = exp(-|alpha|²/2) sum (alpha^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>. So |alpha> and |-alpha> are Gaussian states. But when you take a superposition like cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>, does that become Gaussian?

I think in general, a superposition of coherent states is non-Gaussian. But under certain conditions, maybe when phi is zero or pi/2, or when the coefficients make it collapse into a coherent state. Wait, suppose phi is zero: then it
