Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine concerning resistance to anthracnose. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the setup is that there are three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, etc.). They tested these mutants for resistance to anthracnose. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. The knockout plants have varying levels: 75%, 0%, 50%, etc.

The question is about figuring out the gene interactions based on the resistance levels. Also, we know that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor upstream of others.

Let me list out the data again to make it clear:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (no resistance)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (none)
- g1g2: 0% (none)

Hmm. I remember that when you have epistatic relationships, the order of mutations can determine the phenotype. Epistasis is when one gene affects the expression of another gene. So, if Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, a mutation in A will mask the phenotype of a mutation in B.

In terms of resistance, let's think about what each mutant shows. The wild-type is 100%, so any mutant with lower than 100% is more susceptible.

Looking at the single mutants:
- G2 knockout (g2) has 0%, which is the most severe. That suggests that G2 might be very important for resistance. Since it's completely susceptible, maybe it's a key gene, perhaps the transcription factor upstream of others.
- G1 knockout (g1) is at 75%, which is a 25% reduction. So it's still somewhat resistant but not as much as wild-type.
- G3 knockout (g3) is 50%, so it's halfway in susceptibility. 

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is gone. But when only G2 is knocked out, it's already 0%. So what's the deal with g1g2? Well, since g2 alone gives 0%, adding g1 knockout doesn't change the phenotype. That might mean that the effect of G1 is redundant when G2 is already gone. Alternatively, it could indicate that G1 and G2 are in the same pathway, and losing both doesn't change the outcome beyond what's already there.

g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single mutant. G1 alone is 75%, G3 alone is 50%, but together it's 10%. That suggests that their effects are additive. But wait, additive in a way that makes it much worse. Hmm.

g2g3: 0% resistance. So both G2 and G3 knocked out don't change the resistance beyond G2's knockout. Because G2 already gives 0%, adding G3 knockout doesn't affect it. So similar to the g1g2 case.

Now, the key is to figure out which gene is the transcription factor upstream. Since G2's knockout gives 0%, it's likely that G2 is a transcription factor because without it, no resistance. So that would mean G2 is upstream of the other genes.

If G2 is a transcription factor, it probably activates other genes. So, G1 and/or G3 might be downstream of G2.

Looking at the double mutants where G2 is present:

Wait, no, actually, in the double mutants, G2 is knocked out in some cases. So for example, in g1g2, both are knocked out. But when G2 is already knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of whether other genes are also knocked out.

So, with G2 knockout, the resistance is gone, so G2 is likely the master regulator here. Without G2, the downstream genes can't function. So in the double mutants where G2 is knocked out, the resistance remains 0%.

What about when G2 is present? Let's see:

Wait, actually, none of the double mutants have G2 intact. All the double mutants are combinations of two knockouts. So, for example, G1 and G3 are both knocked out, but G2 is normal in that case? Wait no, no, wait, the g1g3 mutant is the one where both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is still functional. Because in the double mutant g2g3, G2 is knocked out, so the resistance is 0%.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: each double mutant is when two genes are knocked out. For example, g1g3 has both G1 and G3 knocked out, but G2 is functional. Similarly, g2g3 has G2 and G3 knocked out, so G1 is functional. Hmm, but wait, in the data given, g2 is completely knocked out (since g2's resistance is 0%). So, the double mutants are when two genes are non-functional.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of genetic pathways. Let me think: G2 is the transcription
