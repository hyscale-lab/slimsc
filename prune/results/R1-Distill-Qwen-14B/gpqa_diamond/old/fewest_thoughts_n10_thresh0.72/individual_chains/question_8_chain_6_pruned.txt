Okay, so I've got this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose. Hmm, I need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the provided data.

Let me start by understanding what's given. The setup is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, are candidates for contributing to anthracnose resistance. They created knockout mutants and double mutants. The results show varying levels of resistance.

The resistance percentages are compared to the control (wild-type), which is 100%. So lower percentages mean higher susceptibility. Let's list the data:

- g1: 75% → resistant, but less than wild-type.
- g2: 0% → super susceptible, maybe a complete loss of resistance.
- g3: 50% → more susceptible than wild-type, but not as bad as g2.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.
  - g2g3: 0% → as susceptible as g2 alone?
  - g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone.

Wait, so what do these results mean? Let's think about possible gene interactions.

First, I remember that when a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that the gene whose single mutation is more severe is epistatic. Epistasis means that the effect of one gene (the epistatic one) masks or modifies the effect of another gene (hypostatic).

Looking at the data:

g2 alone has 0% resistance. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also have 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in both double mutants involving G2, the resistance is as low as when G2 is knocked out alone. So, G2 is epistatic towards both G1 and G3.

Wait, but G2's single mutant is 0%, and the double with G1 is also 0%. So when G2 is not working, whether G1 is present or not doesn't matter. That suggests that G2 is acting in a pathway upstream of G1 and G3. Because if G2 is nonfunctional, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't compensate. So G2 might be a transcription factor upstream of others.

Wait, the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So probably G2 is the TF. Because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is gone, suggesting it's a critical component, perhaps a master regulator.

Now, let's look at G1. The single mutant g1 has 75% resistance. That's a 25% loss. So it's less resistant than wild type but not completely susceptible. When G1 is knocked out along with G3 (g1g3), the resistance drops to 10%. Hmm, so knocking out both G1 and G3 makes it much worse than either single knockout.

So maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, or they have some redundant functions. Because when both are knocked out, the phenotype is much worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are partially redundant—each can compensate for the other. So if you have G1, G3 can take over some function, and vice versa. So when both are missing (g1g3), the function is severely compromised.

So G1 and G3 might be in a redundant pathway. That would explain why g1g3 is so much worse—each contributes to resistance, but individually they can compensate a bit.

Wait, but G3's single mutant is 50% resistance. So knocking out G3 alone reduces resistance, but not as much as G2. But the double mutant with G2 (g2g3) is 0%, implying that G2 is upstream of
