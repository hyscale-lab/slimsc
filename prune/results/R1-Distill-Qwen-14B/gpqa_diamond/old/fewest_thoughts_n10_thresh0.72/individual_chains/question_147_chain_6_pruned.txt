Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I remember that annihilation usually involves particles and their antiparticles. The question says the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, the setup here is that an antiproton is colliding with a proton, and they annihilate into two particles each of A⁺ and A⁻.

The given information is that the mass of A is 300 MeV/c². Wait, no, the question says m_A c² = 300 MeV. Oh, right, because m*c² is the rest energy. So m_A = 300 MeV/c².

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So I need to find v of A in terms of c.

Hmm, when particles annihilate, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So perhaps we can treat it as if it's at rest? Or maybe not exactly, but perhaps that's the approach.

Wait, okay, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. The initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let's assume that the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the initial momentum is from the antiproton only, and the proton is at rest. Or wait, no, wait: the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some
