Okay, so I've got this question about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), or sometimes it's written with ħ, which is h/(2π). Wait, right, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, so the equation simplifies to Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Or wait, maybe I should double-check that. Oh right, the exact expression is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. But sometimes people just write it as ħ for approximation purposes.

The question says the electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its location is Δx = 0.1 nm. So I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, energy uncertainty... I think the relation between energy and uncertainty comes from the time-energy uncertainty principle, but wait, no, wait. Or perhaps it's more direct via the momentum-energy relation. Because in quantum mechanics, the kinetic energy is related to momentum. So maybe I should start by finding the uncertainty in momentum, then relate that to energy.

So first, using the Heisenberg principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. We can rearrange this to find Δp: Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Wait, no, the principle states that the product is at least ħ/2, so the minimum uncertainty in p would be when Δp is equal
