Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A. Let's break it down.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, okay. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each of those protons is next to two equivalent protons. The quartet suggests each of those protons is adjacent to three equivalent protons.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. So the molecule probably has two sets of equivalent protons. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe a di-substituted alkane? Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a diethyl group. Because diethyl ether or maybe something like a diethyl ester. Wait, no, but diethyl ether would have more protons. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's a compound with two ethyl groups attached to something else. Let's see. The triplet (6H) at 0.9 ppm is typical for a CH2CH3 group. So two ethyl groups, each with three CH2CH3 protons. Wait, no, each ethyl group has 3+3=6 protons. But wait, in the triplet, 6H suggests two groups each contributing 3H. Oh wait, each CH2CH3 has a triplet, but wait, in the NMR, the triplet is for 6H. So maybe two equivalent CH2CH3 groups, each as a triplet.

Wait, each CH2CH3 group's triplet comes from the adjacent CH2. So, if the triplet is for 6H, that would mean two CH2CH3 groups, each triplet, but perhaps the splitting is due to coupling with another CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe the quartet comes from a CH2 group next to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is neopentane or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative. But let me think about the other clues.

Compound A undergoes monobromination to form B. So A is a molecule that can undergo bromination, probably via free radical substitution. Monobromination suggests that there's only one type of H being replaced, or perhaps the molecule is symmetric so that only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if A is a diethyl ether, bromination would occur at the ethyl groups. But diethyl ether has two ethyl groups, and bromination would occur at the CH3 or CH2, but that's more for allylic or benzylic positions, perhaps. But I might be getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, maybe A is 2,2-dimethylpropane, but that's neopentane. Its NMR would have a singlet for all the equivalent CH3 groups, but in this case, A has two signals. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a diethyl ether. Because diethyl ether has two ethyl groups attached to oxygen. The CH2CH3 groups would be equivalent, so their protons would be split into a triplet. Let me think: in diethyl
