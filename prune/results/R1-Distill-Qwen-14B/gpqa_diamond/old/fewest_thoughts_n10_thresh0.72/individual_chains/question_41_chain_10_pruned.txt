Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They also mention that c (speed of light in vacuum) is 1.

Hmm, the options are A to D, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, so the glass is moving. The light is going through the glass, which is itself moving. And we're supposed to find the speed of light as observed in the lab frame.

I remember that when objects are moving relative to each other, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because we're dealing with speeds that might be significant compared to the speed of light, right? Because v is the speed of the glass, and light speed is involved.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is propagating in the same direction. So the beam is moving towards the observer as well?

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So if the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, but the glass is moving towards the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me visualize this.

Imagine the lab frame. The glass is moving, let's say to the left at velocity v. And the light beam inside the glass is also moving to the left, but slower because of the index of refraction. Wait, no. Wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer, which is presumably on the left side, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the beam is moving to the left, same as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving towards the observer as well, but at a slower speed.

Wait, but wait. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is in the same direction, that would mean the beam is moving towards the observer as well, but perhaps at a speed determined by the glass's motion and its own speed within
