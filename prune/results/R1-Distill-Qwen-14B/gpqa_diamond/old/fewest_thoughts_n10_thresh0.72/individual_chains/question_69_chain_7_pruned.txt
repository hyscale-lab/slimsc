Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decays. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what do I remember about particle decay and bubble chambers? I think the key here is the concept of lifetime and how it relates to the distance a particle travels before decaying. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation.

So the lifetime in the lab frame, τ, is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, right? Because γ = E / (m c²), but since the units here are in GeV, I can probably ignore c² because it's already accounted for in the energy calculations.

So the energy E of X⁰ is given as 27 GeV, and the rest mass m is 3.41 GeV. Therefore, gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by about 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28. Oh so 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. So gamma is roughly 7.91.

Now, the lifetime τ = gamma * tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so τ ≈63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. 7.91 *8 = 63.28. So 63.28e-16 s is 6.328e-15 s. That makes sense.

But wait, the distance the particle travels before decaying is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. The speed of the particle would be close to the speed of light since it's highly relativistic. So v ≈ c. So the distance L is c * τ.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? No, because the particle is moving, and the lifetime is longer. So the distance is v * gamma tau_0. But since v is nearly c, L is approximately c * gamma tau_0.

So, L = c * gamma tau_0. Let me calculate that. c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s.

Multiply 3e8 by 6.328e-15. Let's compute that.

3e8 is 3 *10^8, 6.328e-15 is 6.328 *10^-15. Multiplying 3 *6.328 is about 18.984. Then 10^8 * 10^-15 is 10^-7. So 18.984e-7 meters. Which is 1.8984e-6 meters, or approximately 1.9e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So
