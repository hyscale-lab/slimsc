Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. 

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a bit unusual because I thought quantum states are usually represented by vectors with complex numbers. But maybe it's okay, I'll go with it. Let me write down the state vector ψ. So ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1 ]
        [ 2 ]
        [ 1 ]

But wait, quantum states are usually normalized, right? So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that. (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So total is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector. Maybe I need to normalize it first. So the norm is sqrt(6), so each component should be divided by sqrt(6). 

So the normalized ψ would be:

ψ = [ -1/sqrt(6) ]
        [ 2/sqrt(6) ]
        [ 1/sqrt(6) ]

Wait, but the question says, "the state of a system at time t is given by the
