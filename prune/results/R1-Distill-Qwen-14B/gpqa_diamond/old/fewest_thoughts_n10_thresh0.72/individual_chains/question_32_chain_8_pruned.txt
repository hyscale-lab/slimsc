Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, let's see. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So, if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

So, the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle depends on its relativistic mass. Oh, right, the total energy is given by gamma times the rest mass energy.

But wait, what's gamma? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that. Let me plug in the numbers. So v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. Let's calculate that: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh wait, sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(784/10000) which is 28/100 = 0.28. So yeah, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is mc². The mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². Neutrons are a bit heavier, around 940 MeV/c² each.

Wait, so Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total mass is 3
