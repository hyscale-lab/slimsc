Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question says it's a white solid, so that might give a clue about the physical state, but I'm not sure how relevant that is for the spectral analysis. Let's look at the data.

The mass spec shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%). Then there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, molecular ion peaks are usually the molecular weight. So the molecular weight is 156. The peak at 158 is 32%, which is a bit higher than 1% so maybe it's a fragment or isotope. Wait, chlorine has an isotope at around 35Cl, so if the molecule has Cl, the molecular ion would have a higher mass. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with a Cl added.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But since it's broad and in that region, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. If it's ester, it's around 1730-1750. Alternatively, maybe a ketone or aldehyde. But the broad peak might suggest it's a carboxylic acid since they have O-H stretches which are usually broader than alcohols because of hydrogen bonding.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, which usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton (around 9-10) or a carboxylic acid proton (around 10-12). But aldehydes are around 9-10, so a singlet at 11 is more likely a carboxylic acid -OH proton. Wait, but in D2O, the -OH proton would exchange and not show up. But if the
