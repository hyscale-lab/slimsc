Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

Next, the 2D NOESY NMR spectra are considered. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, let me break down each part.

1. **Understanding the Anhydride Structure:**
   The anhydride comes from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid with an alkene would form a cyclic anhydride, perhaps a maleic anhydride-type structure. The NMR data can help confirm this.

   - The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That region is typically for protons on an alkene or aromatic ring. But since it's a singlet, maybe it's a pair of equivalent protons in a symmetric environment. Wait, but 7 ppm is more likely to be an alkene proton. Alternatively, maybe it's vinyl protons in a conjugated system, like in an anhydride. Wait, in maleic anhydride, the protons are on the double bond and are deshielded, so they appear around 6-7 ppm. But wait, maleic has two sets of protons because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are different. But wait, in the anhydride here, the 1H NMR shows only one peak. Hmm.

   Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is such that the double bond is now part of the anhydride ring. For example, if the dicarboxylic acid is cis, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. Let me think: if the starting acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, no, the starting material is a cis-alkene, so perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't right. Wait, maybe the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, wait, the alkene would be between the two COOH groups. So, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in between, like HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? Wait, but that would be a diene, but if it's a cis-alkene, perhaps it's more like HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but that might not form a cyclic anhydride upon dehydration. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond in betweenâ€”like HOOC-CH2-CH=CH2-COOH? No, that doesn't make sense in terms of dehydration. Wait, perhaps it's a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, that would not form a cyclic anhydride when dehydrated. Wait, maybe the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH. Dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, but wait, maybe it's a maleic anhydride analog.
