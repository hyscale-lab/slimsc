Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Let me read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So like, closer stars have larger parallaxes, and farther ones have smaller.

The question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, per unit range of distance, r. So I think this is about how the density of stars or the number density changes as you go further out.

Wait, the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I know that parallax plx is proportional to 1/distance r. So plx = 1/(r), where r is in parsecs, I think. So if I substitute that into the equation, plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx.

So substituting, 1/(plx)^5 becomes 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which is r^5. Oh wait, because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 over that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But wait, am I mixing up something? Let me think again. The number of stars in a region is given by this relation. So if parallax decreases as you go farther (plx = 1/r), then the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5) → which is (r)^5. So as r increases, N increases with r^5.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of stars in the region depends on how many are within a certain distance range. Or is it the number density? Because if you have a certain volume, the number of stars depends on how many are in that volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is given by this relation. Let me think. Parallax is 1/r, so plx = 1/r. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → substituting, N ∝ r^5.

But wait, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density at radius r. Or perhaps it's the number density multiplied by the volume.

Wait, maybe I should model this as the number of stars per unit volume. So the number density N(r) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5. So N(r) ∝ r^5.

But then the total number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be N(r) * 4πr² dr. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4πr² dr. So that would be (r^5) * (r²) dr = r^7 dr. But wait, the question isn't about the total number in a shell, it's about how the number changes with distance, per unit range.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just about the number density, which is N per unit volume. If N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars per unit volume increases as r^5.

But the question states "the number of stars in that region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So perhaps the number of stars in a given region (like a volume) is proportional to 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (distance is big), the number increases as 1/(small)^5, which is a big number.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars (N) in the region is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, that's (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5.

Wait, but if you're looking at a certain region (like a volume) at a certain distance, then as you go further, the volume you're considering (like a cube or sphere) is bigger, but the number density (stars per unit volume) is also increasing. So the total number of stars in that region would go up as r^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit range. So per unit distance, r. So looking at the change in N per unit r.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the number of stars per unit distance. Wait, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r." Hmm, maybe it's the number of stars per unit volume, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, I think the way to approach this is to consider that the number of stars in a volume is N = k * (1/plx^5) = k * r^5. So if you have a volume that's a function of r, say a sphere with radius r, the volume is (4/3)πr^3. So the number of stars in that sphere would be N = (4/3)πr^3 * (number density at r). If the number density at r is n(r) = r^5, then N = (4/3)π r^3 * r^5 = (4/3) π r^8. But that would mean the total number of stars in the sphere increases rapidly as r^8, but I'm not sure that's directly relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about how the number of stars in a fixed volume (like a unit volume) changes with distance. If the number density is n(r) = number of stars per unit volume, and n(r) ∝ r^5, then per unit volume, the number increases as r^5. But the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So if the number of stars in a region increases as r^5, the number of stars per unit distance would have to be considered.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it in terms of differential. The number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr is 4π r² dr multiplied by the number density at radius r.

If the number density n(r) is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in dr is n(r) * 4π r² dr = (k r^5) * 4π r² dr = 4π k r^7 dr. So the number of stars per dr (per unit distance) is proportional to r^7. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ r^5. So the total number in a region (which depends on the size of the region and the number density) would be N = (some volume) × (number density). But perhaps the region's size isn't changing? Or maybe the region is fixed as a certain angular area, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, which is n(r) ∝ r^5. So the number of stars in a region (like a cubic parsec) would be proportional to r^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps they're considering the number of stars per unit distance, which would be the integral of the number density over a distance. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to approach this from another angle. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1/distance (r), in parsecs. So plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So the given relation for the number of stars N is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → substituting r, N ∝ r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if you have a small change in r (dr), how does N change? Well, dN/dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

If N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So that would mean the number of stars increases by r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but the options are the dependencies on r, so the number per unit range (dr) would be proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that N varies with plx as 1/plx^5, so N = k (1/plx^5) = k r^5.

If you're looking for how many stars are present as you go from r to r + dr, it would be proportional to r^5 per dr, which would be (r^5) dr. But per unit distance, that's r^5. But that seems not to fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the number density, n(r) = N / volume. Wait, but the number of stars N depends on the volume and the number density.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of flux. No, wait, flux is about brightness. Hmm. Another approach: the number of stars in a given volume (like a sphere) is N = number density × volume. If the number density n(r) is proportional to r^5, then N = n(r) × (4/3 π r^3) = (4/3 π) × r^5 × r^3 = (4/3 π) r^8. So the number of stars in the sphere increases as r^8. But the question is about per unit range of distance, so not the total number.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. For a fixed volume (like a unit cube), the number of stars would increase as r^5. But if you're considering a region that expands with r (like a sphere of radius r), then the number of stars increases with r^8. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the question says "the number of stars in that region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So perhaps the region is a fixed angular size, implying that the volume is increasing with r^3 as r increases (since volume is proportional to r^3). So, for a fixed angular size (like a fixed field of view), the actual volume you're looking at is 4/3 π r^3 (if it's a spherical volume). So the number of stars in that fixed angular region would be N = n(r) × (4/3 π r^3). If n(r) is proportional to r^5, then N would be proportional to r^8.

But wait, the question says N varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So if N is proportional to r^5, that would imply that the product of n(r) and the volume of the region is r^5. So if the region's volume is r^3 (as r increases), then n(r) must be proportional to r^2. Because n(r) × r^3 = r^5 → n(r) = r^2.

Wait, maybe that's the case. Let me think again. Suppose the region is a fixed solid angle, so the volume is proportional to r^3 (since for a fixed solid angle, the volume is r^3). Then, the number of stars N in that volume is proportional to the number density × volume. If N ∝ 1/plx^5 = r^5, then N = n(r) * (volume) = n(r) * r^3. So r^5 = n(r) * r^3 → n(r) = r^2. So the number density, n(r) is proportional to r^2.

But the question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance. So, the number of stars N in the region is proportional to r^5. So if you go from r to r+dr, the change in N would be dN = 5 k r^4 dr. So per unit dr, the number of stars increases by ~ r^4.

So the change in N per unit distance (dr) is proportional to r^4, which would make the answer option C: ~r^4.

Alternatively, if the question is about the number density, which is n(r) = r^2, then the number of stars per unit volume increases as r^2, but the question isn't about that.

Wait, but the question says "the number of stars in that region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars in the region increases as r^5. So if you consider a small change in r, the change in N is proportional to r^4, as the derivative of r^5 is 5r^4.

So the answer would be option C, ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto r^5 \), meaning the number of stars in the region increases as the fifth power of distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range (\( r \)), we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). If \( N \propto r^5 \), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

This shows that the change in the number of stars per unit distance (\( dr \)) is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars in the region increases with distance as \( r^4 \) per unit range of distance.

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
