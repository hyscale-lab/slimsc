Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I remember that phosphate ions can exist in different forms depending on the pH of the solution because of the multiple dissociation steps of phosphoric acid.

First, the problem states that the solution's volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There are 1.00 grams of each of the two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is the HPO4^2- form because that's the second dissociation step. Or wait, orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, but in solution, it can lose protons to form different species. Oh wait no, ortho is the fully protonated form, but in solution, it's more about the species present. Hmm, wait, maybe I should clarify the phosphate species.

Wait, the phosphate ion can exist as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's not common because it's a weak acid. So when the problem says orthophosphate ions, I think they're referring to HPO4^2-, which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. Or wait, no, wait: when you have Na2HPO4, that's the sodium salt of HPO4^2-. Similarly, KH2PO4 is the salt of H2PO4^-.

So, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. I think these two will react with each other, trying to reach an equilibrium. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can gain a proton to become H2PO4^-.

Wait, but how does this affect their concentrations? I think the solution will buffer around the pH where the ratio of these species is based on their Ka values. 

Looking at the Ka values given: for H
