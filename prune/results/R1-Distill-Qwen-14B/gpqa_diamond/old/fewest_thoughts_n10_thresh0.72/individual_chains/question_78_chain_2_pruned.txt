Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field caused by a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it creates both electric and magnetic fields, which are described by the scalar and vector potentials. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions, so I need to think this through.

The problem states that a charge q is moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a later time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. The observation point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, so d would be r minus the position of the charge at tr, which is s(tr), I think.

The question asks for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions. I need to figure out which expressions are correct.

First, I should recall the general expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge. The scalar potential V is typically due to the electric field, and the vector potential A is due to the magnetic field. For a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the observation point. But when the charge is moving, things get a bit more complicated because you have to consider the fields at an earlier time, and maybe relativistic effects or retarded potentials.

Wait, right, retarded time is when the fields at a point depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. So the potentials depend on the charge's state at tr, which is before the observation time t.

So the scalar potential for a moving charge would account for the charge's position at time tr, and the vector potential would involve the velocity or maybe acceleration. But I'm not sure about the exact forms.

Let me think about the Liénard potentials. Oh yeah, the Liénard formula gives the potentials for an arbitrary charge distribution in motion. The scalar potential V is due to the charge's presence, but affected by the motion. The vector potential A comes from the motion of the charge, specifically its velocity.

The general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials in the case of a point charge are:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / ( |d| - (v·d̂)/c ) ]

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. The denominator is the distance adjusted for the motion. Oh, because the charge is moving, the effective distance isn't just |d|, but has a term involving the velocity. Hmm, the denominator might be something like (d·c - v·d), but I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

Wait, another approach. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by some function of the charge's position and velocity. Similarly, the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity v of the charge, multiplied by some constants, and divided by the same denominator as V.

Looking at the options, let's see:
