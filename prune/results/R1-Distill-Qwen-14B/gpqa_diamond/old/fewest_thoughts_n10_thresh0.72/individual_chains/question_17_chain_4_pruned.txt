Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, KCa-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex here is probably the calcium-y complex, like maybe CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, Kf, tells us about the stability of the complex.

Wait, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, they're giving me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Since the complex is stoichiometric, each mole of CaEDTA^2- comes from one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if the solution is in equilibrium, some of the complex might dissociate. So [Ca²+] won't just be 0.02 M; it's much lower because Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable.

Right, Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the approximation is that [Ca²+] is much less than the initial concentration of the complex, so we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, but when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the change would be x for each. So let me write the expression.

Let’s let the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium be x. Since the complex dissociates, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. The concentration of CaEDTA^2- would be approximately 0.02 - x. But if Kf is so large, x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the Kf expression is (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 → square root is 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is smaller. Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 10^(-6.
