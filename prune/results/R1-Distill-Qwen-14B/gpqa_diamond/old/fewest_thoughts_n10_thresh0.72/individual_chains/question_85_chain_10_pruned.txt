Okay, so I have this problem here about two planets orbiting a star. The question is about finding the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that's calculated based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but wait, I think I might have messed up the exact formula. Oh wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that part simplifies. So, I can ignore the albedo because both planets have the same albedo, so it cancels out in the ratio. Oh, right, because both have same A, so (1-A) is same for both, so when we take the ratio, it cancels. So the albedo doesn't affect the ratio here.

The star's parameters are given: mass 1.5 solar, radius 1.2 solar, Teff 6300 K. But wait, Teff is the surface temperature of the star. The star's luminosity is calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So the luminosity of the star is proportional to R^2 Teff^4. But in the equilibrium temperature formula, we're looking at the star's flux at the planet's distance. So the flux S at the planet's position is S = L / (4π a² ) = (R_star² Teff^4) / (a²) ) * (sigma and 4pi cancel out). So S is proportional to (R_star^2 Teff^4) / a².

So the equilibrium temperature for each planet is T_p = Teff * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) ) / sqrt(2)^something? Wait, let me re-derive the formula correctly. The equilibrium temperature is given by the balance between absorbed stellar radiation and emitted thermal radiation. So the equation is:

Incoming flux: S = (L
