Okay, so I'm trying to solve this qPCR question. Let me think through it step by step. 

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran it on serially diluted samples, three technical replicates each. The efficiency was 100%, R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. 

Looking at the data, for each concentration, the Ct values are pretty close but vary a bit. For example, 100000 copies gave Ct results around 34, with a range from 33.9 to 34.5. Similarly, the other concentrations show similar tight ranges. 

Wait, but why are the Ct values so similar between the samples? Oh, because the efficiency is 100%, so each dilution should decrease the Ct by a certain amount. The slope being -3.3... Hmm, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is usually ln(10)/log10(efficiency). For an efficiency of 100%, which is 1, the log efficiency is 1, so ln(10)/1 is about 2.3026. Wait, but the slope here is -3.3, which is larger. That's confusing because if the efficiency is 100%, the slope should be around -3.3219? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the calculation.

Wait, the standard formula is slope = ln(10)/ (log10(efficiency)), but I think it's actually for 100% efficiency, the slope is -3.3219 because log2(10)=3.3219, but wait, no. Let me think about the relationship between efficiency and the slope.

The formula for the slope when you plot Ct vs log concentration is m = - (log10(efficiency) ) * ln(10). Wait no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, another approach is that for a perfect 100% efficient PCR, each dilution by a factor of 10 should change the Ct by approximately 3.32 cycles. Because each 10-fold dilution reduces the quantity by 10 times
