Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So first, I should probably calculate the concentration after dilution. Then, when titrating, I'll need to figure out the moles involved at 25% and at equivalence.

Let me start with the dilution part. Acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH, and it's being diluted with water. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) and concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ (another 0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L).

To find the new concentration, I can use M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. M2 is what I'm looking for, and V2 is 0.04 L.

Calculating:
M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2
= (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L
= (0.001 moles) / 0.04
= 0.025 M.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will equal moles of acetic acid. But wait, before that, when it's 25% titrated, only 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

First, let me find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence point, all of this will react with NaOH. But for 25% titration, only 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH are added.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the volumes. The volume of NaOH added for 25% titration. Let's see, the total volume of solution at equivalence will be when moles of NaOH equal moles of CH3COOH.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So 25% titration means 25% of 10 cm³ is added, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution. So the volume added is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ of the acetic acid solution, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³. But maybe for the calculations, I can consider each case separately.

Let's tackle the 25% titration first
