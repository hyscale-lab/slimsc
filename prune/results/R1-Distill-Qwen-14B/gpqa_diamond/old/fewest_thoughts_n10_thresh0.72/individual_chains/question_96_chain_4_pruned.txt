Okay, so I have this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. I'm a bit rusty on my black hole thermodynamics, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy. The options are A to D, each an exponent of 10.

Hmm. I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So my first goal is to find the area A.

Wait, A is the area of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4π r², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. Alternatively, since we're given the angular size, maybe I can find the radius that way.

Angular size θ is related to the actual size and distance. The formula I think is θ (in radians) ≈ size / distance. But wait, θ is small, so the approximation θ ≈ (size) / (distance) in radians holds. But since θ is given in degrees, I need to convert that to radians first.

So let's compute θ in radians. θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. To convert, multiply by π/180. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

The size here would be the diameter of the event horizon, right? Because the angular size is the angle subtended by the diameter. So, the formula would be θ ≈ (2r) / d, where r is the radius of the event horizon.

Wait, actually, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2GM/c², so the radius of the event horizon is R_s / 2? No, wait, the Schwarzschild radius is already the radius of the event horizon. So R_s = 2GM/c². So the diameter is 2 R_s.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The event horizon is a sphere with radius R_s. So the diameter is 2 R_s. So when we measure the angular size θ, it's roughly equal to (2 R_s)
