Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, let's break this down.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radius, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. 

Wait, so the main thing here is transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_p / a)^2, but wait, no, that's the area ratio, but actually the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a), right? Because the area is πr², but the probability is more about the relative size.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but for Earth-sized planets and stars, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the transit probability is roughly (R_star) / (a) multiplied by something else. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me think. The transit probability (P) is the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit (a) projected on the sky, compared to the star's size. So it's roughly (R_star / a), but I might have it inverted. Or wait, maybe it's (R_star / a)^2 because it's a geometric probability. Hmm.

Wait, no. The transit occurs when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the alignment of the orbit. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_* / a), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)² multiplied by something else? Or perhaps it's a geometric consideration.

Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_s / a)², where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). Because the area of the star is πR_s², and the area where the planet can transit is the circle's area, but wait, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. Because the planet's orbital plane must be aligned so that the planet passes in front of the star as seen from Earth.

Wait, that makes sense. So the probability is (R_star / a)^2. So P = (R_s / a)^2.

But wait, another source I remember says it's (R_s + R_p) / a. But if the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, like Earth and Sun, R_p is negligible. So it's approximately R_s / a.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. This is a geometric probability. The formula is given by the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit. Or wait, the formula is actually (R_star / a)² multiplied by the solid angle or something else?

Hmm, I think the correct formula is P ≈ (R_*/a)². Because the star's radius is R_*, and the planet's orbit is a circle of radius a. So the probability is the area of the star divided by the area of the orbit. The area of the star is πR_*², and the area of the orbit is πa². So the ratio is (R_*² / a²) = (R_*/a)^2. So yes, P is proportional to (R_* / a)^2.

So the transit probability is higher when the star is larger (R_*) and when the planet is closer (smaller a).

In this problem, both stars have the same radius (R1 = R2). So R_* is the same for both. So the probability depends on a, the orbital radius.

But wait, the orbital period and the star's mass are related through Kepler's third law. Remember, for a planet orbiting a star, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* dominates. So P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_*)) a³. So a³ = (G M_* P²) / (4π²). So a = [ (G M_* P²) / (4π²) ]^(
