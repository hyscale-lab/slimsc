Okay, so I need to figure out why there are discrepancies in the scientist's qPCR results. Let's take this step by step.

First, I'm a bit rusty on qPCR, but I remember that it's used to quantify nucleic acids. The idea is that each cycle corresponds to a doubling of the target DNA. The Ct value is the cycle number where the fluorescence crosses a certain threshold. Lower Ct means more copies because it reaches the threshold sooner.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it serially and ran three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which means each cycle perfectly doubles the DNA. An RÂ² of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship, so the data should fit the curve perfectly.

The slope of the curve is -3.3. Wait, in qPCR, the slope is related to the efficiency. The formula I remember is that the slope equals log(E) / log(2), where E is the efficiency. Since E is 100% (E=1), log(1) is 0, so the slope should be zero. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Or wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is that the slope is approximately -3.32 when efficiency is 100% because it's based on log10 to log2 conversion. Oh right! Because when you plot log10(copy number) vs. Ct, the slope is -log10(Efficiency)/log10(2), which for E=1 would be -3.32. So the slope here being -3.3 makes sense; it's close to that value.

Now looking at the Ct values. Each dilution is a ten-fold decrease. Let's see the Ct differences between each concentration. 

At 100000 copies: Ct ~34
At 10000: Ct ~31
So the difference is about 3 cycles. Each dilution is 10x, so each should correspond to a 3.32 Ct difference. So 3 cycles is close to that. Next, 10000 to 1000 copies: Ct goes from 31 to 27.3. That's a 3.7
