Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles with a short lifetime decay very quickly, so the distance they travel before decaying is small. So the formula probably involves the lifetime and the speed of the particle. Oh right, the mean decay distance should be the product of the particle's velocity and its lifetime. Because distance is velocity multiplied by time.

So, the formula is: mean decay distance L = v * τ, where τ is the lifetime. But how do I find τ? Oh, right, the lifetime is related to the particle's width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV. I need to make sure the units are consistent. The reduced Planck constant ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Let's compute that. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let's see, 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, that's 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds?

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV and mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, I can find its velocity using relativistic energy equations.

The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So (E² - (m c²)^2) = (pc)^2. So p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c. But since we're working in units where c=1 (probably easier), then p = sqrt(E² - m²).

Wait, but since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c²? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1. So in natural units, E in GeV, m in GeV/c², but since c=1, m is in GeV. So yeah, E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV.

Calculating that: 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. Square root of 62.56 is about 7.91 GeV. So p ≈ 7.91 GeV.

Then, the velocity v is (p c) / E. Since p = gamma m v, but maybe a better way is to find beta, which is v/c = p/(E) * sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)) )? Wait, no, another approach: beta = v/c = p c / E. Because p c = gamma m v c², but maybe I'm mixing things.

Wait, in natural units, p = gamma m v, since p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So v = (p c) / E. Or in natural units where c=1, v = p/(E) * c. Hmm, perhaps better to express beta
