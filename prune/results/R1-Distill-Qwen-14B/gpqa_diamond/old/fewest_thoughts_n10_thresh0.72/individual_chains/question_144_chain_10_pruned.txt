Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, let me read the details again.

The production energy is 8 GeV, the mass is 1.2 GeV, and the width is 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances. I remember that when particles decay, their mean lifetime is related to their decay width. Oh wait, yes, the mean lifetime τ is given by ħ divided by the decay width Γ. Because Γ is the total decay rate, so τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, wait. Wait, no, I think the formula is τ equals Planck's constant over 2π multiplied by ħ, right? Because the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh right, the correct formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Or is it divided by (2πΓ) or something else? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. I think the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So rearranging, τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense because Γ is the decay rate, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

But wait, I've also heard about the natural line width and the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the decay width Γ is related to the uncertainty in energy, which is ΔE = ħ/τ. So Γ is approximately ΔE. So yeah, τ = ħ/(Γ).

But wait, the problem is about the mean decay distance, not the lifetime. Oh right, so the mean decay distance, sometimes called the decay length, depends on the particle's velocity
