Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-classical a state is, right? Gaussian states are like the classical ones in quantum optics, like coherent states or thermal states, which have well-behaved, smooth distributions. Non-Gaussian states, like the Schrödinger cat, are more exotic and exhibit things like superposition and entanglement.

The problem gives me a specific state |psi>, which is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is written as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. Oh wait, alpha is 0.5 and phi is -pi/4.

The normalization constant N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). I remember that coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, and when you form a superposition like this, the normalization involves the overlap between the two states.

Wait, the density matrix for |psi> would be |psi><psi|, so rho is a pure state. The reference Gaussian state's density matrix is tau. But what kind of Gaussian state are we considering here? Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the reference Gaussian state is probably the closest Gaussian state to it, maybe the one with the same first moments but Gaussian statistics.

But wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Oh wait, no: the relative entropy is S(rho || tau) which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But the way it's written here, it's trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, the relative entropy between rho and tau is usually S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the problem says del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So that's not the same as the usual relative entropy
