Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a specific compound. Let me take it step by step.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, wait, di-substituted aromatic ring—so that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The total carbons are 8, which includes the ring and the substituents. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents add up to 2 more carbons. But wait, wait—if each substituent is attached to the ring, and they're two substituents, maybe each is a single carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, wait, no. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents attached, so each substituent would add to the count. So the ring is 6 carbons, so substituents sum to 2 carbons. So maybe each substituent is a methyl group? Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or something else.

But wait, the FTIR has peaks indicating a carbonyl group (-C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh! So the compound has both a carbonyl group and a halogen substituent on the benzene ring. So the two substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe an acetyl group) and
