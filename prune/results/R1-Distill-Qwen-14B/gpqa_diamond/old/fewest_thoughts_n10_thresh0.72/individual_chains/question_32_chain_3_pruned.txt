Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Let me see, the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and usually 4 neutrons, making it lithium-7. But here it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that would be lithium-6? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, the energy we're looking for is the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, the question says "the energy of RHIC" probably refers to the kinetic energy. Or does it? Wait, sometimes colliders' energy specifications refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes to the total energy. I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider". From what I recall, colliders typically specify the kinetic energy of the ions. Let me think about how that's calculated.

The total energy of a moving particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m_0 c². But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, let's compute gamma.

v is 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, 1/0.28 is about 3.5714. So gamma is approximately
