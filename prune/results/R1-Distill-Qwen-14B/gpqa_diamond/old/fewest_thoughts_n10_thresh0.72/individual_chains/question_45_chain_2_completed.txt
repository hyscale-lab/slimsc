Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for the system. The given energy E is defined as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). Each particle is spin-1/2, which probably means they can have spin up or down, but since they're in a 1D well, maybe the spatial part is more important here.

Wait, but wait. For identical particles, especially fermions like electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. Oh, right, in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), which is n² times E. So E_n = n² E, since E is given as the base case for n=1.

So four identical spin-1/2 particles would each have a different spatial wavefunction, but since they are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But spin is part of that. Since each particle has spin-1/2, they can be in either spin-up or spin-down states.

Wait, but in a 1D well, the spatial part and spin part together make the total wavefunction. So for each particle, the spatial wavefunction could be the same as another if their spins are different. Or perhaps not, because the particles are identical and the wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the possible combinations of their quantum numbers.

Each of the four particles must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin. Let me think: each particle has a principal quantum number n. But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum number is just n, because it's one-dimensional. So each state is characterized by n and spin.

Wait, no. Wait, no, in a 1D well, the quantum number is just n. Spin is an additional degree of freedom. So for each n, we can have two possible spin states: up or down. So each n can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. So for each n level, we can have two particles. So for four particles, we'd need to fill up the lowest possible n's, ensuring each particle has a unique state.

Wait, the ground state would be the lowest possible energy. So how do we arrange four particles in the well, considering their spins?

Let me try to figure out the possible states. Each particle must have a unique state, so for four particles, we need four different states.

The ground state would have the lowest possible n's, with spins arranged so that each can share the same n where possible.

Wait, the first energy level (n=1) can hold two particles with opposite spins. Similarly, n=2 can hold two particles. So the ground state would have all four particles in the lowest two n levels.

Wait, but wait, each n can have two particles (since spin up and down). So for four particles, the first two n's (n=1 and n=2) would be filled, each with two particles. Let me think: n=1 with spin up and down (two particles), n=2 with spin up and down (two particles). That adds up to four.

No, wait, but no. Wait, each n can hold two particles with opposite spins. So n=1: two particles (up and down). n=2: two more (up and down). So all four are in n=1 and n=2 levels.

Wait, but that would mean the energies are E1 + E2 + E1 + E2? No, no. Wait, each particle has its own energy, which is their own n squared times E. So the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of each particle.

Wait no, the total energy of the system would be the sum of the energies of each particle. So for each particle, their E is n²E. So four particles, each in some n state: E_total = sum (n_i² E) for i=1 to 4.

So for the ground state, we need the lowest possible sum of n_i². Since each n can have two particles, the four particles would fill up n=1 (two spins) and n=2 (two spins). So each of the four is in either n=1 or n=2. So two particles have n=1, two have n=2.

Thus, the total energy is (2*(1²) + 2*(2²)) * E. Which is (2*1 + 2*4) E = (2 +8) E =10 E.

Wait, but wait. That can't be right. Because in the options, option C has 4E as the first value, which is the ground state. Wait, maybe I got this wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of each particle's state. Since each n can have two particles (spin up and down), the ground state would have the lowest possible n's filled. So the first two particles go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the four particles are in n=1,1,2,2.

So the energies for each would be 1² E, 1² E, 2² E, 2² E. Summing them: 1+1+4+4 = 10. So total energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait. No, the problem is about the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. Oh wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system". So the system's energy in each state.

But wait, in the ground state, the four particles are arranged such that the sum of their energies is the minimum possible. So n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So sum is 2*(1² + 2²) E = 2*(1+4) E = 10 E.

Wait, but wait, no. Actually, each n can take two particles. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. So the energies are 1² E, 1² E, 2² E, 2² E. So sum is 1 +1 +4 +4 =10, multiplied by E gives 10E.

So the ground state energy is 10E. But wait, looking at the options, option C has ground state as 4E. Hmm, that can't be, unless I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. Maybe each particle's state is considered, and the total system's energy is the sum of each individual's energy.

Wait, but when you have four particles, each in a state with their own n. So the lowest energy is when as many as possible are in the lowest n.

Wait, another approach: for four identical fermions, each with spin-1/2, in a 1D box.

In the ground state, the lowest possible states are filled. Because each n can hold two particles (with opposite spins), so putting two in n=1 and two in n=2 would give the ground state. So their energies are 1²E, 1²E, 2²E, 2²E.

So sum is 1 +1 +4 +4 =10; so total energy is 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the first option. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 30E, 39E, 50E.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option C:4E,10E,15E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, so the ground state is 10E, but in option B, option C, and option D, the first value is 4E, 4E, or 10E.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm not considering that the particles are spin-1/2, so each can be in a spin-up or spin-down state. So for each n, two possible spin states. So four particles would take the first two n levels, but perhaps in a different way.

Wait, but maybe the ground state is when all four are in n=1, but that's impossible because each n can hold only two particles (since spin up and down). So the first two particles are in n=1, the next two would have to go into n=2.

Wait, but no, because each n can only hold two particles, so for four, you need two n's: n=1 and n=2. So the total energy is (2*(1²) + 2*(2²)) E = 2*(1 +4) E = 10 E.

So the ground state energy is 10 E. Then, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to a higher energy level, but we have to make sure the system is in the lowest possible energy with the next configuration.

Wait, but how do we get the first excited state? Let me think: the ground state has two particles in n=1 (each with spin up and down) and two in n=2 (each with spin up and down). So the next possible excitation would be to move the highest occupied state (n=2) up to n=3, but wait, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, but wait, no, because the system's energy is determined by the sum of all particles' energies. So the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement of the particles that's higher than the ground state but as low as possible.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the possible states are filled in a way that the sum of the squares is as minimal as possible beyond the ground state.

Wait, in the ground state, two particles are in n=1, two in n=2. The total is 10 E. Now, the first excited state would be when we have one of the n=2 particles promoted to a higher state, but perhaps the next available state is n=3, which is higher than n=2.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the particles can be arranged in a way that the sum is higher than 10 E but lower than other possibilities. So perhaps the first excited state would have one particle in n=3, but let's calculate the sum.

Wait, the four particles are now in n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). Sum is 1+1 +4 +9 =15 E. But wait, perhaps that's not the first excited state. Alternatively, maybe the next state is when the two particles in n=2 move to n=2 but maybe combining with another arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the possible configurations.

So, the ground state is two in n=1, two in n=2. Sum is 10 E.

The first excited state could be when one particle from n=2 moves up to n=3, and another from n=2 moves up to n=3 as well. Wait, no, because that would require four particles in n=1, 3 and 3, but wait, no, that's not possible because each n can hold two particles.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, and another stays. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, leading to three particles in n=1 and one in n=3. But wait, can that happen?

No, because each n can hold two particles. So if you have three particles in n=1, that's impossible because n=1 can only hold two (spin up and down). So the next available state is n=2, which can hold two. So perhaps, after the ground state, the next state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but another n=2 particle moves to n=3 as well. So the configuration becomes two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, but for n=2, you can't have only one, because the other could be in n=3. Wait, no, because each n can have up to two particles.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But then, what's the sum? 1^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2: 1+1+4+9=15. So the total energy is 15 E.

But wait, is there a lower energy configuration than 15 E? Let me think. What if we have three particles in n=2 and one in n=1? Wait, but n=2 can only hold two. So that's not possible. So the next possible option is to have two particles in n=1, two in n=2, and then the first excited state would be to move one up to n=3, but that would require that configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, leading to two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That sum is 1+1+4+9=15 E.

So then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. Let's think: after 15 E, the next state could be when two particles are in n=3, but no, because each n can hold two. So perhaps the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. But wait, that's sum 1+1+9+9=20 E.

Wait, but perhaps another configuration: three in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=2 can only hold two.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's list all possible ways to distribute four particles among the allowed n's, ensuring each n has at most two, and find the next lowest sum after 10 E.

Possible distributions:

1. Two in n=1, two in n=2 → sum = 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 10 E → ground state.

2. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 → sum = 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 2+4+9=15 E.

3. Two in n=1, two in n=3 → sum= 2*1 +2*9= 2+18=20 E.

4. One in n=1, three in n=2 → but n=2 can only hold two, so this isn't allowed.

5. One in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 → sum=1 +4*2 +9=1+8+9=18 E.

Wait, but which of these is the next higher energy after 10 E. The options given are for ground, first, and second excited states.

Wait, so the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be the next lowest sum, which is 15 E. Then the second excited state would be 18 E? Or is there a lower configuration?

Wait, let me check another possibility: three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But wait, n=1 can only hold two, so that's impossible.

So the possible next sum after 10 E is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, giving sum 15 E. So the first excited state is 15 E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has the ground state as 10E, first excited as 15E, and second excited as 18E. So option D's second excited state would be 18E.

But earlier I thought the second excited state would have two particles in n=3, giving 20E, but option D suggests 18E as the second excited state.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another possible configuration. Let me think: another configuration could be one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. So sum is 1 + (2 *4) +9 =1 +8 +9=18 E. So that's 18 E.

So the order would be:

- Ground state: 10 E.

- First excited state: 15 E.

- Second excited state: 18 E.

But looking at the options, option D says ground state is 10 E, first excited 15 E, second excited 18 E. So that would match.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3, but that would require four particles: two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 2*1 + 2*9 = 2 +18=20 E, which is higher than 15 E. So the 15 E state is lower than 20 E, so 15 E would be the first excited state, and 18 E would be the second.

Wait, but earlier I thought the configuration with two in n=1, and two in n=3 would have sum 20 E, but another configuration (one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3) would have sum 18 E. So 18 E is a lower energy than 20 E, so perhaps the order is 10 E (ground), then 15 E (first excited), then 18 E (second excited). So option D's answer would be the correct one.

But wait, in the options, option D says the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E. So that fits.

But wait, let me think again. The first excited state is the next higher energy beyond the ground state, which is 10E. The next possible would be configurations that have a sum higher than 10E but as low as possible.

So the next possible configuration is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, leading to two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The sum is 1+1+4+9=15 E.

Then, the next configuration would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so now we have two in n=1 and two in n=3. Sum is 2+18=20 E.

But wait, another configuration could be having one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Sum is 1+4*2 +9 = 1+8+9=18 E.

So 18E is higher than 15E, but lower than 20E. So the order would be:

Ground state: 10 E.

First excited state: 15 E.

Second excited state: 18 E.

So the answer would be option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Looking at the options, option D is 10E, 15E, 18E.

So the answer is D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the possible configurations of the particles. The energy levels in the well are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle applies, and each particle must occupy a unique quantum state. Each quantum number \( n \) can accommodate two particles due to the two possible spin states (spin-up and spin-down).

### Ground State:
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels. The first two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (one spin-up and one spin-down), and the next two particles occupy \( n=2 \) (one spin-up and one spin-down). The total energy is the sum of the individual energies:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted, resulting in one particle in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 1(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** \( 30E, 39E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as these values are much higher than the calculated energies.
- **Option B:** \( 4E, 10E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state energy is \( 10E \), not \( 4E \).
- **Option C:** \( 4E, 10E, 15E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state energy is \( 10E \), not \( 4E \).
- **Option D:** \( 10E, 15E, 18E \) — Correct, as it matches the calculated energies for the ground, first excited, and second excited states.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
