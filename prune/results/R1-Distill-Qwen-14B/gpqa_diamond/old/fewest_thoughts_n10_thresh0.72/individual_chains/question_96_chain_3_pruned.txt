Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let's see. The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ=1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d=1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So first, I need to find the area A.

The event horizon's radius is given by the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = (2 G M) / c². The area A would then be 4 π R_s². So A = 4 π (2 G M / c²)^2. But wait, maybe I can find A directly from the angular size.

Angular size θ is given by θ ≈ diameter / distance. Oh wait, since θ is small, we can approximate it as θ ≈ diameter / d. So the diameter is 2 R_s, so θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d. Solving for R_s gives R_s ≈ θ * d / 2.

So R_s = (θ * d) / 2. Since A = 4 π R_s², substituting R_s gives A = 4 π (θ² d²) /4 = π θ² d². Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute that. (θ * d) is roughly the diameter, so R_s = (θ * d)/2. So A is 4 π ( (θ d / 2 ) )^2 = 4 π (θ² d²) / 4 = π θ² d². Oh, that's better.

So A = π θ² d².

Now, let's plug in the numbers. θ is 1e-17 degrees, and d is 1e10 parsecs. But I need to convert these into SI units because the entropy formula uses meters and kilograms.

First, convert degrees to radians because θ is small. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is (1e-17 degrees) * (π/180) ≈ (3.1416e-19) radians.

Wait, let me compute that precisely. 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (π/180) radians. Let me calculate it: 1e-17 * (3.1416 / 180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Approximately 1.75e-19 radians.

Next, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So θ is 1.75e-19 radians, d is 3.0857e26 meters.

Now, compute A = π * θ² * d².

Let me compute θ squared: (1.75e-19)^2 = (3.0625e-38) radians squared.

d squared is (3.0857e26)^2 ≈ 9.522e52 m².

Multiply θ² and d²: 3.0625e-38 * 9.522e52 = approx 2.92e15.

Multiply by π: A ≈ π * 2.92e15 ≈ 9.17e15 m².

Wait, that seems a bit small for a supermassive black hole. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, wait, no.
