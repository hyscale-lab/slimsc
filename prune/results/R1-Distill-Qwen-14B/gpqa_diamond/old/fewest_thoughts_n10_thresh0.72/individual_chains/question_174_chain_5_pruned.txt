Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about atomic nucleus fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, mass can be converted into energy, and energy-momentum conservation must be applied.

Alright, let's read the problem again carefully. An atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, the initial nucleus is at rest, which means the total momentum after the fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. That implies the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but the rest masses sum to 99% of M. So the initial mass is M, and the two fragments have combined rest mass 0.99 M. That means there's a mass defect of 1% of M, which would be converted into kinetic energy and binding energy or something else, but I think in this case, it's kinetic energy because the problem says to ignore electrons, so probably only the kinetic energy of the fragments.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Rest mass energy of initial nucleus: Mc² = 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: mass ratio 2:1.
- Sum of rest masses: 0.99 M.

Let me denote m1 as the rest mass of the more massive fragment and m2 of the lighter one. So, m1 = 2 m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, so m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, 0.99 M, so 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, and m1 = 0.66 M. That makes sense.

Now, I need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. The problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (using relativity) and the classical (
