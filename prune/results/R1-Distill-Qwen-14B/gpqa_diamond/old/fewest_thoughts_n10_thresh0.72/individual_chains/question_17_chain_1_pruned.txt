Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca^2+. The formula for the complex would be CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, Kf, is a big number, which tells me that the complex is very stable.

Wait, the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. I think that's the formation constant. So the reaction would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- â‡Œ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca^2+].

But wait, I think in such complexes, each mole of EDTA binds one Ca^2+ ion. So the complex is 1:1. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that means initially, there's 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-.

But as the complex dissociates, some Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- will form. So let me set up the variables.

Let me denote [Ca^2+] as x, and [EDTA^4-] as y. But wait, from the complex dissociating, each mole of CaEDTA^2- would produce one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then at equilibrium:

[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = y
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x - y? Wait, actually, wait. Since each complex gives one Ca^2+ and
