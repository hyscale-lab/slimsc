Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. So, they've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means two ORFs in one vector, right? So each has its own promoter or maybe they're under different regulation.

The vector setup: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Oh wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. I remember that IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so they can be used to drive expression of a second gene in a bicistronic construct. So the ligand is under CBA, then after the IRES, the receptor is expressed. 

But wait, there are stop cassettes in between. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh, right, these are stop cassettes with loxP sites. So, when the Cre recombinase is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. 

So the ligand is under CBA, which probably is a strong promoter. The receptor is after IRES, so the same mRNA is used for both, but the ribosome would translate the ligand first, then the IRES would allow translation of the receptor. Without Cre, the stop cassettes block the expression of mCherry and eGFP, I think. Because the ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. So normally, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Same for the receptor and eGFPâ€”only when the stop is removed by Cre.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression on Western blot. But when they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes, they used total proteins with actin loading. So did they see both mCherry and eGFP? Or not? Not sure, but let's proceed.

They made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under SOX10 promoter, so it's active in neural crest cells. The offspring would have the construct and the Cre. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They look for green signal, which I think is from eGFP. But they don't see any. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, they'd be autocrine. If they're in different cells, then the ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere. But the question is about whether the proteins are expressed. The Western blot probably checked for expression, but in the live mice, if the eGFP isn't expressed, maybe the construct isn't active. But the problem is about why the eGFP isn't showing up. Maybe the expression isn't happening.

Option B: receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So no trafficking to the cell surface. But the antibodies were used in Western blot, so they probably saw the proteins if they were expressed. But in the mouse model, maybe the expression isn't happening. Or maybe in the Western, they saw the proteins but in the live mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. Not sure yet.

Option C: enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The CBA promoter is probably a strong constitutive promoter. So if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't high enough. But wait, in the Western blot, they probably used the CBA promoter to express the ligand, so the expression would be active. Unless the enhancer is something else. Or maybe the issue is that the IRES isn't working without an enhancer. Not sure. 

Option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're in the same ORF, being out of frame would cause a frameshift, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein. But in the vector, the receptor ORF is followed by eGFP. Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector where the ligand is first, then the receptor. The stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is not properly removed, the eGFP won't be expressed. But in the presence of Cre, the stop should be excised. Oh wait, the construct is in a mouse model. They're homozygous for the construct, so maybe the Cre is not active in the cells where the construct is expressed. Since they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which would activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells. So the Cre should excise the loxP and lox2272 sites. 

Wait, the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. So for loxP, you need Cre to excise it, and lox2272 requires Cre as well but maybe with a different recognition site. So the mCherry is after the ligand ORF, but the stop cassette is in between. So Cre would excise the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed as a fusion. Similarly, Cre would excise the stop between receptor and eGFP, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the mouse, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is only active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stop cassettes should be excised, allowing both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed. But in the visualization, the eGFP isn't showing. So why?

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning the same mRNA is used for both ligand and receptor. So the mRNA has both ORFs. Without Cre, the mCherry and eGFP are blocked. With Cre,
