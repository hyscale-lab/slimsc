Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay, which equals c times S. Here, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). My task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which of the given statements is correct.

Hmm, so first, I think I should write down the matrix Ay. Since S is given, and c is h/(4π), Ay is c multiplied by S. Let me compute that.

The matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying each element by c, so Ay becomes:
[ c*0   c*(-i) ] => [ 0, -i c ]
[ c*i   c*0   ] => [ i c, 0 ]

Substituting c = h/(4π), so Ay is:
[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) would be:
[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h^2)/(16π²) ) ]

Wait, let's compute the product term. (-i)*(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (h²)/(16π²) * 1.

So determinant equation:
a² - [ (h²)/(16π²) ] = 0
=> a² = h²/(16π²)
=> a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but wait—hold on. The eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π) ?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the S matrix is actually related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right! The Pauli Y matrix is the same as S here. Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches S.

And I remember that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Since S is the Pauli Y matrix, the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So if Ay is c multiplied by S, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (±1).

So c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1), which means a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says
