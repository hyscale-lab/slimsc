Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a genetic construct and why there's no green signal observed in the mice. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, the setup: They're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So two genes in one vector. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, often used for expression of transgenes. Then, the receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor could be expressed as a separate transcript, maybe in a different cell type or under different conditions. 

There are stop cassettes in between. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between its ORF and mCherry. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before eGFP. Oh, wait, loxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants, used for different types of recombination. 

They used Cre to excise these stops. So, for the ligand, if Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Same for the receptor and eGFP, but with the lox2272 sites. 

Now, the problem: They crossed the mouse model homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells and some other lineages. So the Cre would be expressed under SOX10's control, perhaps in those cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal microscope for green signal, which should come from eGFP. But they don't see it. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion. If they are paracrine, the ligand might be elsewhere, but I'm not sure how that affects the expression of eGFP. Maybe if the ligand isn't expressed, the receptor isn't either? But the expression should be controlled by the vector, not their interaction.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The eGFP is on the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in the Golgi, maybe it's not trafficked to the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But how would the construct affect that? Maybe if the eGFP is not correctly tagged, but the question says they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins. Wait, but in the experiment, they transfected primary astrocytes and saw Western blot signals proportional to actin, so the proteins were expressed and detected. So the expression is happening, but why under the microscope it's not green?

Wait, the Western blot was done after transfecting the vector into primary astrocytes. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So the question is about the mouse model. The mice were homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre.

Wait, the construct is a lox-Cre vector. So I think that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression of both ligand and receptor. But in the initial setup, the vector is a bicistronic construct with both ORFs. So when Cre is introduced, the cassettes are excised, and the two ORFs are expressed.

But in the mouse, if the Cre is only active in certain cells, like those expressing SOX
