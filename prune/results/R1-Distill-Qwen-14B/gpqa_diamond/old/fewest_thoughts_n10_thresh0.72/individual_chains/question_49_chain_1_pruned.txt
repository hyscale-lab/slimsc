Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with sigmatropic rearrangements, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three different reactions, and I need to figure out what products A, B, and C are, then match them to the options given. Let's take each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form A.

Hmm, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw that structure. It's an amine where the nitrogen is attached to two methoxy groups and an ethyl group (since ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the first carbon? Wait, no, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2? No, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So maybe it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So the structure would be (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Or maybe OCH2CH2NH2 with two methoxys on the same carbon as the amine? Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So the first carbon is the one attached to the amine. So that would be NH2CH(CH3O)2? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3 with the amine on the first carbon, so structure is NH2-CH2-CH3. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So the first carbon is CH2, but with two OMe groups? Oh wait, that's not possible because a carbon can't
