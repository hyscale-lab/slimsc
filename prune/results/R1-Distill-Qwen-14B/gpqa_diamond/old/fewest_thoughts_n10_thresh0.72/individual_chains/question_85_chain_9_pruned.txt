Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Oh right, the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Or was it (1 - albedo) to the 0.25 power? I think so, because the planet absorbs (1 - albedo) times the incident radiation.

But wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo. So the albedo term will cancel out when taking the ratio. That's good, simplifies things.

Now, the question gives me data from both transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, because the transit method gives the planet's radius (from the dip in starlight), and the radial velocity gives the mass (from the Doppler shift).

Wait, but how do I get the orbital distances (semi-major axes) of the planets? Because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance. The question doesn't directly give the distances, so I must find them using the RV method data.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and its distance. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_star) )^(1/3) * sin(i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) 

Wait, but in this case, the problem states that both planets are detected via RV. The RV shift given is the Doppler shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

Wait, but how do I relate the Doppler shift to the orbital parameters?

I recall that the Doppler velocity semi-amplitude K can be calculated using the formula:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G *
