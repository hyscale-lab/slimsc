Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

So, the problem says that there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200°C without air, which probably means it's in an inert atmosphere or under conditions where oxygen isn't present. When they did this, they got a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through three tubes: the first with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper.

The results were: the first tube (Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60 grams, the third tube (copper) gained 0.80 grams, and the second tube (Ca(OH)2) didn't change. Then, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). I think STP is 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L would be 0.1 moles.

I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Wait, let me think about what's happening here. When the salts are heated, they decompose into gases. The setup with the tubes is probably for gas analysis. 

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent. So if the gas is moisture, Mg(ClO4)2 would trap water. But wait, the weight increased by 3.60g. Hmm, Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with water: Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·H2O. So the weight gain is due to water (H2O) in the gas mixture. So 3.60g is the mass of water. 

Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so when it absorbs water, it gains mass equal to the mass of water. Let me calculate how much water that is. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O. So the gas mixture contains 0.2 moles of water vapor.

Then, the third tube is red-hot copper. The copper is probably for reacting with gases containing oxygen. When copper is hot, it can react with CO2, I think. Let me recall: red-hot copper in the presence of CO2 can form CuO and CO. But wait, the problem says that the weight of tube 3 increased by 0.80g, and CuO is formed. So whatever gas passed through reacted with the copper to form CuO.

The reaction is: 2Cu + CO2 → 2CuO + C (carbon). Wait, but the amount of Cu
