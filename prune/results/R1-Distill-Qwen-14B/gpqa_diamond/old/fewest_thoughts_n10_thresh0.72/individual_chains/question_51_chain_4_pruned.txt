Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me try to think through this.

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to calculate the net potential energy of this system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... I remember that when you bring charges together, their potential energy depends on their interaction. But here, the sphere is conducting and grounded, which probably means it's at zero potential. Oh right, because grounding allows charges to flow until the potential is the same as the Earth, which is considered zero.

So, when a charge q is placed near the sphere, there will be induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting, the charges will redistribute. The induced charges will be opposite in sign to q if it's positive, I think. Because the conductor will try to cancel the electric field inside it, so charges will move to the surface.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges can flow in or out. Let me think: when you place a charge q near a conducting sphere, the sphere's free electrons will rearrange. If q is positive, the electrons (negative charges) are attracted towards the near side, and perhaps some may leave the sphere through the ground. Or does the sphere remain neutral overall? Because if the sphere is conducting and grounded, the charge on it can change.

Wait, no,
