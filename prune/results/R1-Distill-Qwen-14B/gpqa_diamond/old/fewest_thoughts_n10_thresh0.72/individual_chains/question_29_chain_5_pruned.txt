Okay, so I've got this problem about barley and some gene mutations. Let me try to break this down. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene in each. The changes are in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So probably, the gene product (maybe an enzyme) is synthesizing this compound. If we disrupt the gene's function, the compound won't be made.

Looking at the sequences, I need to see where the changes are and what kind of mutations they are. The problem shows the wild-type (intact) gene sequence and four mutants.

The wild-type sequence starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let me compare each mutant.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, so in the first part, let's look for changes. The first part is the beginning of the sequence. Let's compare each nucleotide.

Looking at the first few bases:

Wild type: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, let me line them up.

Wild: ATGTTT CTCGCT GGTACT TCTGTG GATGAA CATATT TATGTC GT...

Mutant1: ATGTT C T ACGC TGGTACT TCTGTG GATGAA CATATT TATGTCG C...

Wait, perhaps looking at the exact positions. Let me index the changes.

Looking at the first exon, suppose the first part is:

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, positions 3-6: Wild is TTT C; Mutant1 is TCT A. Wait, let me count letters.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the sequences in parts.

Wild type starts with:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT GTG T...

Mutant1:

ATG TCT ACG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Let me compare each position.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where the nucleotides differ.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: 5’-AT
