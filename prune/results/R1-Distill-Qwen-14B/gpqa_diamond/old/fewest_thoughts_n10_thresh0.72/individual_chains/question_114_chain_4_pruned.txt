Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I need to think about what kind of reactions these are. Let me break them down one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanone plus cyanide? Oh, that sounds like a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones usually undergo nucleophilic addition, right? So maybe this is a cyanide adding to the ketone.

But wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, like NaCN, under certain conditions, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a nitrile group adds to a carbonyl group, and a hydroxyl group is added as well. So the product would have both an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon. That makes sense with the product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation.

Now, what conditions are needed for that? Cyanide is a nucleophile, but I think the reaction might require some acid catalysis. Because in the cyanohydrin formation, the carbonyl is protonated to make it more electrophilic, so the cyanide can attack. So the reagent A in this case must be an acid. Looking at the options, some of the choices have H3O+ as reagent A.

So for the first reaction, A is likely H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with B (which is H2O). The product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, nitriles hydrolyzing to
