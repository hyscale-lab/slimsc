Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the uncertainty principle applied to an electron. It says the electron is moving at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. We need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE.

Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact form. Oh right, I think the principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at least ħ over 2, but sometimes people just approximate it as ħ. So maybe I can use Δx * Δp ≈ ħ.

But wait, the question asks about the uncertainty in energy. Oh right! Because in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Because the energy of a particle is given by E = p²/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if there's an uncertainty in momentum, that leads to an uncertainty in energy.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using Δx and the uncertainty principle.
2. Use Δp to find the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).

Let me jot
