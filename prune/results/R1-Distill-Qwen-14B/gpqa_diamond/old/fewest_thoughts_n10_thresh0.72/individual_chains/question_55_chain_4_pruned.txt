Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me look at the NMR data provided. The chemicals are at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets?), 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet), and 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet). 

I remember that in NMR, the singlet at around 2.1 ppm with 3H is likely a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe like an acetate's methyl. So that's probably the OAc group, which is common in acetates. So the compound is an acetate, which fits all the options given since they're all propenyl or butenyl acetates.

Next, looking at the other peaks. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant J of 16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling, so this is probably due to a trans coupling between two double bonds, maybe in a trans configuration. Wait, but wait. Alternatively, in an allylic system, like in an enol or something, but I'm not sure. Also, 7.0 ppm is in the aromatic region, but wait, these are propenyl and butenyl groups, which are alkenes, not benzene rings. So maybe it's a vinyl proton?

Wait, but in an acetate, the ester group is OAc attached to an R group. So R is either propenyl or butenyl, and whether they are cis or trans.

Let me think about the structure of these compounds. For example, propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait no, wait. Acetate is OAc-O-R, so R is an alkene. So for propenyl acetate, R would be CH2CHCH2 or similar?

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, and butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, the substituents
