Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, does that mean stars with V less than or equal to 17? Because higher magnitude means dimmer. Oh right, because lower numbers are brighter. So ESPRESSO can handle stars up to V=17, but any brighter than that (lower mag number) would be too bright? Or wait, no—wait, I think they can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So if a star is brighter (lower V), say V=16, ESPRESSO can observe it. Because a star brighter than 17 would be V ≤17? Wait, no, that's confusing. Let me clarify.

The question states: With ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, "brighter than 17" would mean V < 17, right? Because higher magnitudes are dimmer. So if a star is brighter than 17, its V is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars where V ≤17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So that would be V <16. So any star with V magnitude less than 16 can be seen by HIRES, and stars up to V=17 can be seen by ESPRESSO.

So, a star that's less than or equal to 16 can be detected by both, right? Because HIRES can handle up to 16, and ESPRESSO up to 17. So any star with V <16 can be seen by both. But stars with V between 16 and 17 can only be seen by ESPRESSO. So the star must be V ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO and also needs to be V ≤16 to be seen by HIRES. Wait, no—if a star is V=16.5, then HIRES can't see it (since it's brighter than 16), but ESPRESSO can.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" by ESPRESSO. So stars brighter than 17 (V <17) can be observed. So stars with V=16.5 are brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see them. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 (V <16). So HIRES can't see V=16.5. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be
