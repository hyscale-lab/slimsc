Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about an electron traveling at a certain speed, and we're given the uncertainty in its position. They ask us to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy. Hmm, right. I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from my notes. Let me think.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The principle is often written as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but how does this relate to energy? Oh right, because energy and momentum are related, especially for particles moving at non-relativistic speeds. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if we have uncertainty in momentum, Δp, then the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE can be approximated by the derivative of E with respect to p, multiplied by Δp. But maybe for an order of magnitude estimate, we can use ΔE ≈ (p Δp)/(m). Or wait, perhaps it's better to express ΔE in terms of Δp.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the uncertainty principle to find Δp and then use that to find ΔE.

Given that Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. The speed v is 2e8 m/s. Wait, but for the uncertainty in momentum, I think we can relate it to the uncertainty in velocity. Because p = mv, so Δp = m Δv. But wait, no, because velocity itself has an uncertainty. Alternatively, since the problem gives the speed, but not the uncertainty in speed, perhaps we can make a simplifying assumption. Maybe the uncertainty in momentum is m times the uncertainty in velocity, assuming that Δv is roughly the same as v. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just use the Heisenberg uncertainty relation to find Δp.

So let's start with the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. Since the question says 'minimum uncertainty', we can take the equality as Δx * Δp = ħ/2. So solving for Δp gives
