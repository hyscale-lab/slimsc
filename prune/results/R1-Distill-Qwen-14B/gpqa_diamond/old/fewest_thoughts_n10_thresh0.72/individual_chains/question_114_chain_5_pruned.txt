Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (from NaCN), it's probably undergoing a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. But wait, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Oh, wait! So maybe it's a substitution reaction. Or perhaps it's a ketone reacting with a cyanide to form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a nitrile and an alcohol group are added to the carbonyl carbon. So the product here, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, would come from adding CN- and OH- to the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but in the presence of what reagents? For cyanohydrin formation, I remember that the reaction typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. Like, H3O+ is a common proton source. So reagent A should be H3O+ (protonating the carbonyl oxygen to make it a better electrophile), which would be option A or B.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is a nitrile (the -CN group) attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group (the 2-hydroxy part). And the product is a carboxylic acid. So how do nitriles become carboxylic acids? I think typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. But wait, waitâ€”another thought: if the nitrile is adjacent to an alcohol group, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of hydrolysis. Oh, but wait, the product has a carboxylic acid group. So the nitrile must have been hydrolyzed.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis usually requires specific conditions. For example, acidic hydrolysis of nitriles typically uses H2SO4 and water, perhaps with heat. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it might form a carboxylate which is then acidified. But in this case, the reagent B is something that, when added with H2O, gives the acid.

Wait, looking at the product, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile group (-CN) is converting to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). That's the typical hydrolysis of nitriles to acids.

So, how is that done? Let me think. The standard way to hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids is under acidic conditions. For example, using H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid) and heating with water. Alternatively, sometimes HCl is used in such reactions. But wait, looking at the options for B, the choices are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait another thing: sometimes, when a nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, like in a glycol nitrile, the hydrolysis can proceed more readily. But in this case, the nitrile is part of a larger molecule with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis that requires acid catalysis.

Wait, but the reaction is with H2O and reagent B. So for the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl or another acid. Let me remember: nitriles can be hydrolyzed in acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. So HCl might act as a catalyst here, providing H+ ions.

Alternatively, sometimes, for hydrolysis of nitriles, especially under acidic conditions, you might use H2O and a strong acid like HCl. So in that case, B would be HCl, which is option A or C.

Wait, let's look at the options again. The options for reagent A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. The options for B are HCl or CH3COOH.

So back to the first reaction. If the first reaction uses H3O+, then that's for the cyanohydrin formation. So A would be H3O+.

So for the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+ (protonating the ketone), allowing the CN- to attack the carbonyl carbon. Then the product is the cyanohydrin.

Now, the second reaction involves the nitrile group being converted to a carboxylic acid. So for that, you need hydrolysis. Let me think about the conditions. If reagent B is HCl, then perhaps in the presence of water, H+ from HCl would facilitate the
