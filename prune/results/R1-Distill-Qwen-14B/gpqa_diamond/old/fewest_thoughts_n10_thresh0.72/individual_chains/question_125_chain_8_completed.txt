Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, this is the harmonic oscillator, so the force is like a Hooke's law kind of thing, F = -kr, but in this case, k would be mω².

The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different energy and a different number of eigenfunctions.

Wait, I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator are quantized. And because it's isotropic, the potential depends only on r, the radial distance. So the energy depends on the quantum numbers in each direction. But in 3D, I think the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, right. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Alternatively, since the system is spherically symmetric, it's more convenient to use the quantum numbers in terms of the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum l. Or wait, no, maybe in 3D harmonic oscillator, it's more about the number of quanta in each direction.

Alternatively, I think the energy can also be written as E = ħω( n + 3/2 ), where n is a non-negative integer. Wait no, that can't be right because in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers. Because each direction contributes n_i + 1/2, so the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the quantum numbers. So each direction (x, y, z) has its own quantum number, n_x, n_y, n_z, which are 0,1,2,... The energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, I also remember that in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are equally spaced in terms of the quantum numbers. So each state is characterized by the total number of quanta N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy levels are E = ħω (N + 3/2 ), where N can be 0,1,2,... So for N=0, E = 3/2 ħω. Then N=1, E=5/2 ħω, N=2, E=7/2 ħω, and so on.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. Excited states are counted starting from the ground state as the lowest energy. So the ground state would be the first state, then first excited, second excited, third excited, etc.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0. The first excited state would be the next higher energy, which is N=1. The second excited state is N=2, and the third excited state is N=3. So the third excited state corresponds to N=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω? Wait, no. Wait, E = (N + 3/2) ħω. Because when N=0 (ground state), it's 3/2 ħω. Then N=1: 5/2, N=2: 7/2, N=3: 9/2. So, the third excited state is N=3, so E = (3 + 3/2) = 9/2 ħω.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, right? That's the first part of the question.

Now the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that same energy eigenvalue. So, for each N, the number of eigenfunctions (the degeneracy) is the number of ways to write N as a sum of three non-negative integers: n_x + n_y + n_z = N. So for each N, the degeneracy is (N + 2 choose 2) = (N+2)(N+1)/2. Because it's a combination with repetition problem: how many ways can you choose n_x, n_y, n_z such that their sum is N.

Wait, let me think. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N is equal to (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (N+2 choose 2) = (N+2)(N+1)/2.

So for N=3, the degeneracy is (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So degeneracy is 10. That means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions with energy (9/2) ħω.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the angular momentum quantum number l. Because in a 3D harmonic oscillator, the states can also be characterized by the quantum numbers n and l, where n is the principal quantum number, and l is the angular momentum quantum number.

Wait, no. I think in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on the total N = 2n + l, where n is like the radial quantum number. Because each radial level contributes to N. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are the same as the ones in the hydrogen atom, but that's probably not the case here. Wait, no, the hydrogen atom's energy depends on the principal quantum number n, but this is a harmonic oscillator.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The 3D harmonic oscillator is a system where the potential is quadratic in r, so the solutions are products of 1D harmonic oscillator solutions. So the eigenfunctions are products of x, y, z states.

So for each state, the quantum numbers in x, y, z determine the energy. Each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so summing, the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, as I thought before.

So the energy depends on N = n_x + n_y + n_z.

So for each N, the number of states is the number of ways to write N as sum of three non-negative integers. That's (N+2 choose 2). For N=3, that's (5 choose 2) = 10 ways. So the degeneracy is 10.

Therefore, the third excited state has energy (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10 → seems correct.
Option B: 11 π² ħ²/(2 m r²), 10 → energy doesn't look right, dimensionally either.
Option C: (9/2) ħω, 3 → degeneracy is wrong.
Option D: 11... → same as B, probably wrong.

So the correct answer should be A.


The problem involves a particle of mass \( m \) in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of such a system are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which correspond to the quanta in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right),
\]

where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The total quantum number \( N \) is defined as \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \), and the energy can also be expressed as:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( N + \frac{3}{2} \right).
\]

The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second excited state to \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( N = 3 \). For \( N = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy of each energy level \( N \) corresponds to the number of ways to distribute \( N \) quanta among the three directions \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the degeneracy is given by:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 2}{2} = \frac{(N + 2)(N + 1)}{2}.
\]

For \( N = 3 \), the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the third excited state has an energy of \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and a degeneracy of 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) is correct.
- **Option B**: The energy expression \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2} \) is dimensionally inconsistent and incorrect.
- **Option C**: While the energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) is correct, the degeneracy \( 3 \) is incorrect.
- **Option D**: The energy expression \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2} \) is incorrect, and the degeneracy \( 3 \) is also incorrect.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
