Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. So, that's a six-membered ring with one ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine, forming product 1. Wait, what's the reaction of ketones with bromine? Oh right, bromine can add to the carbonyl group. In cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is in a chair conformation, but I think adding bromine would lead to a dibromide. Because in the presence of a base maybe? Oh wait, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone reacting with bromine (Br2) probably undergoes a ketone addition. Oh wait, I think when ketones react with bromine, they form a 1,2-dibromide. Or maybe it's a different addition? Or is it more likely an allylic bromination? Wait, no, allylic is usually with HBr or NBS. Oh wait, no, wait, the cyclohexanone has a carbonyl, which is a good site for addition. So, adding bromine would perhaps form a bromohydrin? Or maybe in another condition. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a diels-alder? No, that's for dienes. Oh, maybe it's a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ketone gets brominated via an enol intermediate. Oh wait, another thought: cyclohexanone with bromine in a non-polar solvent like CCl4 could lead to a bromohydrin. Or perhaps in a different solvent... Hmm,
