Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says. 

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, and it's a bicyclic structure, right? Specifically, it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a structure that has a specific configuration. Limonene has a structure with a cyclohexene ring and an isopropenyl group attached. Oh wait, (R)-limonene is the specific enantiomer, so that's important for stereochemistry.

The first step is that this methanol solution of limonene is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. So, that's a hydrogenation reaction. Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen across double bonds. Limonene has a double bond in the cyclohexene part, I think. So, the reaction would hydrogenate the double bond, turning it into a single bond. But wait, limonene has two rings: a cyclohexene ring and a methyl group attached in a specific way. So adding hydrogen would reduce the double bond, making it a cyclohexane. So, product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene. What's the structure then? The starting structure of limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, so hydrogenation would make it a fully saturated bicyclic structure. But wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, not bicyclic. Or is it? No, wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, a bicyclic structure with a six-membered ring and a methyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with another terpene. Let me think: limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. Oh, right! So it's a norbornene structure. So when we hydrogenate it, the double bond in the norbornene (the bicyclo structure) would be hydrogenated, leading to norbornane. But wait, since it's (R) configuration, that will influence the product's configuration.

So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is norbornane with a specific stereochemistry. Now, the next step: product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (CPBA
