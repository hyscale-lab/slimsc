Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Maxwell's equations, but I'll try to think it through.

In our universe, I remember that magnets can't have isolated poles; they always come in pairs. This is due to the divergence of the magnetic field being zero. The equation is ∇·B = 0. That's one of Maxwell's equations, right? So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that means this equation would change. Because if you have isolated poles, the divergence wouldn't be zero anymore.

Wait, what's the other equation related to that? Oh right, Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me list them out quickly.

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's law for electric fields)
2. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's law for magnetism)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition)

In our universe, equation 2 says the divergence of B is zero, which prevents monopoles. So if in this other universe, monopoles exist, equation 2 would change. But how?

I think in a universe with magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 would become ∇·B = ρ_m/μ₀ or something like that. So equation 2 is definitely different.

Wait, but the question is which of Maxwell's equations are different. The options are about which equations are altered. So which Maxwell equations would change in this scenario?

In our case, equation 2 is the one about the divergence of B. So if equation 2 is different, that's one equation. Are there others?

Wait, also, I think that if monopoles exist, the other equations might have to change too. Because Maxwell's equations are a set that's consistent. For example, Faraday's law (equation 3) might get a term related to the magnetic current or something.

Wait, let me think. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the curl of E would have a contribution from the magnetic current. Because in Ampère's law, the time derivative of E contributes, but with monopoles, perhaps Faraday's law would have a similar term.

Wait, in the standard equations, Faraday's law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there's a magnetic current, maybe that equation would have an additional term. Or perhaps the curl of B would have a contribution from the magnetic current.

Alternatively, maybe the flux of E would come into play. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think about the symmetrization of Maxwell's equations when magnetic monopoles are present. I remember that when you have magnetic monopoles, you have to adjust two of Maxwell's equations. 

So, in the usual case, Gauss's law for B is ∇·
