Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light depends on the medium it's traveling through. In a vacuum, it's c, but in glass, it's slower. The index of refraction n tells us how much slower. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So do I need to consider relativistic effects here?

Oh, right! The medium is moving, so we're dealing with a scenario where the medium's motion affects the observed speed of light. Hmm, how does that work? I think this might involve the addition of velocities in special relativity, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall the velocity addition formula.

In special relativity, if an object is moving at velocity u in the frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the same direction, then the velocity u' observed in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(cÂ²)). But wait, that's for objects, not necessarily for light. Because light's speed is always c in any inertial frame, according to Einstein's postulate.

Wait a second, that changes things. If the speed of light is measured as c in all inertial frames, then regardless of the motion of the source or the medium, the observed speed remains c. But wait, that's only if the medium is not the source. Or is it?

Wait, I'm getting confused. The medium here is the glass moving at velocity v. So the glass is moving, but the light is propagating through it. So the question is, in the lab frame, what is the speed of the light beam?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the
