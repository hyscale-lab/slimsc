Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. I remember that an isotropic potential means it's the same in all directions, so the system is symmetric. 

The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential in three dimensions. So the force acting on the particle is Hooke's law, F = -kr, which makes sense because F = m a = -m ω² r, so k = m ω². 

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the terminology here. The "third excited state" — in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy level, which is the zeroth state. So the first excited state would be the first state above ground, the second excited state the next, and so on. So the third excited state would be the fourth state overall. Or wait, no, let me think again. The ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So the third excited state is n=3. But wait, in 3D, how does this numbering work?

In three dimensions, for a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. The energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. But wait, no, more accurately, each direction (x,y,z) has its own quantum number (n_x, n_y, n_z), each of which is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). The total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. 

So the energy levels are determined by the sum N = n_x + n_y
