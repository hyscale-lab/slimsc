Okay, so I have this physics question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember from my classes that the impulse approximation is a simplification where nucleons behave like free particles. Let me think about the assumptions behind that.

The question gives four options, and we need to pick which three jointly imply the impulse approximation. Let me go through each point.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So, this means the force or interaction is applied directly to each nucleon, not considering how they might influence each other through the nucleus. That makes sense for the impulse approximation because if each nucleon is treated separately, it's like they're free.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparency here probably means that when a particle interacts with the nucleus, it only interacts with one nucleon and passes through the others as if they weren't there. So, the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction. That's another key point because it assumes the nucleon is acting independently.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Oh, quarks are usually confined within nucleons, right? If they're non-relativistic, it means they move at speeds much below the speed of light. But wait, in reality, quarks are relativistic in nucleons because of the strong force. If they're non-relativistic, maybe it's easier to model them as simple particles within the nucleon, treating the nucleon as a point particle. So this assumption allows treating the nucleon as a composite without worrying about internal complexities. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, maybe it's about considering the nucleon as a single entity without internal interactions during the process—so it's approximated as a free particle.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Binding forces are the nuclear forces holding the nucleons together. If the nucleon isn't experiencing these forces during the interaction, it's treated as a free particle. That definitely fits with the impulse approximation—because in reality, the nucleon is bound, but here we ignore that.

The question is asking which assumptions together imply the "impulse" approximation. So I need to figure out which three of these points are part of that assumption.

Impulse approximation is often used in reactions where a nucleon is hit by a particle (like a photon or a pion), and the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect that interaction much. So the interaction is treated as a short, sharp "impulse" on a single nucleon.

Let me think about each assumption's role:

Assumption 1: Interaction is with individual nucleons—so each is treated separately. That's part of the impulse, because the current affects one.

Assumption 2: Nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. So other nucleons don't contribute to the interaction. That's another key point—so the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the process, treating the nucleon as free.

Assumption 3: Quarks are non-relativistic. I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe it's about treating the nucleon as a point particle, but does it directly impact the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation is more about the external interactions, not the internal structure of the nucleon. So perhaps this isn't a necessary assumption for the impulse itself, but might be part of a different approximation, like the shell model or something else.

Assumption 4: No binding forces. So the nucleon isn't experiencing any force from being bound in the nucleus. That seems crucial because if it's bound, its motion would involve other nucleons. Ignoring binding forces makes it behave like a free particle.

So the four assumptions, which three make the impulse?

Looking at the options:

Option A is 1,2,4: Which excludes 3. That would include the interaction only with individual nucleons, the nucleus being transparent except for the selected nucleon, and no binding forces. That seems likely because those three points are directly related to treating the nucleon as free and not considering interactions beyond a single point.

Option B is 2,3,4. So includes transparency, quarks non-relativistic, and no binding. I'm not sure about the relevance of 3 here.

Option C is 1,2,3. That includes interaction with individual, transparency, and quarks non-relativistic. But without 4, which is about binding forces. Hmm, without considering binding forces, the nucleon might not be treated as free.

Option D is 1,3,4. That includes interaction with individual, quarks non-relativistic, and no binding. But without 2, the transparency assumption. So the other nucleons might still affect the interaction.

Wait, but the question says which assumptions jointly imply the approximation. So without 2, would the nucleus not being transparent affect the impulse approximation? Because if other nucleons aren't transparent, meaning they could have some effect on the interaction, then the impulse approximation may not hold.

In the impulse approximation, you assume that the rest of the nucleus doesn't influence the interaction; that's the 'transparency' assumption, which is point 2. So without 2, the other points might not all apply.

So looking again, the correct assumptions should include 1 (interaction
