Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Cope rearrangement. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question presents two different reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B based on the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for A and B.

First, looking at the first part of the problem. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reaction conditions are BuLi followed by H+.

Wait, BuLi is a strong base, right? It's usually used for deprotonation. But in this context, maybe it's used to form a conjugate base, which could then undergo some kind of rearrangement. Oh, wait, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs under heat or light for 1,5-dienes. But here, we have BuLi, which is a strong base, so maybe this is a variation or perhaps the formation of a diradical or some intermediate.

Wait, the starting molecule is an ether with a butenyl group. The structure is a benzene ring attached to an OCH2 group, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-enyl group. So the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, let me draw it. The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is OCH2 connected to CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, attached to benzene.

Wait, no, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond starting at position 2. Wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3, but that's buta-2,3-diene? Wait, no, but-2-en-
