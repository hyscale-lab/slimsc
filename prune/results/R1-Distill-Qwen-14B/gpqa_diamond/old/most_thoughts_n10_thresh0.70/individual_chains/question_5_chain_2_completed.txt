Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They've provided the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Hmm, wait, wait. So the operator P is a vector operator, right? So I think that the actual operator we're considering is P · n̂, since the direction is arbitrary n in the x-z plane. Oh right, because the operator along an arbitrary direction would be the dot product of the vector P (which has components Px, Py, Pz) and the unit vector n̂ in the direction of interest.

So first, I should figure out what n̂ is. Since it's in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be written as (x, 0, z). But it's a unit vector, so x² + z² =1. So let me denote n̂ as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe it's more standard to use θ from the z-axis, but sometimes people use φ. Hmm. Well, regardless, the form will be (cosθ, 0, sinθ) assuming θ is from the z-axis.

Okay, so the operator P·n̂ will be Px * cosθ + Pz * sinθ, because Py is multiplied by zero. So the matrix for P·n̂ is (ħ/2) [ cosθ * Px_matrix + sinθ * Pz_matrix ].

Wait, let me get the matrices right. From the problem statement:

Px is ħ/2 times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So that's the Pauli x matrix, right? Similarly, Py is ħ/2 times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli y matrix multiplied by ħ/2. And Pz is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli z matrix times ħ/2.

So, putting it together, the operator P·n̂ is (ħ/2) [ cosθ * σx + sinθ * σz ].

Since σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ * 0 + sinθ * 1, cosθ * 1 + sinθ * 0 ],
          [cosθ * 1 + sinθ * 0, cosθ * 0 + sinθ * (-1) ] ]

So simplifying that, it's:

(ħ/2) * [ [ sinθ, cosθ ],
           [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

Wait, let me compute each element:

Top left: cosθ * σx's (1,1) element is zero, plus sinθ * σz's (1,1) element is 1. So top left is sinθ * (ħ/2).

Top right: cosθ * σx's (1,2) is 1, plus sinθ * σz's (1,2) is 0. So top right is cosθ * (ħ/2).

Similarly, bottom left: cosθ * σx's (2,1) is 1, sinθ * σz's (2,1) is 0. So bottom left is cosθ * (ħ/2).

Bottom right: cosθ * σx's (2,2) is 0, plus sinθ * σz's (2,2) is -1. So bottom right is - sinθ * (ħ/2).

So the matrix is:

ħ/2 * [ [ sinθ, cosθ ],
         [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate:

The general P·n̂ = (Px cosθ + Pz sinθ) * (ħ/2).

Because n̂ is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), right? So P·n̂ = Px cosθ + Py * 0 + Pz sinθ. Oh wait, wait, n̂ is (x, y, z) = (cosθ, 0, sinθ), since in x-z plane, y is zero. So yeah, the dot product is Px * x + Py * y + Pz * z. So that is Px cosθ + Pz sinθ.

But Px is (ħ/2) σx, and Pz is (ħ/2) σz. So P·n̂ is (ħ/2) [ cosθ σx + sinθ σz ].

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Multiplying this out, each term:

cosθ * σx = [[0, cosθ], [cosθ, 0]]

sinθ * σz = [[sinθ, 0], [0, -sinθ]]

Adding these together:

[[sinθ, cosθ], [cosθ, - sinθ]]

So the matrix for P·n̂ is (ħ/2) multiplied by that, so each element is (ħ/2) times the above.

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) sinθ, (ħ/2) cosθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) cosθ, -(ħ/2) sinθ ] ]

Now, we are to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvalue equation is (P·n̂) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

( P·n̂ ) |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So, substituting the matrix, we can set up the equation:

( (ħ/2) sinθ ) v1 + ( (ħ/2) cosθ ) v2 = (ħ/2) v1

( (ħ/2) cosθ ) v1 + ( -(ħ/2) sinθ ) v2 = (ħ/2) v2

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2), as it's non-zero, so:

Equation 1: sinθ v1 + cosθ v2 = v1

Equation 2: cosθ v1 - sinθ v2 = v2

Let's rearrange Equation 1:

sinθ v1 + cosθ v2 = v1 → (sinθ - 1) v1 + cosθ v2 = 0 → Equation A: (sinθ -1 ) v1 + cosθ v2 = 0

Equation 2: cosθ v1 - sinθ v2 = v2 → cosθ v1 = (1 + sinθ) v2 → Equation B: cosθ v1 = (1 + sinθ) v2

We can express v1 from Equation B: v1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] v2.

But wait, let me check that.

From Equation B: cosθ v1 = (1 + sinθ) v2 → v1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] v2.

Assuming cosθ is not zero. But if cosθ is zero, then theta is 90 degrees, but then we can handle that case separately. But let's proceed for now, assuming cosθ ≠ 0.

Substitute v1 into Equation A:

(sinθ -1 ) [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ v2 ] + cosθ v2 = 0

Multiply through:

[ (sinθ -1)(1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] v2 + cosθ v2 = 0

Let me compute the first term numerator: (sinθ -1)(1 + sinθ) = (sinθ)^2 - 1^2 = - (1 - sin²θ) = -cos²θ

So the first term becomes [ - cos²θ / cosθ ] v2 = - cosθ v2.

So the equation becomes:

- cosθ v2 + cosθ v2 = 0 → 0 = 0.

Hmm, which is always true. So that means that the two equations are not independent; they're the same, so we have one equation.

So, from Equation B, v1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] v2.

So the eigenvector can be written in terms of v2. Let me denote v2 = a, then v1 = [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ] a.

But we need to normalize the eigenvector.

So the eigenvector is:

v = [ v1, v2 ] = [ ( (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ) a , a ].

To find the normalized vector, we compute the normalization condition:

|v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

Assuming that a is a complex number, but since the eigenvector can be complex, but considering that the operator is Hermitian, the eigenvectors can be chosen real or with specific phases. But perhaps the problem assumes a real eigenvector. Hmm, maybe. Let's proceed.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the eigenvectors of spin operators. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvectors of the spin component along a direction are typically expressed as vectors with components proportional to cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), but let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps using the standard spin-up state along direction n. The eigenvector for eigenvalue +1/2 (times ħ) would be something like [ cosθ/2, e^{iφ} sinθ/2 ]^T, but since in this problem φ is zero because n lies in the x-z plane, so φ is zero. Therefore, the components would be real.

Wait, but in this problem, we're dealing with a muon, but muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so the same spin-1/2 formalism applies.

Wait, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the spin-up state along direction n. The general form is:

|+n> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so it's [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but let me double-check that. The standard parametrization for a spin-1/2 state aligned along (θ, φ) is:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ].

Yes, that's right. So in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so the state is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, let me think about the direction. The angle θ is measured from the z-axis, so when θ is 0, the vector is along +z. So the state would be [1, 0], which makes sense.

But in our problem, the eigenvector equation yielded v1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] v2.

Let me express this as v1/v2 = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

But wait, from the standard spin state, v1/v2 = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2).

So if I can show that (1 + sinθ)/cosθ equals cot(θ/2), then that would match.

Let's see:

(1 + sinθ) / cosθ = [ (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))^2 ] / [ cos^2(θ/2) - sin^2(θ/2) ) ]

Wait, perhaps a better approach: using trigonometric identities.

Let me compute (1 + sinθ) / cosθ.

1 + sinθ = sin(π/2) + sinθ = 2 sin( (π/4 + θ/2) ) cos( (π/4 - θ/2) )

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me write 1 + sinθ as 2 sin²(θ/2 + π/4) or something. Alternatively, note that:

1 + sinθ = [ sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2) ]^2.

Because expanding [a + b]^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So:

[ sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2) ]^2 = sin²(θ/2) + 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) + cos²(θ/2) = 1 + sinθ.

Yes, correct, because 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = sinθ.

So 1 + sinθ = [ sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2) ]^2.

And cosθ = cos^2(θ/2) - sin^2(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2)][cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2)].

So let's compute (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

= [ (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))^2 ] / [ (cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2))(cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2)) ) ]

The denominator has (cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2))(cos(θ/2)+ sin(θ/2)) ) = cos²(θ/2) - sin²(θ/2) = cosθ.

So, (1 + sinθ)/cosθ = [ (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))^2 ] / [ (cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2))(cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2)) ) ]

We can cancel (cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2)) from numerator and denominator:

= [ sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ] perhaps? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Let me write numerator as [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ] and denominator as [ cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2) ].

So, let me factor this ratio:

= [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2) ]

Divide numerator and denominator by cos(θ/2):

= [1 + tan(θ/2) ] / [1 - tan(θ/2) ].

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express it as tan( something ).

Let me think: [ cos a + sin a ] / [ cos a - sin a ] = [1 + tan a ] / [1 - tan a ] = tan( π/4 + a ), using the identity tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B)/(1 - tan A tan B). So if I let A = π/4 (tan A =1 ), then:

tan( π/4 + a ) = [1 + tan a ] / [1 - tan a ]

Which matches the numerator over denominator if a = θ/2.

So, [ cos a + sin a ] / [ cos a - sin a ] = tan( π/4 + a ), where a = θ/2.

So, [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2) ] = tan( π/4 + θ/2 )

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps consider that (1 + sinθ)/cosθ can be written as tan( π/4 + θ/2 ).

Let me check with θ=0:

(1 + 0)/1 =1. tan( π/4 +0 )=1. Correct.

θ= π/2:

(1 +1)/0 → infinity. tan( π/4 + π/4 )= tan(π/2) → infinity. Correct.

So yes, (1 + sinθ)/cosθ = tan( π/4 + θ/2 ).

But I'm not sure if this helps connect to the standard spin state.

Wait, the standard spin state is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

So the ratio v1/v2 is cos(θ/2)/ sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2).

But according to our earlier equation, v1/v2 = (1 + sinθ)/(cosθ) = tan( π/4 + θ/2 )

Wait, so are these ratios the same?

Wait, let me compute cot(θ/2) and see if it's equal to tan( π/4 + θ/2 ).

Cot(θ/2) = 1 / tan(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ]

And tan( π/4 + θ/2 ) = [ tan π/4 + tan(θ/2) ] / [ 1 - tan π/4 tan(θ/2) ) ] = [ 1 + tan(θ/2) ] / [ 1 - tan(θ/2) ]

Which is the same as [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, let's compute tan( π/4 + θ/2 ):

= [ tan(π/4) + tan(θ/2) ] / [ 1 - tan(π/4) tan(θ/2) ]

= [ 1 + tan(θ/2) ] / [ 1 - tan(θ/2) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by cos(θ/2):

= [ cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2) ]

Which is the same as (1 + sinθ)/cosθ, since:

(1 + sinθ) = (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))^2

cosθ = (cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2))(cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2)) )

So, (1 + sinθ)/cosθ = [ (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))^2 ] / [ (cos(θ/2)^2 - sin(θ/2)^2 ) ]

Which simplifies to [ (sin + cos)^2 ] / [ (cos - sin)(cos + sin) ) ] ⇒ (sin + cos)/(cos - sin) = [1 + tan(theta/2)]/[1 - tan(theta/2)].

Which is the same as tan( pi/4 + theta/2 ), as before.

So from our earlier equation, v1/v2 = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ = tan( pi/4 + theta/2 )

But from the standard spin state, the ratio v1/v2 is cot(theta/2 ) = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ].

So, are these two expressions the same?

Wait, let's see if tan( pi/4 + theta/2 ) equals cot(theta/2 ).

Let me compute tan(pi/4 + theta/2):

= [ tan(pi/4) + tan(theta/2) ] / [ 1 - tan(pi/4) tan(theta/2) ]

= [ 1 + t ] / [ 1 - t ], where t = tan(theta/2)

= [ 1 + t ] / [ 1 - t ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by [1 + t ]:

= [ (1 + t)^2 ] / [ (1)^2 - t^2 ) ]

= [1 + 2t + t² ] / [ 1 - t^2 ]

But cot(theta/2 )= 1 / t.

So, is [1 + 2t + t^2 ] / [1 - t^2 ] = 1/t?

Multiply both sides by t (1 - t^2 ):

t(1 + 2t + t² ) = 1 - t²

Left side: t + 2t² + t^3

Right side: 1 - t²

Bring all terms to left:

t + 2t² + t^3 -1 + t² = 0 → t^3 +3t^2 + t -1 =0.

Hmm, not sure if that's zero. Let me plug in t=1:

1 +3 +1 -1=4≠0. Not zero. So it's not equal. So this must mean that my earlier assumption is wrong, that our ratio from the equations is not the same as the standard spin state.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's think about the eigenvector of the operator P·n̂ which has eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The operator P·n̂ is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvectors can be found by solving (P·n̂ - (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0.

So, the matrix for (P·n̂ - (ħ/2) I ) is:

[ (ħ/2 sinθ - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 cosθ), 0 ],
Wait, no. Let me compute each element.

The matrix P·n̂ is (ħ/2) [ [ sinθ, cosθ ], [ cosθ, - sinθ ] ]

Subtracting (ħ/2) I, which is (ħ/2) [ [1,0], [0,1] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ (ħ/2 (sinθ -1) ), (ħ/2 cosθ ), (ħ/2 cosθ ), (ħ/2 (-sinθ -1) ) ]

So the matrix is:

[ (sinθ -1), cosθ ]
[ cosθ, (-sinθ -1) ]

All multiplied by (ħ/2), but since we're looking for the null space, the (ħ/2) factor can be factored out and ignored.

So, the system of equations is:

(sinθ -1 ) v1 + cosθ v2 = 0

cosθ v1 + (- sinθ -1 ) v2 = 0

But since sinθ -1 is (sinθ -1 ) and second equation is cosθ v1 + ( - (sinθ +1) ) v2 =0.

Let me write the first equation:

(sinθ -1 ) v1 + cosθ v2 =0 → equation 1.

The second equation:

cosθ v1 - (sinθ +1 ) v2 =0 → equation 2.

Let me solve these equations.

From equation 1: (sinθ -1 ) v1 = - cosθ v2 → v1 = [ -cosθ / (sinθ -1 ) ] v2.

Simplify denominator: sinθ -1 = -(1 - sinθ ) → so v1= [ -cosθ / ( - (1 - sinθ) ) ] v2 = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ ) ] v2.

Let me rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ ):

cosθ (1 + sinθ ) / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] = cosθ (1 + sinθ ) / (1 - sin²θ ) = cosθ (1 + sinθ ) / cos²θ = (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ.

So v1 = (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ * v2.

Which matches the earlier result. So, the ratio is (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ , 1 ]

But to make this a unit vector, we can write it as:

v = [ (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ , 1 ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

But wait, the components are v1 and v2. So v1 = [ (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ ] v2.

Let me express the vector as:

v = [ (1 + sinθ ) / cosθ , 1 ] * a, where a is a normalization constant.

The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 =1.

So:

[ (1 + sinθ )^2 / cos²θ + 1 ] * |a|^2 =1.

Compute the coefficient:

( (1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ ) + cos²θ ) / cos²θ.

Because 1 = cos²θ / cos²θ.

So,

[ 1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ + cos²θ ] / cos²θ.

But sin²θ + cos²θ =1, so numerator becomes 1 + 2 sinθ +1 = 2 (1 + sinθ ).

So,

2 (1 + sinθ ) / cos²θ * |a|^2 =1 → |a|^2 = cos²θ / (2 (1 + sinθ )).

Hmm, maybe we can simplify this.

Note that 1 + sinθ = (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2 ))^2.

And cos^2 theta = (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2 ))^2 (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2 ))^2 )

Wait, perhaps using identities.

Alternatively, note that 1 + sinθ = 2 sin( pi/4 + theta/2 ) cos( pi/4 - theta/2 ), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, using the identity 1 + sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let's compute |a|:

|a|= sqrt[ (cos²θ ) / (2 (1 + sinθ )) ) ]

= cosθ / sqrt[ 2 (1 + sinθ ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) / sqrt(1 + sinθ ):

= [ cosθ * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt( 2 (1 + sinθ )^2 ) )

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me write 1 + sinθ as ( sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) )^2.

But perhaps a better idea is to rationalize the denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sinθ ):

So,

(1 + sinθ )(1 - sinθ ) = 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So,

2 (1 + sinθ ) * (1 - sinθ ) = 2 (1 - sin²θ ) = 2 cos²θ.

So,

|a| = cos theta / sqrt(2 (1 + sin theta )) 

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sin theta )^(1/2):

= [ cos theta * sqrt(1 - sin theta ) ] / sqrt( 2 (1 + sin theta )(1 - sin theta ) )

= [ cos theta * sqrt( 1 - sin theta ) ] / sqrt( 2 cos^2 theta )

= [ cos theta * sqrt( 1 - sin theta ) ] / ( cos theta sqrt(2) )

= sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) ) / sqrt(2 )

So |a| = sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

Alternatively, |a| = sqrt( [1 - sin theta ] / 2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ (1 + sin theta )/( cos theta ) * a , a ]

Substituting a:

v1 = (1 + sin theta )/( cos theta ) * sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

v2 = sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

Simplify v1:

v1 = [ (1 + sin theta ) * sqrt(1 - sin theta ) ] / ( cos theta * sqrt(2) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):

= [ (1 + sin theta ) sqrt(1 - sin theta ) * sqrt(2) ] / ( 2 cos theta )

Wait, perhaps another approach.

We can write (1 + sin theta ) sqrt(1 - sin theta ) = sqrt( (1 + sin theta )^2 (1 - sin theta ) )

= sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) (1 + sin theta )(1 - sin theta ) )

= sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) (1 - sin² theta ) )

= sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) cos² theta )

= cos theta sqrt(1 + sin theta )

So,

v1 = [ cos theta sqrt(1 + sin theta ) ] / ( cos theta sqrt(2) ) )

The cos theta terms cancel, so:

v1 = sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, v2 = sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) ) / sqrt(2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 ) ]

Wait, wait: Wait, v1 is sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 ), v2 is sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

But wait, let me see:

Because v1 = sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 )

v2 = sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

But wait, let me compute:

v1 = [ (1 + sin theta )/( cos theta ) * a ] 
= [ (1 + sin theta ) / cos theta ] * sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

= [ (1 + sin theta ) * sqrt(1 - sin theta ) ] / ( cos theta * sqrt(2) )

Which is sqrt( (1 + sin theta )^2 (1 - sin theta ) ) / ( cos theta * sqrt(2) )

= sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) (1 - sin theta ) (1 + sin theta ) ) / ... 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me try again.

v1 = (1 + sin theta )/( cos theta ) * a

a is sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

So,

v1 = (1 + sin theta )/( cos theta ) * sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= sqrt( (1 + sin theta )^2 (1 - sin theta ) ) / ( cos theta * sqrt(2) )

Wait, (1 + sin theta ) * sqrt(1 - sin theta ) = sqrt( (1 + sin theta )^2 (1 - sin theta ) )

= sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) (1 - sin theta ) (1 + sin theta ) )

= sqrt( (1 - sin^2 theta ) (1 + sin theta ) )

= sqrt( cos^2 theta (1 + sin theta ) )

= cos theta * sqrt(1 + sin theta )

So,

v1 = [ cos theta * sqrt(1 + sin theta ) ] / ( cos theta * sqrt(2) ) 

= sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, v2 = a = sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 ) ]

But wait, let me think about this in terms of the standard spin-up state.

The standard spin-up state along direction (theta, phi) is:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2 ) ]^T.

In our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0.

So the state is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T.

But our result is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 ) ].

Wait, can we relate these two expressions?

Let me compute cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 ) squared.

cos^2(theta/2 ) = (1 + cos theta ) / 2.

sin^2(theta/2 ) = (1 - cos theta ) / 2.

Hmm, but the expressions we have involve sin theta, not cos theta.

Wait, let me express (1 + sin theta ) in terms of theta/2.

1 + sin theta = 1 + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ) 

= [ sin^2(theta/2 ) + cos^2(theta/2 ) ] + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

= [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ) ]^2.

So,

sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 ) = [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) / 2 ) = [ cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 )

So the normalized eigenvector becomes:

v = [ [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 ), [ cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

v = (1/sqrt(2)) [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ), cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2 ) ]

Hmm, but this doesn't look like the standard spin-up state, which is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the eigenvector in terms of theta/2.

Wait, another approach: since the direction is along (theta, 0), the eigenstate should be |+> = [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

So perhaps I should compare this with the eigenvector I found.

Hmm.

Wait, our result for the eigenvector is:

v = [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta )/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta )/2 ) ]

But the standard state is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Is there a relation between these two?

Let me compute the square of the components.

cos^2(theta/2 ) = (1 + cos theta ) / 2.

Hmm, but our first component is sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) /2 ).

So unless sin theta equals cos theta, which is not generally true, these components are different.

So perhaps my earlier approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the eigenvalue equation differently.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the eigenvalue equation with the matrix P·n̂.

Wait, the operator P·n̂ has the matrix:

(ħ/2) [ [ sinθ, cosθ ], [ cosθ, - sinθ ] ]

We're looking for eigenvectors with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

( P·n̂ ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So:

[ (ħ/2 sinθ ) v1 + (ħ/2 cosθ ) v2 ] = (ħ/2) v1 → (sinθ ) v1 + cosθ v2 = v1 → equation 1.

[ (ħ/2 cosθ ) v1 + ( - ħ/2 sinθ ) v2 ] = (ħ/2) v2 → cosθ v1 - sinθ v2 = v2 → equation 2.

Equation 1: (sinθ - 1) v1 + cosθ v2 = 0.

Equation 2: cosθ v1 - (sinθ + 1 ) v2 =0.

Let me write these as:

Equation 1: (sinθ - 1) v1 = - cosθ v2 → v1 = [ - cosθ / ( sinθ - 1 ) ] v2.

Equation 2: cosθ v1 = ( sinθ + 1 ) v2 → v1 = [ ( sinθ + 1 ) / cosθ ] v2.

So from the two equations, we have:

[ - cosθ / ( sinθ - 1 ) ] v2 = [ ( sinθ +1 ) / cosθ ] v2.

Assuming v2 ≠0, we can divide both sides by v2:

- cosθ/( sinθ - 1 ) = ( sinθ +1 ) / cosθ.

Multiply both sides by ( sinθ - 1 ) cosθ:

- cos^2 theta = ( sin theta +1 )( sin theta -1 )

= sin^2 theta -1 = - cos^2 theta.

So,

- cos^2 theta = - cos^2 theta.

Which is an identity. So the two equations are dependent, and we can choose v2 as a free parameter.

So, from equation 2: v1 = ( sin theta +1 ) / cos theta * v2.

So the eigenvector is [ (sin theta +1 )/ cos theta * v2, v2 ].

Let me express this as v = v2 [ (sin theta +1 )/ cos theta, 1 ].

To normalize, we compute |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = |v2|^2 [ ( (sin theta +1 )^2 / cos^2 theta ) +1 ] =1.

So,

|v2|^2 [ ( (sin theta +1 )^2 + cos^2 theta ) / cos^2 theta ) ] =1.

Compute numerator:

(sin theta +1 )^2 + cos^2 theta = sin^2 theta + 2 sin theta +1 + cos^2 theta = 2 + 2 sin theta.

Because sin^2 + cos^2 =1, so 1 + 2 sin theta +1 = 2 (1 + sin theta ).

So,

|v2|^2 * [ 2 (1 + sin theta ) / cos^2 theta ) ] =1 → |v2|^2 = cos^2 theta / [ 2 (1 + sin theta ) ]

So |v2|= cos theta / sqrt( 2 (1 + sin theta ) )

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ ( (sin theta +1 )/ cos theta ) * ( cos theta / sqrt( 2 (1 + sin theta ) ) ), ( cos theta / sqrt( 2 (1 + sin theta ) ) ) ]

Simplify each component:

v1: (sin theta +1 )/ cos theta * cos theta / sqrt(2 (1 + sin theta )) = sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 )

v2: cos theta / sqrt( 2 (1 + sin theta ) ) = sqrt( cos^2 theta ) / sqrt( 2 (1 + sin theta ) )

But cos theta = sqrt(1 - sin^2 theta ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, note that cos theta = sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) (1 + sin theta ) )

So,

v2 = sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) (1 + sin theta ) ) / sqrt( 2 (1 + sin theta ) )

= sqrt( (1 - sin theta ) ) / sqrt( 2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta )/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta )/2 ) ]

But wait a second, this is the same as earlier. How does this compare to the standard spin-up state?

The standard spin-up state is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Let me compute cos(theta/2 ) squared and sin(theta/2 ) squared.

cos^2(theta/2 ) = (1 + cos theta )/2.

sin^2(theta/2 ) = (1 - cos theta )/2.

Hmm. So our components are sqrt( (1 + sin theta )/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - sin theta )/2 ).

So if I can express these in terms of theta/2, perhaps I can see a connection.

Let me compute (1 + sin theta ) in terms of theta/2.

We know that sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

1 + sin theta = 1 + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

= [ sin^2(theta/2 ) + cos^2(theta/2 ) ] + 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )

= [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ) ]^2.

So,

sqrt( (1 + sin theta )/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Similarly,

1 - sin theta = [ cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2 ) ]^2.

So,

sqrt( (1 - sin theta )/2 ) = [ cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 ), [ cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 ) ]

Which can be written as:

v = 1/sqrt(2) [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ), cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2 ) ]

Hmm, but the standard spin-up state is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, perhaps I can factor out cos(theta/2 ) from the first component.

Wait,

sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ) ( 1 + tan(theta/2 ) )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of a rotation. Alternatively, perhaps the standard form uses a different parametrization.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvectors differ by a phase or a global factor, but the components are related.

Wait, let's compute our v1 and v2 in terms of the standard components.

The standard state is [ a, b ] = [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Our state is [ [ sin(theta/2 ) + cos(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 ), [ cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2 ) ] / sqrt(2 ) ]

Let me factor out cos(theta/2 ) from the first component and sin(theta/2 ) from the second.

= [ cos(theta/2 ) ( 1 + tan(theta/2 ) ) , sin(theta/2 ) ( 1 - tan(theta/2 ) ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the two eigenvectors are the same up to a rotation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the angle between the standard state and our calculated state.

But maybe this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just look at the options and see which one matches.

The problem is to select the correct eigenvector from the given options.

Option C is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Option B is [ cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta ]

But since phi=0 here, option B becomes [ cos theta, sin theta ]

Wait, but wait, the eigenvector components are given as vectors, but in quantum mechanics, the components are in the basis of the eigenstates, which are spin-up along z, etc.

Wait, wait, perhaps the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Which matches option C.

But wait, looking back at the earlier steps, I found that the normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta )/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta )/2 ) ]

But option C is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should re-express [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta )/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta )/2 ) ] in terms of theta/2.

We know that:

cos(theta/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + cos theta )/2 )

and

sin(theta/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - cos theta )/2 )

But in our case, the components involve sin theta, not cos theta.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express everything in terms of theta.

Wait, the standard state |+n> is [ cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2 ) ]

In our case, phi=0, so it's [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But in our calculation, the eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta )/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta )/2 ) ]

Wait, perhaps these are the same?

Let me compute for a specific theta.

Take theta=0.

Our calculated v1 = sqrt( (1 + 0 )/2 )= sqrt(1/2 )=1/√2.

v2 = sqrt( (1-0 )/2 )= 1/√2.

So the state is [ 1/√2, 1/√2 ]

The standard state for theta=0 is [ cos(0 )=1, 0 ]

But wait, this doesn't match.

Wait, that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, when theta=0, the direction is along z. The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the state [1; 0 ], because P_z is diagonal.

Wait, according to our calculation, when theta=0, the eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1+0)/2 ), sqrt( (1-0 )/2 ) ]= [ 1/√2, 1/√2 ]

But that's not correct because along z, the spin-up state is [1; 0 ].

Hmm, so that suggests that my calculation is wrong.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because when theta=0, the direction is along +z, so the eigenvector should be [1,0], not [1/√2, 1/√2 ]

So where did I go wrong?

Let me retrace. Earlier, I had the matrix P·n̂ as (ħ/2) [ [ sin theta, cos theta ], [ cos theta, - sin theta ] ]

But when theta=0, this becomes (ħ/2) [ [0,1], [1, 0 ] ] which is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

The eigenvectors for the Pauli X matrix are [1; 1]/√2 and [1; -1 ]/√2.

Which correspond to eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively, when multiplied by ħ/2.

So for theta=0, the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is [1; 1 ]/√2.

But according to the earlier calculation, when theta=0, the eigenvector is [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct.

But according to the standard spin-up state, when theta=0, the state is [1, 0].

Hmm, this suggests a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the direction of n.

Because earlier, I assumed that n is (cos theta, 0, sin theta ), measured from the z-axis.

But the standard parametrization for the spin direction is usually in spherical coordinates where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle.

But perhaps in that case, the standard spin-up state along n is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) e^{i phi } ]

So when theta=0, the state is [1; 0 ], which is correct.

But according to our calculation, when theta=0, the state is [1/√2; 1/√2 ], which is the eigenstate of sigma_x.

So that suggests that my calculation is correct, but the standard spin state is different.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem arises because the operator P·n is not the same as the spin operator S·n multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operator S is given by S = ħ/2 sigma, where sigma are the Pauli matrices.

So the operator along direction n is S·n = (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z )

Which is exactly the P·n̂ operator in this problem, since the components are P_x = (ħ/2 ) sigma_x, etc.

So, the operator P is indeed the spin operator for a spin-1/2 system.

So the eigenstates of P·n̂ with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the same as the eigenstate of S·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2, which is the spin-up state along n.

So the eigenstate should be [ cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2 ) ]

But according to our calculations, for theta=0, the state is [1/√2, 1/√2 ], which would correspond to Sx eigenstate, not Sz.

Wait, but the P·n̂ operator when n is along z is P_z = (ħ/2) sigma_z, which has eigenstates [1; 0] and [0; 1], corresponding to eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But according to our earlier calculation, when theta=0, the eigenvector is [1/√2; 1/√2 ], which is incorrect.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me try to re-express the operator P·n̂ correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix expression for P·n̂.

Wait, the operator P·n̂ is given by (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z )

But in the problem statement, the direction is along an arbitrary n in x-z plane, so n_y=0.

So P·n̂ = (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z )

But n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

So n_x = cos theta, n_z = sin theta.

Wait, wait! Wait, earlier I assumed that n is (cos theta, 0, sin theta ), but perhaps I should have defined theta as the angle from the x-axis, but no, the angle from the z-axis is the usual polar angle.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, when theta=0, the direction is along +z, so n_z=1, n_x=0.

But according to the standard spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle measured from the z-axis. So when theta=0, the direction is along +z.

So in that case, for theta=0, n_x=0, n_z=1.

So for theta=0, P·n̂ = (ħ/2) (0 * sigma_x + 1 * sigma_z ) = (ħ/2) sigma_z.

Which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, with eigenvectors [1; 0 ] and [0; 1 ].

But according to my earlier calculation, when theta=0, the eigenvector is [1/√2; 1/√2 ].

Which is clearly incorrect for the sigma_z operator.

So this suggests that my earlier approach is wrong.

Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I inverted the parametrization. Maybe in the problem, the direction is given in terms of an angle theta from the x-axis in the x-z plane, not from the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the angle phi.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the direction n lies in the x-z plane, so we can write it as (sin phi, 0, cos phi ) where phi is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, that would be: n = ( sin phi, 0, cos phi )

So when phi=0, n is along +z.

When phi= pi/2, n is along +x.

Wait, but that's a different parametrization from before.

So, perhaps I should redefine the direction.

Let me try that.

Let me define the direction n as ( sin phi, 0, cos phi ), so that when phi=0, it's along +z, and phi= pi/2, along +x.

So in this case, the components of n are:

n_x = sin phi,

n_z = cos phi,

so n = ( sin phi, 0, cos phi )

Then, the operator P·n̂ is (ħ/2)( n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z )

Which is (ħ/2) [ sin phi sigma_x + cos phi sigma_z ]

So the matrix becomes (ħ/2) times:

[ [ cos phi, sin phi ],
 [ sin phi, -cos phi ] ]

Because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Multiply them:

sigma_x * sin phi + sigma_z * cos phi = [[ cos phi, sin phi ], [ sin phi, - cos phi ] ]

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [[ cos phi, sin phi ], [ sin phi, - cos phi ] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is ( P·n̂ ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So,

(ħ/2) [ [ cos phi, sin phi ],
          [ sin phi, - cos phi ] ] [ v1, v2 ]^T = (ħ/2) [ v1, v2 ]^T.

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

[ (cos phi ) v1 + sin phi v2, sin phi v1 - cos phi v2 ]^T = [ v1, v2 ]^T.

So,

Equation 1: cos phi v1 + sin phi v2 = v1 → (cos phi -1 ) v1 + sin phi v2 =0.

Equation 2: sin phi v1 - ( cos phi +1 ) v2 =0.

Let me write equation 1: (cos phi -1 ) v1 + sin phi v2 =0.

Equation 2: sin phi v1 - ( cos phi +1 ) v2 =0.

Let me solve equation 1 for v1:

v1 = [ sin phi / ( 1 - cos phi ) ] v2.

Similarly, equation 2: v1 = [ ( cos phi +1 ) / sin phi ) ] v2.

So,

[ sin phi / (1 - cos phi ) ] v2 = [ ( cos phi +1 ) / sin phi ) ] v2.

Assuming v2≠0,

sin phi / (1 - cos phi ) = ( cos phi +1 ) / sin phi.

Multiply both sides by (1 - cos phi ) sin phi:

sin^2 phi = (1 - cos phi ) (1 + cos phi )

= 1 - cos^2 phi.

But sin^2 phi = 1 - cos^2 phi → yes, the equation holds.

So, the two equations are dependent.

Thus, the eigenvector is given by v1 = [ (1 + cos phi ) / sin phi ] v2.

Expressed as:

v = v2 [ (1 + cos phi ) / sin phi , 1 ]

To normalize,

|v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = |v2|^2 [ ( (1+cos phi )^2 / sin² phi ) +1 ] =1.

So,

|v2|^2 [ ( (1 + 2 cos phi + cos^2 phi ) + sin^2 phi ) / sin^2 phi ) ] =1.

Because,

(1 + cos phi )^2 =1 + 2 cos phi + cos^2 phi.

Adding sin^2 phi:

1 + 2 cos phi + cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi = 2(1 + cos phi )

Because cos^2 + sin^2 =1 → 1+2 cos phi +1 = 2(1 + cos phi )

So,

|v2|^2 * [ 2(1 + cos phi ) / sin^2 phi ) ] =1 → |v2|^2 = sin^2 phi / [ 2(1 + cos phi ) ]

So,

|v2|= sin phi / sqrt( 2(1 + cos phi ) )

Simplify sqrt(2(1 + cos phi )):

2(1 + cos phi ) = 4 cos^2 (phi/2 ), since 1 + cos phi = 2 cos²(phi/2 )

So,

sqrt(2(1 + cos phi )) = sqrt(4 cos^2(phi/2 )) ) = 2 |cos(phi/2 )|

Assuming cos(phi/2 ) is positive, which it is for phi in [0, pi], which is the case for a direction in the x-z plane.

So,

|v2|= sin phi / ( 2 cos(phi/2 ) )

But sin phi = 2 sin(phi/2 ) cos(phi/2 )

So,

|v2|= [ 2 sin(phi/2 ) cos(phi/2 ) ] / ( 2 cos(phi/2 ) ) )= sin(phi/2 )

Thus, |v2|= sin(phi/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ (1 + cos phi )/( sin phi ) * sin(phi/2 ), sin(phi/2 ) ]

Let me compute each component.

Compute (1 + cos phi )/( sin phi ) * sin(phi/2 )

Note that 1 + cos phi = 2 cos²(phi/2 )

And sin phi = 2 sin(phi/2 ) cos(phi/2 )

So,

(1 + cos phi )/( sin phi ) * sin(phi/2 ) = [ 2 cos²(phi/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(phi/2 ) cos(phi/2 ) ] * sin(phi/2 )

Simplify:

= [ cos²(phi/2 ) / ( sin(phi/2 ) cos(phi/2 ) ) ) ] * sin(phi/2 )

= cos(phi/2 ) * sin(phi/2 ) / sin(phi/2 ) cos(phi/2 ) ) * sin(phi/2 )

Wait, perhaps better to compute step by step.

(1 + cos phi ) = 2 cos²(phi/2 )

sin phi = 2 sin(phi/2 ) cos(phi/2 )

So,

(1 + cos phi )/( sin phi ) = [ 2 cos²(phi/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(phi/2 ) cos(phi/2 ) ) ] = [ cos(phi/2 ) ] / [ sin(phi/2 ) ]

So,

(1 + cos phi )/( sin phi ) * sin(phi/2 ) = [ cos(phi/2 ) / sin(phi/2 ) ] * sin(phi/2 ) = cos(phi/2 )

Similarly, v2 is sin(phi/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ cos(phi/2 ), sin(phi/2 ) ]

Which matches the standard spin-up state.

So, when phi=0, the state is [1, 0], which is correct.

When phi= pi/2, the state is [ cos(pi/4 ), sin(pi/4 ) ] = [ 1/√2, 1/√2 ], which is the eigenstate of sigma_x, as expected.

So this now makes sense.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(phi/2 ), sin(phi/2 ) ]

But wait, what is phi in terms of the earlier theta?

In the problem statement, the direction is in the x-z plane, so we can parametrize it using an angle theta from the z-axis, but earlier I used phi as the angle from the z-axis, which is confusing because usually theta is the polar angle.

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the direction is given by an angle theta from the z-axis, and lies in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So when the problem says the direction is in x-z plane, that implies phi=0 in spherical coordinates.

Wait, wait no, in spherical coordinates, phi is the azimuthal angle (angle around the z-axis), so if the direction is in the x-z plane, then phi=0 or pi.

But earlier, I considered parametrizing n as ( sin phi, 0, cos phi ), which would imply that phi is the angle from the z-axis. That may have been the confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the direction is given by an angle theta from the z-axis, so n_x= sin theta, n_z= cos theta, and phi=0.

So in that case, the parametrization is n=( sin theta, 0, cos theta ), with theta ranging from 0 to pi/2 (if in x-z plane), but actually, theta can be from 0 to pi, with phi=0.

Wait, in any case, the eigenvector comes out to be [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Which matches option C.

So the correct eigenvector elements are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 ), so option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the $x$-$z$ plane, we can write $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the $z$-axis. Substituting this into the operator, we get:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we obtain the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
\cos\theta \, v_1 + \sin\theta \, v_2 = v_1, \\
\sin\theta \, v_1 - \cos\theta \, v_2 = v_2.
\end{cases}
\]

From the first equation, we solve for $v_1$ in terms of $v_2$:

\[
v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2.
\]

From the second equation, we solve for $v_1$ again:

\[
v_1 = \frac{1 + \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_2.
\]

Both expressions for $v_1$ are consistent, confirming the eigenvector structure. The eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = v_2 \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 + \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, we compute the normalization factor. The normalization condition is:

\[
|v_1|^2 + |v_2|^2 = 1.
\]

Substituting $v_1 = \frac{1 + \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_2$, we find:

\[
|v_2|^2 \left( \frac{(1 + \cos\theta)^2}{\sin^2\theta} + 1 \right) = 1.
\]

Simplifying the terms:

\[
\frac{(1 + \cos\theta)^2}{\sin^2\theta} + 1 = \frac{(1 + \cos\theta)^2 + \sin^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta} = \frac{2(1 + \cos\theta)}{\sin^2\theta}.
\]

Thus:

\[
|v_2|^2 = \frac{\sin^2\theta}{2(1 + \cos\theta)}.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\sin^2\theta = 4\sin^2(\theta/2)\cos^2(\theta/2)$ and $1 + \cos\theta = 2\cos^2(\theta/2)$, we find:

\[
|v_2| = \sin(\theta/2).
\]

The normalized eigenvector is then:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the standard spin-up state along the direction $\vec{n}$ in the $x$-$z$ plane. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it does not match the standard spin-up form.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it introduces an unnecessary phase factor $e^{i\phi}$, which is zero in this case.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the normalized eigenvector derived above.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces an unnecessary $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$ scaling.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
