Okay, so I have this IUPAC naming question in front of me, and honestly, it's a bit intimidating. But I'll try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my nomenclature, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question describes a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group), a cyano group, a hydroxyl, a dimethylamino group, and a methoxy group. Wait, let me make sure I get all the substituents right.

The setup says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to each other. So, that's three substituents spaced every other position. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. Oh, wait, that's two substituents adjacent to the carboxylic acid. Plus, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm, that's a lot to visualize.

I think the best approach is to draw the benzene ring and assign positions to each substituent based on the description. Let me imagine the benzene ring. I'll number it from 1 to 6 in a clockwise direction.

First, I'll place the carboxylic acid. Let's say it's at position 1 because that's a common starting point. Then, since the carbaldehyde and cyano are meta to the carboxylic acid, they should be at positions 3 and 5, or 4 and 6? Wait, no. Wait, meta means three positions apart. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the meta positions would be 3 and 5. Wait, no, because in a benzene ring, each position is connected to two adjacent positions. So, the positions meta to 1 would be 3 and 5? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: positions 1, 3, 5 are all meta to each other. Oh wait, no. Let me correct myself. The positions adjacent (ortho) to 1 are 2 and 6. The positions meta to 1 are 3 and 5. The para position is 4.

So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde and cyano must be at positions 3 and 5. But wait, the question says they're all meta to each other, so all three substituents (carboxylic, carbaldehyde, cy
