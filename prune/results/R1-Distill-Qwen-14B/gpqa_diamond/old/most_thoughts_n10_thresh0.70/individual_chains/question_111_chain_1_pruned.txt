Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here with two reactions, and I need to figure out the major products A and B. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I think this must be a conjugate addition or some kind of enolate formation leading to a Claisen or aldol reaction. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe it's a Michael addition or a conjugate addition.

The starting compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl. Wait, wait. Wait, cyclohexane has six positions. So numbering starts at the ketone as position 1. Then, position 2 is adjacent, so that's where the ethyl is. Position 6 is across from position 1, so that's a methyl. Hmm, wait, no, let me draw it. So position 1 is ketone. Position 2 is ethyl. Position 6 is a methyl. So the substituents are at 2 (ethyl), 6 (methyl), and maybe 3? Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Oh, wait, the 2 has both ethyl and methyl? No, no. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. So position 2 is substituted with ethyl and methyl. Position 6 has a methyl. So the substituents are: position 1 (ketone), position 2 (ethyl and methyl), position 6 (methyl). So the ring has a lot of substituents. So when this reacts with ethyl acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

In the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, the cyclohexanone would form an enolate. The enolate would attack the alpha position of the ethyl acrylate. But where does the enolate form? The most substituted position. The cyclohexanone has substituents at 2 and 6. So, the ketone is at 1. The possible enolate positions would be at 2 and 3, I think.

Wait, the base would deprotonate the alpha carbons. The cyclohexanone has alpha carbons at C2 and C3. But given the substituents, which position is
