Okay, so I've got this question here about quasars and their observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And then, the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines like the Lyman-alpha line are prominent. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is usually around 121.6 nm in the ultraviolet range. But wait, if we're seeing it at 790 nm, that's longer. So maybe it's redshifted because the quasar is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe.

Right, the redshift (z) would explain why the wavelength is longer. The formula for redshift is observed wavelength (λ_obs) divided by emitted wavelength (λ_emit). So λ_obs is 790 nm, and λ_emit for Lyman-alpha is approximately 121.6 nm. Let me calculate z.

So z = λ_obs / λ_emit - 1. Plugging in the numbers: 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So 6.5 minus 1 is 5.5. Wait, actually, wait: 790 divided by 121.6 is about 6.507. So
