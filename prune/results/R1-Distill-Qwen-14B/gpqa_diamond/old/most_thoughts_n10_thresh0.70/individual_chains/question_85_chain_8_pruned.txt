Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question provides a bunch of data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have their own masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

They also mention that both planets cause shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, but with different amounts—0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The question asks about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, with both having the same albedo.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, and the star's luminosity depends on its radius and effective temperature. 

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) 

But wait, the albedo is the same for both planets, so that part will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the star's temperature, the star's radius, and their orbital distances.

But wait, how do I find the orbital distances from the given data? The problem mentions the Doppler shifts—so the RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the RV
