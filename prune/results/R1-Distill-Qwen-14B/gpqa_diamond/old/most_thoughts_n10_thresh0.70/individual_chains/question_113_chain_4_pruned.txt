Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The question provides information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My task is to figure out the correct chemical formula from the given options.

First, I'll try to break down each piece of data and see what they might indicate about the structure.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. A very broad peak around 3000 cm-1 usually suggests O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. But wait, another strong peak at 1700 cm-1. That's a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The other peak is at 1650 cm-1. Hmm, that might be conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with something else. Wait, 1650 could also be an ester or a conjugated ketone, but I'm not entirely sure.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to CH2=CH- groups, so that suggests there's an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. But wait, vinyl protons in an aromatic ring (like benzene) would be ortho and para to substituents. Alternatively, if it's an alkene, the protons would be on a double bond.

Looking at the mass spec: a fragment peak at m/z=45. I remember that 45 is a common fragment for something like (CH3)2O, which is 45, so maybe an ether group? Or perhaps another structure. Also, when you have fragmentation, it can break into common ions. Wait, another possibility is that 45 could correspond to a methyl group attached to something else, maybe like CH3-O- something, but I'm not certain.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

So, possible functional groups are being suggested by the IR. The 1700 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the very broad peak at 3000 is probably O-H. So maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group? Or perhaps a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, but the FTIR has both 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is strong, so maybe a carbonyl like an ester or ketone. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but that's a lower wavenumber. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, maybe as in an aromatic ketone or something else. Wait, another thought: maybe the 1700 is an ester (C=O), and the 1650 is from an aromatic ring (
