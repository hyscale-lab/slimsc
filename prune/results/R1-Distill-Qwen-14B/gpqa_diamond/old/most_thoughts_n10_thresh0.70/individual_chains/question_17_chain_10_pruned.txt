Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They give the formation constant, K_ca-edta, as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ in a complex. The complex formation is usually described by a formation constant, which is given here as K. 

Wait, the formula for the formation constant, Kf, is something like [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Oh wait, but wait, the problem states that the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So I think all the calcium is bound up in the complex. 

But wait, the problem says the concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. Since the complex is Ca-EDTA and the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of Ca²+ in solution should be related to the Kf value.

Wait, but Kf is given as a very large number, 5
