Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Let me start by looking at each reaction one by one.

First, Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, what's dimethyl malonate? Oh right, it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, so it's like CH2(COOEt)2. And methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, but here it's 3-(p-tolyl), so maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be different. Oh, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? Or maybe the substituent is on the alpha position?

Wait, the molecule is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate group is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think of the structure. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; the substituent is on the alpha carbon, which is the CH2. So if the substituent is on the 3rd position,
