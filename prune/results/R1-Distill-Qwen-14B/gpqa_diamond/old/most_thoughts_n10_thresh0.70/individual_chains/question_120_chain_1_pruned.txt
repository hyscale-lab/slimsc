Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution—oh right, that means the same number per unit volume, I think. So the number density is constant.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth during the year, right? The formula for distance is related to parallax: distance d is about 1/(plx), where plx is in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx.

Wait, but how does parallax relate to the number of stars we observe? Let's think. If stars are uniformly distributed, more stars would be in a larger volume. But how does that translate into the count per unit parallax?

Let me try to model this. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would be proportional to the surface area of the shell. Because the number density is uniform, n, the number is n * 4πd² dd. So the number per unit distance (dd) is n * 4π d².

But wait, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, not per unit distance. So I need to express everything in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So I should express d in terms of plx.

Let me substitute d = 1/plx. Then d
