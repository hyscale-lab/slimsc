Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum system, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. Let's see.

The state of the system is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think that's a vector, but I'm not sure about its normalization. Oh right, quantum states have to be normalized, so maybe I should normalize it first. Let me calculate the norm. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector should be divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. So the correct state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.

Operator P is a 3x3 matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q is:
First row: 1,0,0
Second row: 0,0,0
Third row: 0,0,-1

Hmm. So Q is a diagonal matrix, which probably means its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, right? Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues for the corresponding eigenvectors, I think.

The question is about measuring P and then Q. Wait, the measurements are done one after the other. So first, measure P, then, given that outcome, measure Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the way the problem is phrased: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So the first measurement is P, and the second is Q, so the probability is the probability that P is 0, and then given that, Q is -1. So it's the product of the probabilities if the state after P is measured is the eigenstate of P, which might affect the state for Q.

Wait, no, when you measure P and get a certain outcome, the system collapses into the corresponding eigenstate. Then, when you measure Q on that eigenstate, it might or might not have Q as -1. So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that the state is the P=0 eigenstate.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the joint probability is the amplitude squared for the combined event, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, since Q is diagonal, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize and find the probabilities.

Wait, let's think again. The state is |Ïˆ> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

First, we measure P. The operator P has eigenvalues which we can find by diagonalizing it. Wait, what are the eigenvalues of P?

Alternatively, perhaps P
