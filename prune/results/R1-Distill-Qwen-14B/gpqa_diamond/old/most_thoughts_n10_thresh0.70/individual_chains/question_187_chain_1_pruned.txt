Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, let's think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), specifically the 8m telescopes at Paranal. The key point here is that it's about detectability based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a one-hour exposure. The threshold is S/N of at least 10.

Wait, what determines the S/N ratio for a spectrograph? I think it's mainly the brightness of the star and the instrument's characteristics. Brighter stars will have higher S/N because more photons are detected. Also, the exposure time is fixed at one hour, so the star's brightness is the main factor here.

Absolute magnitude is a measure of a star's intrinsic brightness. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. But wait, absolute magnitude can be a bit tricky because it's a logarithmic scale. Oh right, each step of 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in brightness. So, a star with an absolute magnitude (M) of 15 is really faint. Wait, what's the Sun's absolute magnitude? I think it's about 4.8. So M=15 is way dimmer.

But the stars in the options all have the same absolute magnitude of 15, except for one that's maybe different. Wait, no, looking again: options a and b have different names, others have M=15. Oh, right, a is Canopus, which is a bright star. Canopus is one of the brightest stars in the sky. I think its apparent magnitude is around -0.7, making it very bright. Polaris is another star, which is the North Star. I believe Polaris is about magnitude 2, so it's bright, but
