Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So the astronaut's own time (proper time) would be less than the time observed from Earth.

The problem states that the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Wow, that's really close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and they want to know how long the trip will take from their perspective.

Wait, but the question says the average lifetime is roughly 150 solar years. So the astronaut is 22 now; if the trip takes, say, 70 years from their perspective, they'd be 92 when they arrive. That's well under 150, so they should live. So option A, where they die before reaching, might not be the right answer.

But let's think through the calculations. I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. Proper time is the shortest time between two events in a particular frame—in this case, the astronaut's frame.

The formula for time dilation is the proper time (tau) equals the time measured in Earth's frame (t) multiplied by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, do I know t? No, I don't. I know the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Wait, what's the distance there?

The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think the distance is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me check, I remember it being roughly 160,000 ly. So the distance D is about 160,000 light-years.

The speed v is 0.99999987c. So the time t from Earth's frame is D divided by v. Let's compute that.

t = D / v → (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, and speed is in terms of c, the unit conversion should work out.

So t ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 years? Wait, wait—no, because v is almost c. Let's compute it accurately.

Wait a second, 0.99999987 is very close to 1. So D is 160,000 light-years. So t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 1 ≈ 160,000 years. But wait, that's a huge number. If the astronaut is 22, and the trip takes 160,000 years, they'd be way older than 150, so they wouldn't survive. But that conflicts with my initial thought. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.

Wait no, because from the astronaut's perspective, the time is much shorter due to time dilation. Oh wait, no, wait. The proper time is the astronaut's time. So the Earth time is longer.

So the time on Earth would be about 160,000 years. But the astronaut's experienced time would be tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that factor.

v = 0.99999987c, so v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ approximately (1 - 1.3e-6), but let me compute it more accurately.

0.99999987 squared: Let's compute (1 - 1.3e-6)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-6 + (1.3e-6)^2, which is negligible. So approximately 1 - 2.6e-6 → 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6e-6. So sqrt(2.6e-6) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so 1.612e-3 ≈ 0.001612.

So the gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 1/0.001612 ≈ 620. So the gamma is about 620.

Wait, but that would mean that the Earth time is 620 times the proper time. So tau = t / gamma. Because t = gamma * tau.

Wait, no, earlier I had tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which is t / gamma, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So t is 160,000 years (approximate). So tau = 160,000 / 620 ≈ let's compute
