Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is often involved in Diels-Alder reactions because it's a good dienophile. So I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction scenario.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. The diene should be conjugated and in an s-cis conformation. The dienophile here is maleic anhydride. So the other reactant, 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene, must act as the diene.

Wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, no. Wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, right? So the ring is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, making it conjugated. That makes it a good diene for the Diels-Alder reaction. So the diene is the cyclopenta-1,3-diene, and the dienophile is maleic anhydride.

But wait, the molecule is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. So the fluorine is at position
