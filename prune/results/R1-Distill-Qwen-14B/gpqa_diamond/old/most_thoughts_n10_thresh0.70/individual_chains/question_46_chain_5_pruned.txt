Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is a process where the positions of substituents in a carbon-carbon double bond are exchanged. So, Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, right? It's used for ring-closing metathesis and other olefin metathesis reactions.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But in this case, since the molecule is symmetric, maybe the racemic part doesn't matter for the product. Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene: the pentene chain has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait: wait, the formula of pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be on the third carbon, which is the middle one in pentene. So the structure would be: CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it out. Carbon 1: CH₂=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: C(CH3), so the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)–CH2–CH3? No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So if it's 3-methyl, the double bond is between
