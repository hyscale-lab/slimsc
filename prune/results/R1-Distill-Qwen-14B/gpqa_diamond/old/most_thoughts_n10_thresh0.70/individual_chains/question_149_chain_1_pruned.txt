Okay, so I've got this question about a peptidic compound's analysis. Let me try to think through it. Hmm, the scenario is that the 1H NMR and LC-MS results are a bit off. Let me break down the details.

First, the 1H NMR of the crude compound mostly matches expectations except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, they're probably not split from each other because the coupling was ruled out. Wait, the coupling pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're each other's neighbors causing splitting.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So, same molecular mass but different retention times. Because MS shows same mass, they're not different in mass, so not different isotopes. But why two peaks then?

The options given are A to D. Let's consider each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. A precursor would have a lower mass, right? Because a precursor in a synthesis step is like the starting material before the next step. So if the LC-MS shows same mass, the same as the product, then it's not a precursor. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular mass and same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. In LC-MS, would they elute at different times? Well, if the LC is a chiral column, then enantiomers would separate. But if it's a normal column, they might not. Hmm, the question says LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature. Wait, sometimes temperature can influence separation in HPLC. If the two compounds are enantiomers, they might not be separated on a regular column, but maybe if the temperature is high enough, could they separate? Or perhaps the LC used here is a chiral column. But the key is the NMR. Enantiomers would have the same NMR spectrum because the environments are mirror images. Wait, in the NMR, the two peaks for the same alpha proton: but if they're enantiomers, each would have the same environment, so the same shift. So why are there two peaks? Because each enantiomer would contribute the same shift. Oh wait, no. If the sample is a racemic mixture (equal enantiomers), then the NMR would show a single peak because they're identical in that spectrum. So B seems unlikely because the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, but enantiomers wouldn't do that.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that means. But wait, double coupling could cause splitting in NMR. But the question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not that. Alternatively, perhaps it refers to some kind of coupling leading to two peaks. But I'm not too clear on this option.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diast
