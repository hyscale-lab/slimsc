Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions involving two mixtures, X and Y, and a substance Z. Let's break it down.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually means the mixture has something that can reduce bromine, like alkenes or something with unsaturated bonds. But since it's a mixture of two liquids, maybe each has such a property, or together they react.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction that forms mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So the product Y doesn't have any unsaturated bonds? Or maybe it's more saturated now.

Next, both X and Y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, give only one substance Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Hmm, that number seems familiar. Calculating that, 14.28% is roughly 1/7, so maybe the hydrogen is 1/7 of the molar mass. Let me think: if the mass is 14.28%, then for a molecule like CnHmO?, the molar mass would be 100/14.28 ≈ 7 times the mass of hydrogen. Wait, maybe it's simpler. For example, if Z is ethane, which is C2H6. Let's see: the mass of H is (6 * 1)/(2*12 +6) = 6/(30) = 0.2, which is 20%, not 14.28%. So maybe a different compound. What about cyclopropane? No, that's C3H6, same as propene. Wait, maybe it's another structure. Let me think: 14.28% is 1/7, so maybe Z is something like C6H5CH3? No, that has more carbons. Wait, another approach: 14.28% is 1/7, so (mass of H)/(molar mass) = 1/7. Let me denote molar mass as M, and hydrogen as H. So H = M/7. 

Assuming Z is a hydrocarbon (only C and H), so M = 12n + m, where n is the number of carbons and m the number of hydrogens. The hydrogen mass is m*1, so (m)/M = 1/7 → m = M/7. Substituting M = 12n + m → m = (12n + m)/7 → 7m = 12n +m → 6m =12n →
