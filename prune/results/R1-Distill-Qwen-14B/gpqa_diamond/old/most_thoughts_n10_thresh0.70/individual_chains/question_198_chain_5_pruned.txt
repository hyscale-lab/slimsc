Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and complex ions yet. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Hmm, stability constants, right. I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So each β corresponds to a different complex, probably with different numbers of SCN- ligands attached to Co(II).

Wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2−n? Or maybe CoSCN stuff. Let me think. Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for Co(SCN)_n^(2−n), the charge would be +2 + n*(-1) = 2 - n. So for example, Co(SCN) would be Co+2 + SCN- → CoSCN which is neutral? Wait, no, Co^2+ plus one SCN^- would give CoSCN^+ because 2+ -1 = +1. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2−n. So for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+ because 2+ -1 = +1, but that can't be because the charge would be +1. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is the stability constants. Each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ions.

Stability constants are usually given for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligand. For example, the formation of [Co(SCN)]^+ would have a β1 of 9. Then the next complex, [Co(SCN)_2], would have a β2 of 40. Wait, but β2 is the formation constant for the second complex. Or maybe each β represents the step
