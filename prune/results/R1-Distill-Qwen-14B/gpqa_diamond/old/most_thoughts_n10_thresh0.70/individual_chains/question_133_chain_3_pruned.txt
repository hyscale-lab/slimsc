Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, and we're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm. So I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The different KAs suggest that each deprotonation step has a different tendency. Since we're dealing with KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, perhaps these are the di- and tri-phosphate species?

Wait, no. Let me think: H3PO4 can lose protons to form H2PO4^- (after losing one), HPO4^2- (after two), and PO4^3- (after three). So the species in solution would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4 is 2Na+ and HPO4^2-.

But wait, when these two are dissolved in water, they can undergo hydrolysis. So I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-? Or maybe the free HPO4^2- concentration? Or perhaps the PO4^3-? Hmm, the term orthophosphate usually refers to PO4^3-.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-. So the problem is asking for [PO4^3-] in the solution.

But how do I get from the given salts to PO4^3-? Because the salts provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Ah, right. The solution is a buffer because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So the pH of the solution will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Once I find the pH, I can then find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation constant, Ka3.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt added.
2. Find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer.
4. Use the pH to find [H+], then use Ka3 to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, but what's the exact process here?

First, let's compute the moles. The solution volume is 200 mL or 0.2 L.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So:

moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 g. Molar mass is
