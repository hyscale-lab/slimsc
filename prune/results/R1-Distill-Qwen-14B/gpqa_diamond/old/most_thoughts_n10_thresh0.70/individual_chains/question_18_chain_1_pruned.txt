Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, when it comes to elemental abundances, mass might not be the main factor here. The problem gives some [X/Y] ratios for each star.

Let me list what's given:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 = 1e-5

Wait, let me make sure. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of (X/Y ratio divided by their solar ratio). Or wait, no, the [X/Y] notation is usually log10(X/Y) relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun )

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means Fe/H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] = 0 implies (Fe/H)_star = (Fe/H)_sun.

Same for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg/H in Star_2 is same as solar.

Wait, but what about the other ratios? For Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. Which means (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0
