Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That's also called being chiral. Chiral molecules have a plane of symmetry? No, wait, no plane of symmetry. Because if they did, they wouldn't be chiral. So, chirality happens when the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists four different organic moieties and asks which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4, and the possible answers are combinations of these.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. So, the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6 and 6' (wait, wait, the numbering—biphenyl has two rings, each with their own numbering. So positions 6 and 6' are on each ring?), and at positions 2 and 2' are the carboxylic acid ester groups (since it's dicarboxylate and dimethyl, so OMe groups attached as esters). 

Now, biphenyl systems can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So the question is, does this structure have any such features?

Wait, the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6. Let me visualize the structure. The biphenyl is [1,1'], meaning the two phenyl rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Are these positions para to each other? Because on a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1, which is where the connection is. So each ring has two substituents: a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. 

Wait, but for each ring, substituents at 2 and 6—so the two groups on each ring are adjacent to the point of connection. That might make each ring have two substituents in adjacent positions. So, does the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the two rings are identical in their substituents, perhaps the whole molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, the substituents on each ring are the same: 2 is a carboxylate, 6 is nitro. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So looking at the molecule, the substituents on each ring are same. So the molecule would be symmetrical across the central bond. So perhaps the molecule is not chiral.

But wait, what about the substituents on each ring? Let me think: each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate. So each ring has two substituents. If the molecule is symmetrical, then maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents could lead to a chiral center.

Wait, but in the biphenyl structure, the central bond is single, so the two rings can rotate relative to each other. But for a molecule to have stereoisomerism, there must be a fixed arrangement. So unless the rings are locked in a certain conformation, perhaps the molecule is not chiral. Wait, but in some cases, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, even with a single bond, maybe it can show optical isomerism. Wait, like in biphenyls with certain substituents, you can have atropisomerism. But that's when the molecule is rigid and the rings can't rotate past certain positions. So atropisomers are a type of stereoisomerism.

In this case, are the substituents such that the rings can't rotate freely? For example, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule rigid, like if the substituents are on adjacent positions and hinder rotation. So, if the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, which are adjacent to the connecting carbon (position 1), then the two substituents on each ring are adjacent. So perhaps the molecule is rigid enough that the rings can't rotate freely, leading to distinct conformations that are non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, but wait. For atropisomerism, the molecule must have a sufficiently high barrier to rotation to allow for distinct stereoisomers. So, if the substituents are large, like nitro groups, they can create a steric hindrance, preventing rotation. In this case, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. Those are both bulky groups, perhaps. So maybe the molecule can't rotate, leading to atropisomerism. So this compound might exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe not. I'm a bit confused. I think that if the molecule is symmetrical, it won't be chiral. Wait, but if the substituents make the two rings non-symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral. Hmm, maybe. I'll have to think more on this.

Moving on to number 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure of this is: the ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as lactic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3COHCOOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be the methyl ester: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Looking for chiral centers. The molecule would have a carbon chain: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is CH(OH). Let's see: the central carbon is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from CH2(OH)CH2... wait, no. Wait, wait: the structure is actually CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, but wait, wait. Let me get this right. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. But 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be:

Carbon chain: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So numbering from the COOH end, the first carbon is COOH, second is CH2, third is CH3. But if it's 2-hydroxy, then the hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is the CH2 group. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon is CH2, but wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propane chain. So the propane chain is: [COOCH3]-CH(OH)-CH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (which is the other substituent),
- and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, wait: the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH with OH. Let's count the substituents:

- One CH3 group (left side),
- One OH,
- One COOCH3 group (right side),
- And one hydrogen attached to the central carbon.

Wait no, wait. The structure would be:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO- but wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Oh wait, but in this structure, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is CH2. Oh wait, no. Let me write it step by step.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH(OH)CH2COO-? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the formula is CH₂CH₂COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon from the COOH.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, it's:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one attached to the OH. Let me draw it:

The central carbon (second carbon) is CH2, but it's attached to OH. Wait, no. What's the structure again? Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that structure, the central carbon (the one with OH) is CH2. So the substituents are:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right),
- One OH,
- One COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, but that carbon is attached to:

- One CH2(OH),
- One CH2COOCH3,
- And two hydrogens?

Wait, no. Let me think of the actual structure. The molecule is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2OH.

Wait, so the structure is:

The central carbon is the one attached to the CH2OH and CH2COOCH3 groups. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. That would be:

- COOCH3 is on one end,
- Then a CH2,
- Then a CH2OH.

So the molecule is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but that would be a straight chain. So the central carbon (the one between the two CH2 groups) would be a CH2 group. So each of those carbons would have four substituents: each is attached to two CH2 groups, an OH (in the case of the last carbon), and a COOCH3 (in the first carbon). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as follows: the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me consider propanoic acid as CH2CH2COOH. So the chain is COOH-CH2-CH2-OH. So the hydroxyl is on the second carbon from the COOH.

In that case, the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but that can't be correct because that would make the hydroxyl on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is:

The central carbon is attached to:

- CH2(OH),
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two hydrogens.

Wait, but that would make the central carbon a CH2, meaning it's not a chiral center. Because for a chiral center, you need four different substituents.

So, if the central carbon is CH2-OH, then the substituents are:

- One CH2COOCH3 group,
- One OH,
- Two CH2 groups (maybe). No, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH(OH)CH2COO-.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So if the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, that's a straight chain. The central carbon (the one in the middle) is connected to two CH2 groups. So the substituents on that carbon are two CH2 groups, but wait, no, each CH2 would be connected to another group.

Wait, no. The structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

In this structure, the middle carbon (the one between COOCH3 and CH2OH) is a CH2. So it's attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2OH group,
- And two CH2 groups? No, wait. Each carbon in a chain has two CH2 groups attached. Wait, perhaps the molecule is more accurately drawn as:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are arranged as:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

So the middle carbon is the second carbon in the chain. It is attached to:

- One COOCH3 (from the first carbon),
- One CH2OH (from the third carbon),
- And two CH2 groups (wait, no, each CH2 is attached to the next carbon.)

Wait, perhaps the middle carbon in this structure is attached to:

- The COOCH3 group (from the left),
- The CH2OH group (from the right),
- And two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make it a CH2 group, not a chiral center. Because a chiral center needs four different substituents.

So perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, the formula of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3COOCH2CH2OH. No, that would be something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is making it hard to see if there's a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps another approach. 2-hydroxypropanoate—this is the same as the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as lactic acid. The structure of lactic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, does that mean the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH? So the ester would replace the -OH of the COOH with OCH3.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In that structure, the central carbon (the CH with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH3?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (the CH with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (right),
- and a hydrogen? Because CH(OH) would have a CH group attached to OH and another CH3.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH2 group? No, no, wait.

Wait, no. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that can't be because that would make it CH(OH) with two substituents: CH3 and COOCH3, and OH and H. So that's four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. Therefore, Carbon 2 is a chiral center because it's connected to four different groups. So the molecule would have a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

So number 2 is a yes for optical isomerism.

Next, number 3: benzophenone.

Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone. The structure is Ph-CO-Ph. So, a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center because it's only attached to three groups (since double bonds don't count for substituents in terms of chirality). The two phenyl groups are attached to the carbonyl.

So, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Are there any chiral centers? No, because the carbonyl carbon has three substituents: two phenyls and an oxygen. Wait, no. Let me think again: the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's only bonded to two phenyl groups and has a double bond. So it's not a chiral center because it's trigonal, not tetrahedral. So no chiral centers here.

What about any other parts of the molecule? The phenyl rings themselves are flat and symmetrical. So in benzophenone, there are no chiral centers, and the molecule is planar. So it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. So number 3 is a no.

Number 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with the structure HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The cis and trans isomer would be maleic and fumaric, respectively.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me.

The structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–(COOCH3), but with a double bond. Wait, no, fumarate is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C–CH=CH–CO2H, with the double bond between the second and third carbons. So the substituents (the two COOH groups) are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans). Fumarate is the trans isomer.

So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure MeO2C–CH=CH–CO2Me, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, can this molecule exhibit optical isomerism? Because it has a double bond, but for a molecule to be chiral, it must have a chiral center or some other element of chirality, like a plane of asymmetry or a center of inversion.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, does it have any chiral centers? Let's look.

The carbons in the double bond are each attached to two groups. The central two carbons are:

CH2(COOCH3) and CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond in between. Wait, no, fumarate is HO2C–CH₂–CH₂–CO2H, but that's not right. No, wait, HO2C–CH=CH–CO2H is correct. So when esterified, it becomes MeO2C–CH=CH–CO2Me.

So each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has two substituents. For example, the left CH in the double bond is attached to:

- The COOCH3 group,
- The double bond,
- And two CH groups? No, wait. Wait, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3? No, no, fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, the structure is:

The two carbonyl groups (COOCH3) are on the same carbon as the double bond.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the structure of fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂H. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂Me.

So each of the two central carbons in the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One hydrogen (since it's CH=CH).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the actual structure right. The structure is:

HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H is succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂H. So, the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond between them.

So, when you esterify both COOH groups with methanol, you get MeO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂Me.

So, each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH group (the other end of the double bond),
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 if it's a single bond, but in fumarate, it's a double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 would be succinate ester, but fumarate is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, no, actually, the structure is:

The two COOCH3 groups are on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So, the central part is CH₂–CH₂? No, it's CH–CH. Wait, no, it's CH₂–CH₂ would be single bonds, but in fumarate, it's CH=CH.

So each of the two central carbons is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One double bond (so bonded to two other carbons),
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, but each CH in the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3,
- One H,
- And two CHs (from the double bond).

Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two other carbons via the double bond, and each has two substituents. So each of those carbons has:

- One COOCH3,
- One H,
- And two bonds in the double bond (so they're each double-bonded to the other).

So, each of the double-bonded carbons has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each has two substituents, but for a chiral center, you need four different substituents.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two central carbons are each connected to two groups: COOCH3 and H, and two bonds in the double bond. So no, they don't have four substituents. Therefore, there are no chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, but wait. Could there be any other sources of chirality? Such as a plane of asymmetry or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's think. In the structure of dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends of the double bond. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two COOCH3 groups. So it's symmetrical. So the molecule is not chiral, and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Fumaric acid is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. The dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. But does that make the molecule chiral? Because when you have a trans double bond, can that lead to chirality?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a trans configuration. Now, in some cases, when you have a double bond with substituents on either side, if the substituents are different, the molecule can be chiral. For example, in the case of a disubstituted double bond where each substituent is different and arranged in a way that creates non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, both substituents on each double bond carbon are the same: each has COOCH3 and H. So, each CH in the double bond has the same substituents on both sides. So, the two double-bonded carbons are identical in substituents. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is fumarate known as a diastereomer of maleic acid? Because they have different configurations. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer. So in maleate, the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond, making the molecule chiral? Or not?

Wait, no. Let me think about maleic acid: it's cis, so the two COOH groups are on the same side. So the structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH groups. So the structure is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH with both COOH groups on the same side.

So dimethyl maleate would have the ester groups on the same side of the double bond. But in that case, does that make the molecule chiral?

No, because the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, perhaps in the case of a disubstituted double bond, if the substituents are the same on both carbons, the molecule can be achiral. So, whether the substituents are cis or trans, if they're the same on each side, the molecule could be achiral.

But wait, in the case where the substituents are different, then the molecule could be chiral. For example, (E) and (Z) isomerism for alkenes with different substituents on each carbon.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two CHs in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a H. So, each CH is attached to the same groups on both sides. So the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, it's not chiral.

So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a moment. I'm getting confused because I thought that fumarate and maleate could be sources of chiral esters. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral; otherwise, it's chiral.

Looking at dimethyl fumarate:

The structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

But with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, in this structure, the molecule is symmetrical along the plane that bisects the double bond. So, it's a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, if the substituents on each end of the double bond were different, would that change things? For instance, if one side had a COOCH3 and the other a different group, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, both substituents are the same.

So, number 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, perhaps it's not chiral because it's symmetrical. So no optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not sure. Earlier thought was that it might exhibit atropisomerism if the substituents are large enough to prevent rotation. But if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it's not chiral.

Wait, the substituents are nitro and carboxylate on each ring. Each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So, the two rings have substituents in the same positions. So, looking at it, would this cause the molecule to be symmetrical?

If the two rings are mirror images of each other, then the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but in the case where the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical, it would not be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, the whole molecule would be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

But without a clear understanding, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think: if the two rings are connected in a way that each has a nitro and a carboxylate, and the positions are such that the substituents are on opposite sides relative to the central bond, could that create a chiral molecule?

Wait, if the two substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. But if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it's not.

Alternatively, if the molecule can't rotate freely because of the substituents, then it might have atropisomerism. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of another way. Let me consider the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's achiral. If not, it's chiral.

In this case, looking at the substituents on each ring: on each ring, position 2 is a carboxylate ester, position 6 is nitro. So, for each ring, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6. When connected as biphenyl, the two rings are mirror images. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's not chiral.

So, number 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, now, going back to the four compounds:

1. No optical isomerism.

2. Yes, because it has a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, but the question says, which of the following show optical isomerism. So, only compound 2 does.

But looking at the options:

Options:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1 and 2.

Wait, according to our analysis, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1 and 2.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 is correct, so none of the options list only 2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center or are capable of atropisomerism.

1. If it's a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, it may have atropisomerism if the substituents prevent rotation. If the substituents are large enough (like nitro groups), then the molecule could have restricted rotation, leading to atropisomers.

So, for number 1, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the rings can't rotate, making the molecule chiral, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, perhaps number 1 is correct.

Number 2 is correct.

Number 4: Fumarate is a trans-diepoxide, but in the ester form, dimethyl fumarate. If the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, the molecule is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, if number 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, then the correct options would include both 1 and 2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 1 and 2.

So, the answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought number 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is an ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So, the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

In such a case, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the structure:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Looking at this, the molecule is symmetrical, as flipping it over the central plane would leave it unchanged. So, it's a meso compound, thus not chiral.

Hmm, so number 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, back to the four moieties:

1: Maybe yes (if atropisomerism is possible),

2: Yes,

3: No,

4: No.

So, the correct options would be 1 and 2.

Looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

So, the answer would be D.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image, often due to a chiral center or restricted rotation leading to atropisomerism.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at positions 6 and carboxylate esters at positions 2 on each ring. The molecule may exhibit atropisomerism if the substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) are large enough to restrict rotation between the rings, creating non-superimposable conformations. Given the steric hindrance from the bulky nitro and carboxylate groups, atropisomerism is likely. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one attached to OH, CH₃, COOCH₃, and H) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center because it is trigonal (double-bonded to oxygen). Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical and planar, lacking any chirality. Thus, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH₃O₂C-CH=CH-CO₂CH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration). The molecule is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. This symmetry makes it achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to atropisomerism (for compound 1) and the presence of a chiral center (for compound 2). Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral due to symmetry or lack of chirality elements.
