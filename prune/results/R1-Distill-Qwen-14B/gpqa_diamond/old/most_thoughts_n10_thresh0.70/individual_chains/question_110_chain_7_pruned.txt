Okay, so I’ve got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the question gives some key points about each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—brighter than 17? Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the more negative the magnitude, the brighter the object. So when they say "brighter than 17 mag," that means the apparent magnitude is less than 17 because lower numbers are brighter.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 is visible to HIRES. But wait, no—no, wait, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, meaning it can see stars that are up to 17 mag, right? Because "brighter" in magnitude terms is lower. So a star at 17 mag is the dimmest ESPRESSO can see. Wait, no, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"—so brighter than 17, meaning V mag less than 17. So any star with V less than 17 is visible by ESPRESSO, and any with V less than 1

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including star characterization. 

The question gives me some details about each star's parameters, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments. Let's break down the problem.

First, I should understand the observing capabilities of each spectrograph. The user note says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, but wait—what's the exact cutoff? Because it says "brighter than 17 mag," which means apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is 17 or less, it's detectable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16.

Wait, no, wait again. The note says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, ESPRESSO's limit is V ≤ 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So anything with V less than 17 is okay. Similarly, HIRES can observe V ≤ 16.

So both spectrographs can observe the same star only if the star's apparent magnitude is ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. But wait, wait—also, ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So if a star is at V=16, both can observe it. If a star is V=17, only ESPRESSO can observe it. But for both, the star must be ≤16.

So the first step is to calculate the apparent V magnitude of each star and see which ones are ≤16 for both.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes and distance given. Others have apparent magnitudes. Oh, for Star3 and Star4, there's extinction (E(B-V)) which affects the apparent magnitude. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude
