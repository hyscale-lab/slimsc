Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy. Hmm, let me think. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So when quasars emit this light, it's at 1216 Angstroms. But if a cloud of hydrogen is in front of the quasar, it can absorb that specific wavelength. But for us to observe that absorption, the wavelength has to be shifted into the visible range because ground-based telescopes can't see ultraviolet light effectively, especially since the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV.

Redshift, z, is the key here. When something is moving away, the wavelength stretches. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z). So I need to find when the Lyman alpha wavelength is redshifted into the optical range.

What's the optical range? I think visible light is roughly 400-700 nm. Let me convert 1216 Angstroms to nanometers because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. That's in the far ultraviolet. To get into the optical, it needs to be longer than 400 nm.

So, lambda_obs = 121.6 nm * (1 + z) â‰¥ 400 nm.

Wait, but wait, the quasar's light is absorbed if the cloud is in front. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms (if the cloud is at a certain redshift). Oh, but wait, if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, the cloud's absorption would be in the quasar's rest frame. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait no, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the quasar is at a higher redshift. So the light from the quasar that passes through the cloud will have its Lyman alpha wavelength absorbed
