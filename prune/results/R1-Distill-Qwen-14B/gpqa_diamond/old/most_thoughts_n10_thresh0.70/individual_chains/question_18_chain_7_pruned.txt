Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's all about. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, do the masses even matter here? The problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is a red herring. Or maybe it's just there for context but not directly needed for the calculations. I'll keep that in mind.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, assuming LTE. I remember that LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means the gas in each region of the star's atmosphere behaves as if it's in equilibrium. The EW method refers to using equivalent widths of spectral lines to determine abundances. But again, maybe the specifics are not needed here.

The given values:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si1 / n_Si2) is what I'm looking for.

Wait, but each star has its own set of abundances. Let me parse each star's data.

Starting with Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. The notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/Y in the Sun). So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] is log10(n_Fe1 / n_H1) - log10(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) = 0. So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given:
For the Sun, 1
