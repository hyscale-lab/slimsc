Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options for A and B are given, and I need to pick the correct pair.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think. So, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? When you have a ketone reacting with a nitrile source like NaCN, what usually happens? Oh wait, I remember that the formation of a cyanohydrin comes to mind. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide ion. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a proton, leading to the formation of the nitrile and an alcohol group.

But wait, what's the reagent for that? I think the reaction typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. Like, H+ is needed because the cyanide is a weak nucleophile. So H3O+ would act as an acid, providing the necessary protons. Alternatively, sometimes NaHSO3 is used, but I'm not sure about that.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives the cyanohydrin. So A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+, which makes sense. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe NaHSO3 could be a source of H+ and SO3^-? Not sure, but I think H3O+ is more straightforward for this reaction.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a structure with a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. I need to convert the nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical way is hydrolysis with strong acid and heat, or maybe using a strong base. Wait, or maybe using something like H2O with a catalyst. Alternatively, using HCl as a reagent?

Wait, let's think. Nitrile to carboxylic acid... I think the reaction is hydrolysis. For example, under acidic conditions, H2O can add to the nitrile. The hydrolysis can be done with H2O and an acid catalyst. Or is it that the nitrile is first converted to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid?

Alternatively, maybe using a strong acid like HCl in water. So reagent B is H2O, and the reaction is in aqueous acidic conditions. So for the second step, reagent B would be HCl. Because the question says B is H2O, but maybe the reagent is HCl as the acid. Wait, the second reaction is with B as H2O, but perhaps B is the acid catalyst. 

Wait, looking again: the second reaction has reagent B as H2O. Oh wait, perhaps the actual reagent is HCl in water. So when the options say B is HCl, then that would make sense. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C as HCl as well.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (option A or B), and for the second, B is HCl (so options A and C have B as HCl).

Wait, but the second reaction: the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you get a carboxylic acid. How does that proceed? Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, the nitrile might first get protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then water attacks, leading to the formation of an amide, which then gets further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.

So for the second reaction, perhaps the reagent is a strong acid, like HCl in water. So reagent B is HCl. So looking at the options, options A and C have B as HCl.

But wait, the question says that in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O. So maybe B is HCl because the reaction is performed in aqueous HCl. So the reagent is HCl, acting as the acid catalyst in the hydrolysis.

Wait, let me double-check the options. The options for B in the second reaction are either HCl or CH3COOH. So option A: B is HCl. Option D: B is CH3COOH.

So if the second step requires acidic hydrolysis, then using HCl (a strong acid) would be more effective. Acetic acid is a weak acid; perhaps it's not strong enough for the hydrolysis under the conditions given.

So putting it together:

First reaction: A is H3O+ (from option A or B), and the second reaction B is HCl (from option A or C).

Looking at the options, option A has A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Option C has A = NaHSO3 and B = HCl. So which one is correct for the first reaction?

Wait, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So the reaction is a ketone reacting with CN- in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the reagent A is the acid. H3O+ is a strong acid, which provides the H+.

Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with such additions, H2SO4 is used, but in the options, it's either H3O+ or NaHSO3. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What does that do? I think bisulfite is used in the hydroxyboration reaction, but not as an acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. Or wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe NaHSO3 can act as a source of H+ because it's a salt of a weak acid (H2SO3, which is H+ and HS O3^-). So NaHSO3 can provide H+ ions as well.

But in the first reaction, the standard reagent is H3O+ (like H2SO4 or HCl as a source of H+). Alternatively, maybe using NaHSO3 as the acid source. But I'm not certain whether H3O+ is more appropriate.

Wait, but the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO? Wait, butanone is butan-2-one, structure: (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, giving (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons, so 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH2(C-OH)(CH3)CN? No, maybe it's (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN? Not sure, but perhaps I should focus more on the reagents.

So for the first reaction, the correct reagent is an acid, probably H3O+. So options A and B have A as H3O+. Now, in the options, option A has B as HCl, which would fit for the second reaction. So that would suggest option A is the correct answer.

But wait, option D has A as NaHSO3 and B as CH3COOH. Not sure about that. So why would NaHSO3 be used in the first reaction? Maybe because it's a milder acid. Alternatively, perhaps NaHSO3 is used in the presence of a ketone for some other reaction, but I'm not recalling.

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction uses a different acid. If the second reaction is in H2O and needs an acid, perhaps it's a weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH), but I thought it needed a strong acid. Wait, but if the nitrile is in an aqueous solution with a weak acid, perhaps it's possible. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another way to make a carboxylic acid from nitrile is by hydrolysis using H2O under acidic conditions, so HCl is more likely.

So considering all that, the correct reagents would be A as H3O+ and B as HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities where NaHSO3 could be the right reagent for the first reaction?

NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- is a weak acid). So it can act as an acid catalyst. So perhaps in the first reaction, using NaHSO3 as the acid would be possible. But I'm not certain which is more common. I think H3O+ is more commonly used in the formation of cyanohydrins.

So with that in mind, the correct option would be A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and a common catalyst for such reactions, making it the most suitable choice for reagent A. While NaHSO₃ can also act as an acid due to its ability to donate H⁺ ions, it is less commonly used in this context compared to H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) using reagent B. This hydrolysis reaction typically requires acidic conditions to proceed efficiently. HCl is a strong acid and is well-suited for this transformation, making it the appropriate choice for reagent B. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), being a weak acid, is less effective for this reaction under the given conditions.

Considering the reagents for both reactions, the correct pair is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
