Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. The state of the system is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operator P is a 3x3 matrix. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. So, to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the overlap with the given state.

But wait, the given state isn't normalized, right? Oh, right. The state vector here is (-1, 2, 1)^T. I should probably normalize it first because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes of the amplitudes. So the first step is to find the norm of this vector.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2. Let's calculate that: 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1)^T.

Next, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because the probability of measuring 0 is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the projections of the state onto each of these eigenvectors.

So let's write down operator P. It's a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, so P looks like this:

[ 0     1/√2   0   ]
[1/√2   0    1/√2 ]
[ 0     1/√2   0   ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Since we're interested in eigenvalue 0, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So, the equation is (P - 0 I)
