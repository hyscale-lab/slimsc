Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just add them like I would in classical mechanics. Oh right, I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed.

Wait, wait. The question is about the relative speed between them. So I guess I need to find how fast one is moving relative to the other. Let me recall the formula. Oh yeah, the formula is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 minus (v1*v2)/(c squared)). Oh wait, but wait—does the order matter? Let me think. Since they're moving in the same direction, I should subtract their speeds in the same order. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) ). Let me compute that.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the relative speed is from one's perspective. So if I'm astronaut A, what's the speed of astronaut B relative to me? So the formula is (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_B v_A)/(c²)) ), but wait no, I think I got that backwards. Oh wait, no, actually, the formula is (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)) ) if you're considering the velocity of B as seen from A's frame. Or is it (v2 - v1)/(1 - ... )? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²))

Where u is the velocity of an object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the frame itself. So in this case, if the original frame is the rest frame of astronaut A (mass 2m moving at 0.6c relative to, say, Earth), and
