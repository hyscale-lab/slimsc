Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ equal to (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in qubit space from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. But how do I relate this to a geometrical position in space?

Oh right! I think the Bloch sphere is involved here. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states geometrically. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere or inside it.

The general form of a qubit density matrix is ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], where a + d = 1 because the trace is 1. For a pure state |ψ> = α|0> + β|1>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, which gives a pure state on the Bloch sphere.

But wait, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. Each term is a projector: |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ = [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. 

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries 1/2. What does this represent? I think that's the maximally mixed state. Because for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is the completely random state, which is when you have no information about the qubit's state.

Now, how is this represented on the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector r is related to the density matrix. The formula is something like r = [x, y, z], where:

x = (ρ_{01} + ρ_{10}) / 2
y = (ρ_{01} - ρ_{10}) / (2i)
z = (ρ_{00} - ρ_{11}) / 2

Wait, maybe I should double-check that. Another approach: for a density matrix ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z).

So let's see. If I write ρ as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, then comparing to the given ρ.

Our ρ is [[1/2,
