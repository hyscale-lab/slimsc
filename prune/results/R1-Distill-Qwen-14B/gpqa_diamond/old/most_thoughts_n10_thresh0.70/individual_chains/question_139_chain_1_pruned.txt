Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about two compounds, A and B, which are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment leads to the production of two different diketones. I need to select the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and HCl are commonly used in the formation of diazonium salts, especially from aromatic amines. But wait, the products here are diketones, which are ketones with two ketone groups. So maybe it's a different reaction?

Wait, another thought: I've heard about the Stephen reduction, but that's for nitro groups to amines. Or maybe it's the benzoin condensation? No, that's for ketones to form alcohols. Wait, perhaps it's the formation of a diketone from a diol under certain conditions?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's the acid-catalyzed dehydration of an alcohol to form a ketone. But wait, the treatment is with HCl, NaNO2, and water. That doesn't ring a bell for dehydration. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, sodium nitrite and HCl are often involved in diazotization, but that's usually with aromatic amines. But if the starting material is a secondary or tertiary amine, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's about the
