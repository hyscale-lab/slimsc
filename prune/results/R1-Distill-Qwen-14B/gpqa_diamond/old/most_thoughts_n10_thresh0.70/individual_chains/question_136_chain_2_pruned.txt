Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. So, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². And it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates.

Wait, first, I remember that the divergence of a vector field relates to how much the field is spreading out or converging at a point. And the divergence theorem connects the volume integral of divergence to the flux through the surface. Oh right, that's the Gauss's theorem. So maybe I can use that here instead of calculating the divergence directly.

But wait, the field here is given as f(r) = 1/r², but only along the radial direction. So, the vector field has components only in the r direction, and others (like theta and phi) are zero. So in spherical coordinates, the vector field is f = f_r(r) e_r, where e_r is the unit radial vector. And f_r(r) is 1/r².

So to find the divergence of f, I think the formula in spherical coordinates for divergence is important here. Let me recall: the divergence of a vector field A in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) * d(r² A_r) / dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/ sinθ) dA_φ/dφ. But wait, in this case, the vector field only has A_r component, and others are
