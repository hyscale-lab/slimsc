Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving through the galaxy. Let me see if I can figure this out.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame after 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I remember something about time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, their measurements of time and distance will differ. So the key here is to figure out the relationship between the time in one frame and the other, and how that affects the distance traveled.

Hmm, in the problem, time is given in the ejecta's frame—50 seconds. But I need the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So I think I need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame for those 50 seconds, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

Wait, no. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them. So the speed is 60,000 km/s as measured in the ejecta's frame? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, let's clarify. The problem states: From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that means in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because velocity is relative. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, no, wait. No, because the problem states that both are inertial frames. So if in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at v, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at -v, assuming they're moving directly towards each other. So the speed is 60,000 km/s in each frame but as opposite directions.

But then, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center, as per the Galaxy's frame. If I can find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame for the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, I can multiply speed by time to get distance.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. How do we find the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?

Oh, right. Time dilation. The time experienced in each frame is different because of relative velocity. The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/c²), but wait, maybe that's for another scenario. Alternatively, if the events are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame would differ.

Wait, more accurately, in special relativity
