Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's take a deep breath and think through it step by step. The question is about calculating the net potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems usually involves interactions between charges, but I need to recall the exact approach.

Alright, the setup: a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I'm supposed to find the potential energy of this system. The options are given, so I can check against them once I work through it.

Wait, what's the conducting sphere like? Since it's grounded, that means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge on it would be neutralized by the ground. Oh wait, no, if the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges will cause the sphere to remain at zero potential, right? Because the ground is at zero potential.

So when a charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges will adjust to keep the sphere's potential zero. Hmm, the method of images might be useful here. I remember that in electrostatics, especially for spherical conductors, we can model the induced charges using image charges.

Wait, the charge q is placed outside the sphere. So the conducting sphere will have induced charges on its surface. But because the sphere is grounded, the net charge on the sphere should be zero, right? Because any induced positive charges would cause electrons from the ground to flow onto the sphere, making the sphere have
