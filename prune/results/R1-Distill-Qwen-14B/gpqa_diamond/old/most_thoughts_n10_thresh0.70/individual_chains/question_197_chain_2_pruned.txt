Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are four different compounds, labeled A to D. 

First, I'll look at the IR and NMR data given for Compound X.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which probably indicates O-H or N-H stretching. Wait, but 3400 is a broad region, maybe for an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But let's check the other peaks. There's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The next peak at 1610 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm-1 could be from another aromatic ring vibration or maybe an alkyl group attached to something.

Now the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is usually a carboxylic acid proton. Because carboxylic protons are deshielded and appear around there, and they're typically broad due to hydrogen bonding. So that's a clue that maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet. But a broad peak is more like a carboxylic acid. So I'll tentatively say the compound has a -COOH group.

Looking at the rest:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region, so two protons as a doublet. That suggests substitution on a benzene ring. Two protons as a doublet usually means two equivalent protons adjacent to substituents. Maybe para-substituted, like a para-substituted benzene with two adjacent protons each as doublets.

Wait, if it's para, then the protons on either side would be equivalent, so maybe two doublets each integrating to two protons. So perhaps a di-substituted benzene ring, maybe with substituents in the para position.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. So this could be the other set of protons on the benzene ring, opposite the substituents.

Wait, combining the two aromatic signals: 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each a doublet of 2H. That's typical for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded and appear as doublets. So like a nit
