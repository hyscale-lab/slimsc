Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that there's a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. When they ran the 1H NMR on the crude compound, most of the spectrum looks as expected, except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each is about half a proton. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as a reason for the duplicate peaks. Hmm.

Wait, what's spin-spin coupling? Oh right, that's when a proton couples with another nearby proton, causing splitting. But the question says they've ruled that out because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that explanation. So it's not like one proton is splitting the other into a doublet or something like that.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis, they ran it at elevated temperature and saw two clearly defined peaks with equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So the mass is the same, but why two peaks?

Let me think about the possible options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have the molecular ion peak at a lower mass (since it's the starting material before a reaction step). But in the LC-MS, both peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule. So that probably isn't the issue.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular formula and same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. In terms of NMR, each enantiomer would have the same number of protons, same shifts because the environment is symmetric. Wait, but in the NMR, the alpha-proton is showing two peaks. For enantiomers, wouldn't the NMR look the same? Because the alpha proton's environment isn't any different; they're identical in each enantiomer. So why would there be two separate peaks? Maybe if the mixture isn't pure, but in that case, the NMR would show a singlet with integral 1H, not two. Unless there's some other factor like slow exchange or diastereotopic protons. Wait, but the problem says the peaks have similar shifts and same mass, but enantiomers have same mass anyway. If the sample was a racemic mixture, the NMR would still show all the same peaks as a pure sample because enantiomers don't split each other. So this might not explain the two NMR peaks.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling? I'm not very clear on that, but maybe it refers to a situation where one proton is coupling with two different sets. Wait, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not a simple splitting between two protons. Maybe something else is causing the splitting. Alternatively, maybe during the amide bond formation, some
