Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again and try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams, and they're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through three tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Also, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temperature and pressure.

The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by understanding what each tube does.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, but it's anhydrous. When it reacts with moisture, it gains weight. So if the gas mixture has water vapor, it would be absorbed here. So the 3.60g increase is likely due to water (H2O) in the gas.

Wait, but what's the formula? Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with H2O. But I think when H2O vapor passes through Mg(ClO4)2, it would form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, increasing the weight by the mass of water.

So the mass gained is the mass of H2O. So 3.60g of H2O. Let's confirm that. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O.

So tube 1 absorbed 0.2 mol of H2O.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. This is a basic solution. If the gas has CO2, it would react. The reaction is CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3↓ + H2O. So if the weight didn't change, that suggests that no CO2 was absorbed. So maybe CO2 wasn't present, or it was completely absorbed by another part? Wait, but the solution's weight didn't change. So perhaps all the CO2 was already absorbed in tube 1? Or maybe there was no CO2 in the gas mixture.

Wait, but wait. If the gas passed through Ca(OH)2 solution, and the solution's weight didn't change, that implies no CO2 was present. Because if CO2 were present, it would have reacted, increasing the mass. So perhaps CO2 wasn't in the gas mixture? Or maybe it was all consumed elsewhere. Hmm, but the only other place is tube 3.

Tube 3: red-hot copper. That's probably reacting with a gas that can oxidize copper. Maybe SO2 or H2S?
