Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's take it step by step.

The problem involves two mixtures, X and Y, and a substance Z. The key seems to be figuring out what each of these is based on the given information.

First, let's go through the problem statement again:

- Mixture X is equimolar and decolorizes bromine water. So when bromine (Br2) water is added, it turns colorless. That usually means the compound has double bonds because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine. So X likely contains alkenes or alkynes.

- When X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is also equimolar but consists of different liquids. Importantly, Y does not decolorize bromine water. So whatever reaction happened, the products don't have double bonds anymore because bromine doesn't react with them. Pt is a catalyst, usually for hydrogenation or dehydrogenation.

Wait, but the reaction is a disproportionation. Oh right, that's a reaction where one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So in this case, X must be a substance that can undergo such a reaction.

After this reaction, when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed. Then, both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, give only substance Z. So, hydrogenation of Y gives Z, and hydrogenation of X also gives Z. So Z must be something that's the fully hydrogenated form of both X and Y. 

Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate that. Mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 14.28% → 0.1428. Let's denote Z as CnH2m. The formula would be:

(2m) / (12n + 2m) = 0.1428.

Hmm, let's solve for n and m. Let's rearrange:

2m = 0.1428 * (12n + 2m)

Multiply both sides by 1000: 2000m = 142.8*(12n + 2m)
Wait, maybe a better approach. Let me express 14.28% as 1/7 approximately (since 1/7 is about 14.28%). So 2m/(12n + 2m) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying: 14m = 12n + 2m → 12m = 12n → m = n.

So Z is CnH2n. That's a structure where each carbon has two hydrogens, so it's a saturated molecule. What's such a molecule? It could be an alkane, but wait, alkanes are CnH2n+2. Oh no, wait—no, wait. Wait, alkane is CnH2n+2. So if Z is CnH2n, that would imply each carbon has two hydrogens, but that's not possible for an alkane. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the mass fraction. Z is a hydrocarbon, so it's CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 14.28% ≈ 1/7.

So, 1/(12n + m) * m = 1/7 → m/(12n +m) = 1/7 → 7m=12n +m →6m=12n →m=2n.

So m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n. That's a structure where each carbon has two hydrogens. Wait, but that would make it a cycloalkane like cyclopropane, cyclobutane, etc., because each carbon in a cycloalkane has two Hs if it's a monocyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkene, but no, because Z doesn't react further with hydrogen—that would suggest it's an alkane.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's do it again. So:

Hydrogen mass fraction = (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let me write 0.1428 as approximately 1/7
