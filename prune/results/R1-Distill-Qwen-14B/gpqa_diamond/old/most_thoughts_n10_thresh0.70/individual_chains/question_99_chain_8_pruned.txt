Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. I remember that FTIR is good for identifying functional groups based on absorption peaks, and NMR tells us about the structure and environment of the protons.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Oh wait, because a broad peak around 3000 is often a broad O-H stretch. And then there's a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H and a strong carbonyl around 1700. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, I see that all the compounds end with COOH except maybe some, so let me check. Option A: ends with CH2COOH. Option B: COOH. Option C: CH2COOH. Option D: COOH. So all have a COOH group except maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking again:

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So yes, ends with COOH. So all options have a COOH group? Hmm, no, because another option is CH3CH2...COOH. Wait, all of them have COOH? Let me check. All four options have COOH as the last part. So the functional group is a carboxylic acid. So the FTIR data fits that because the broad peak is the O-H of the acid, and the carbonyl is from the COOH.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The NMR shows several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent protons? So the structure doesn't have any double bonds, so maybe it's a saturated molecule. All the options here are branched alkanes with a COOH group, so that's consistent.

In the NMR, there are two specific signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about how splitting works. Each splitting indicates coupling with neighboring protons. So a quartet is from coupling with three equivalent protons. A triplet is from two, and a doublet from one.

Wait, but the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So let me break it down. Suppose a proton has three different neighboring groups. So each of those neighbors would cause splitting. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to more than one set of neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from being adjacent to two different
