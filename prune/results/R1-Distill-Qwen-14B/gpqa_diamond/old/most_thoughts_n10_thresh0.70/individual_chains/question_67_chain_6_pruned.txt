Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, p orbitals have l=1, right? Because the p orbital is denoted by l=1.

The problem states that the coupled angular momentum state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so l1 is 1, l2 is 1, and the total l is 2, with m being -1. I think that makes sense because when you couple two angular momenta with l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l values are 2, 1, and 0. So 2 is one of the possibilities.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. And we're supposed to find the joint probability that both measurements give -침. Oh, wait, I remember that the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is related to the possible m values, which are from -l to +l in integer steps. So for each particle, L1z can have eigenvalues m1*침 where m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for L2z.

But wait, the problem says to ignore spin angular momentum, so we're only considering the orbital part. So each electron's orbital angular momentum Lz can be -침, 0, or +침. So for each particle, each eigenvalue is one of those.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me think about how this state is constructed. The coupled state is a combination of the individual states. So the total state is a product state? Or is it a combination? Hmm.

Wait, I think when you couple two angular momenta, you have to consider how the individual states combine to form the total. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a specific state in the coupled basis. But when we make a measurement of individual L1z and L2z, we might have to express this coupled state in terms of the product basis states.

The product basis states are |l1, m1> |l2, m2>. So to find the probability of getting m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, we need to express the given coupled state as a linear combination of these product states and find the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1>.

Wait, so the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> would be a linear combination of the |m1, m2> states that add up to m_total = -1. Because m = m1 + m2.

So m1 + m2 = -1. So possible pairs (m1, m2) are: (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) but wait, wait, m can't be beyond the allowed values for each. Since each m can be -1, 0, +1, m2 can't be -2. So the only possible pairs are m1= -1, m2=0;
