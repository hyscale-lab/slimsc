Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its characterization data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are A, B, C, D respectively.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, sometimes it could also be from aldehydes or other compounds with -OH groups. Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O). Now, where else could a peak at 1650 appear? Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a ketone or an ester, or perhaps an amine? But wait, an amine would have a NH stretch around 3300-3500, which isn't mentioned here. Alternatively, the 1650 could be from an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, which is usually in that range. But wait, in IR, aromatic C=C are usually around 1600, so maybe that's not it. Another thought: maybe the 1650 is another type of carbonyl, but different from the 1700? Like an conjugated carbonyl? Or maybe an ester's carbonyl is around 1700, and perhaps the 1650 is from another group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have an alkene group. So, the structure probably contains a double bond. That suggests maybe something like an ester with an alkene,
