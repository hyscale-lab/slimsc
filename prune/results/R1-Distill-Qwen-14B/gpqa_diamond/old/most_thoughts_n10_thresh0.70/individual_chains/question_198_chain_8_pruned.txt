Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Let's see. The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. Hmm, I remember stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's β4=16, which is lower than β3. Interesting, so the complexes' stability increases up to β3 and then drops for β4? Or maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Oh, wait, β values are for the complexes Co(SCN)_n^2−n. So each β corresponds to a different n. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^(2−), I think. Because each SCN adds a charge of -1, and Co is +2. So for n=1: Co(SCN) → +2 + (-1) = +1 → charge is +1. For n=2: Co(SCN)_2 → +2 + (-2) = 0. n=3: +2 -3 = -1. n=4: +2 -4 = -2. So the β for each step is given. Wait, no, wait: the stability constant is for the formation of the complex. So each β is for the step where another SCN- ligand attaches.

Wait, no, I think the stability constants are for the overall formation of each complex. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2−}.

But wait, the problem says the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=4
