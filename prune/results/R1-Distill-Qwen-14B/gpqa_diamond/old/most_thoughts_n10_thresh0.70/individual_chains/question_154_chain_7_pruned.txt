Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures.

First, let's look at the data provided. The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%). There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes indicate the molecular weight, but here we have two peaks. The 158 is close to 156, so maybe something to do with isotopes? Chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope, Cl-35 and Cl-37. Wait, so if the molecule has a chlorine atom, the molecular ion could be a combination of Cl-35 and Cl-37. Let me think: the molecular weight would be the average, but the isotopic peaks would be at m/z = molecular weight Â± 2. Because Cl-35 is 35, Cl-37 is 37. So if the molecular weight is 156, then the Cl would cause a peak at 156+2=158 and 156-2=154, assuming the rest of the molecule is using the most abundant isotopes. Wait, but in the given data, there's a peak at 158 but nothing at 154. Oh, but maybe the molecular formula has more than one Cl? Or perhaps only one Cl. Let me calculate the possible molecular formula.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156. Let's think about possible molecular formulas. The options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Then adding 3Cl (wait, no: 3-chloro is one Cl). Wait, no: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would be Cl attached to the 3rd position. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate that: C is 12*7=84, H is 5, Cl is ~35.5, O is 16*2=32. So 84 +5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5 + 32=156.5. So molecular weight is around 156.5, which would match the m/z 156. And the isotope would be 156 and 158. Because Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the peak at 158 would be due to the Cl-37 isotope. So the molecular ion is at 156 (Cl-35), and the 158 would be Cl-37. So the 158 peak is an isotopic peak, which explains why it's at 32% intensity. That makes sense because the natural abundance of Cl-37 is about 33%. So the molecular formula would fit this data.

Moving on to the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe a carboxylic acid (which has a broad O-H stretch) or an alcohol. But wait, the sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong peak. Common functional groups with that peak: carbonyl groups. So, either a ket
