Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. I need to find the energy of the RHIC that would give the nucleus this speed. The options are given in GeV, so the answer will probably be something around there.

Wait, what's the nucleus X? Oh, right, it's defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and usually 4 neutrons (like Li-7). But wait, here it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I need to find its rest mass. Hmm, the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. But I'm a bit rusty on exact values. Let me think: the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, but wait. The actual mass of the nucleus isn't just the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh right, the mass defect comes into play. But for heavy ions, the rest mass is approximately the sum of the individual nucleon masses minus the binding energy. But wait, since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, I need the rest mass correctly because the energy is calculated using gamma times the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as a given value. Hmm, but I don't have that value on hand. Wait, maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the approximate rest mass of Li-6. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 931
