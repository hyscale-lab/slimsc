Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question is asking for the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I think is T = T_star * ( L_star / (16πσd^2) )^(1/4) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's more straightforward. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because the formula is T ∝ (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), and since d is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law, which says P² ∝ d³. So combining these, T should be proportional to (1/P^(3/2))^(1/4) ) = 1/P^(3/8). Hmm, wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So a³ ∝ P². So a ∝ P^(2/3). Then, the flux from the star is F = L/(4πa²). So the flux is inversely proportional to a², which is (P^(2/3))² = P^(4/3). So F ∝ 1/P^(4/3).

The equilibrium temperature formula: T = [ (L/(16πσa²) ) ]^(1/4). But since L is the star's luminosity and it's the same for all planets, the temperature is proportional to (1/(a²))^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). Since a ∝ P^(2/3), then T ∝ 1/(P^(2/3 * 1/2)) ) = 1/(P^(1/3)). So T ∝ P^(-1/3).

So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait. Because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so T4 = T0 * (1/P4)^(1/3), and T2 = T0 * (1/P2)^(1/3). So the ratio T4/T2 = [ (1/P4)^(1/3) ] / [ (1/P2)^(1/3) ) ] = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because when you invert it, so (1/P4) divided by (1/P2) is (P2/P4), and then raised to 1/3.

So I need to find the ratio of P2 to P4.

Looking at the given ratios: the periods are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so the periods of the planets are in the ratio 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5.

So Planet_2 has a period of 2 units, Planet_4 has 3.5 units. So P2 = 2, P4 = 3.5.

So the ratio P2/P4 is 2 / 3.5. Let me compute that: 2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 2/(7/2) )= 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (0.5714)^(1/3) is the ratio T4/T2.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me double-check: since T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So 2/3.5 is 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So the cube root of 0.5714.

I know that the cube of 0.8 is 0.512, because 0.8^3 = 0.512. And 0.83^3 is about 0.83*0.83=0.6889, *0.83 again is around 0.568. So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571787.

Wait, 0.83 cubed: let me compute 0.83 * 0.83 = 68.89 * 10^-2 = 0.6889. Then 0.6889 *0.83: 0.6889 * 0.8 is 0.55112, 0.6889 *0.03=0.020667. Adding them gives about 0.571787. So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571787, which is very close to 4/7 (≈0.571428). So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait wait, but let me think again. The temperature ratio is T4 over T2. So if T ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then T4 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) * T2.

So the ratio T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( P^{-1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. This relationship arises because the equilibrium temperature depends on the flux received from the star, which scales with \( P^{-4/3} \), and the flux is then raised to the \( 1/4 \) power in the temperature formula.

Given the orbital periods of the planets in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), we identify the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 as \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), respectively. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

Taking the cube root of \( 0.5714 \), we find:

\[
\left( 0.5714 \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \), which corresponds to option C.
