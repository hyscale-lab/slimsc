Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let me start by going through what I know about qPCR and calibration curves. 

So the scientist ran a qPCR with a positive control that's been diluted in a series. He took three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which is perfect because that means each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly—so the calibration curve should be spot on. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration plot (which is usually Ct vs log concentration) is related to the efficiency. The formula for slope is -3.32 divided by the efficiency. Since efficiency here is 100% (or 1), 3.32/1 is 3.32, so a slope of -3.3 is really close to that. So all the math there checks out.

Looking at the data, the Ct values for each concentration are in triplicates. For example, 100000 copies have Ct values of 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2. Similarly, each subsequent dilution (10x lower each time) has Ct values that are about 3.3 cycles higher. Wait, let's see: 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution. The Ct goes from ~34 to ~30.6, which is a difference of about 3.4 cycles. Hmm. But wait, each 10-fold dilution should correspond to an increase of roughly 3.32 Ct values because with 100% efficiency, each cycle doubles the DNA. So for a 10-fold dilution, you need 3.32 cycles to get from, say, 10 copies to 100 copies. 

Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies in the results. So looking at the options, what could cause the Ct values to vary more than expected?

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But that's not true because he got a good R² and perfect efficiency. So A is wrong.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with target amount. But wait, all his data seems to align with each 10-fold dilution increasing Ct by about 3.3. So B might not be the issue.

Option C states that a ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, no, because a ten-fold should be about 3.32 cycles. So a ten-fold isn't more than that; perhaps the opposite? So I'm not sure. Maybe C is pointing out that the observed Ct difference is more than expected.

Wait, looking at the data: The Ct for 100,000 is around 34, and 10,000 is around 30.6. The difference is 34-30.6=3.4. So that's about right
