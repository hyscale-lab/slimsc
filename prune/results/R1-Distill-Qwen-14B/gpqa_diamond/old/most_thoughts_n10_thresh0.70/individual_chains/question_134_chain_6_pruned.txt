Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. Oh wait, but wait, I need to consider each acid and base reaction separately here, right?

First, I think I should figure out how much of each acid and base is present in moles. Because the neutralization reactions depend on the mole ratios.

So starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, and it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions.

The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = M * V. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. That gives 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, it can donate two H+ ions. The formula should be H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+.

The volume is 300 mL, 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. So 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Multiply by 2 for H+ → 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. Let me think. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

The volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. So moles Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives two OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but then we have a neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this is typically about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact value. Oh right, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids with strong bases is around -57.3 kJ/mol, but that's for a monoprotic acid and a monobasic base. But in this case, the base is diprotic because Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions per formula unit.

Wait, but the neutralization is all about the H+ and OH- reacting. So regardless of the source, each H+ and OH- will combine. So the total moles of H+ and OH- will determine how much heat is released.

Wait, the total H+ is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles. So the limiting reagent is OH- since there's less of it. So only 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, what's the exact stoichiometry? H+ + OH- → H2O, so 1:1. So the H+ is in excess. So the amount that reacts is 0.2 moles.

So the heat released would be 0.2 moles * 57.3 kJ/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. But wait, I'm not sure if I should use 57.3 per mole or per mole of H+ or per mole of H2O. Oh right, because each mole of H+ and OH- makes one mole of H2O, so yeah, 57.3 kJ per mole.

Wait, but wait, I recall that sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -57.3 kJ per mole of acid, but that depends on whether it's per mole of H+ or per mole of acid. For example, HCl is monoprotic, so each mole gives 1 mole of H+. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+.

But when considering neutralization, each mole of H+ contributes to the reaction. So in this case, we have 0.28 moles H+ from acids, but only 0.2 moles OH-.

So the reaction uses up all the OH- and 0.2 moles of H+.

So the moles of H2O formed are 0.2 moles, and the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) kJ = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but 11.46 is about 11.46 kJ, which is not exactly matching any of the options. Hmm. Or is there a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, let me
