Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that relativistic energy depends on gamma, which is the Lorentz factor. So the formula for the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

But wait, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. So first, I need to find gamma for this speed. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v squared over c squared). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, which is too low. 0.28 *3.5 is 0.98, so 3.5714 times 0.28 is approximately 1. So yes, gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) accurately. So 0.96^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is exactly 100/28 = approximately 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c^2. So I need the mass of Li-6. The atomic mass unit (u) is known, and 1u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So I need to find the mass of Li-6 in u.

Li has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron about 1.008665 u. So the mass of Li-6 is 3*(proton) + 3*(neutron).

Let me compute that. 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u. 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u. Adding them together: 3.021828 +3.025995 = 6.047823 u. So the mass is approximately 6.047823 u.

Wait, but wait, I think I should use the exact values. Let me get the precise numbers. Proton mass is about 1.007276 u, neutron is 1.008664 u? Or maybe I should check more precise values. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value for Li-6 is known. But I'll proceed with the calculation.

So the mass is 6.047823 u. Now, converting u to MeV/c²: 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.047823 *931.5 ≈ 0.047823 *900 = 43.04, and 0.047823 *31.5= ~1.506. So total approx 43.04 +1.506=44.546. So total is 5589 +44.546= 5633.546 MeV. So approximately 5633.55 MeV, which is about 5.63355 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately:

6.047823 * 931.5 = ?

Let me break it down:

6 * 931.5 = 5589
0.047823 *931.5 = ?

Calculating 0.047823 *900 =43.0407
0.047823 *31.5 = let's compute 0.047823 *30=1.43469, and 0.047823 *1.5=0.0717345. So total is 1.43469 +0.0717345 =1.5064245.

So 43.0407 +1.5064245 =44.5471245.

Adding to 5589 gives 5589 +44.5471245 =5633.5471245 MeV, which is 5.633547 GeV approximately.

So the rest mass energy of Li-6 is approximately 5.6335 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by this rest mass energy. Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so 5.6335 GeV * 3.5714 ≈ ?

Let me compute 5 *3.5714 =17.857 GeV. 0.6335 *3.5714 ≈ 2.261 GeV.

Adding together: 17.857 +2.261 =20.118 GeV.

Wait, but wait, more accurately:

5.6335 *3.5714.

Let me compute 5 *3.5714 =17.857.

0.6335 *3.5714.

Compute 3.5714 * 0.6 is 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0335 = let's compute 3.5714 *0.03=0.107142, 3.5714 *0.0035=0.0125. So total 0.107142 +0.0125=0.119642.

So total for 0.6335 is 2.14284 +0.119642=2.26248.

Add to 17.857: 17.857 +2.26248=20.11948 GeV.

So approximately 20.119 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is higher. Option B is 23.069, which is way higher. Option A is 18.475, which is lower.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check gamma.

Wait, v=0.96c. So beta is 0.96, beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. Square root is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428... which is exactly 25/7.

So 25/7 is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy: perhaps I should use more precise values for the masses of the proton and neutron.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think, the exact mass can be found from the periodic table. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard mass excess values.

Wait, another approach: the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the mass defect. But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should get the exact mass of Li-6 in u.

Wait, I think the accurate mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 u, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should reference the standard data. For example, the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 u.

Wait, if that's the case, then the rest mass energy would be 6.0151 u *931.5 MeV/u.

So 6.0151 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0151 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.005 *931.5=4.6575. So 0.015 *931.5=13.9725. Then 0.0001 *931.5=0.09315. So 0.0151 *931.5=13.9725 +0.09315=14.06565 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.06565 =5603.06565 MeV, which is 5.60306565 GeV.

Hmm, so using a more precise mass of 6.0151 u, the rest mass energy is approximately 5.6031 GeV.

Now, multiply this by gamma (3.5714).

5.6031 *3.5714 ≈ ?

Let me compute 5 *3.5714 =17.857.

0.6031 *3.5714.

Compute 0.6 *3.5714 =2.14284.

0.0031 *3.5714 ≈0.011071.

So 2.14284 +0.011071 ≈2.15391.

So total energy is 17.857 +2.15391=20.01091 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.011 GeV. But earlier when I used 6.0478 u, I got around 20.119 GeV. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I confused the mass of Li-6. Let me think again. The isotope Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The exact mass can be found using the atomic mass data. Let me look up the exact value. 

Wait, in reality, the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units. So the rest mass energy is 6.0151 *931.5 MeV ≈5.603 GeV.

So using that, gamma is 25/7 ≈3.5714.

So 5.603 GeV *3.5714 ≈5.603 *3.5714.

Compute 5 *3.5714 =17.857.

0.603 *3.5714 = ?

0.6 *3.5714 =2.14284.
0.003 *3.5714≈0.0107142.

Adding to 2.14284 +0.0107142=2.153554.

So total energy is 17.857 +2.153554=20.010554 GeV.

So approximately 20.01 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly that. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, 20.01 is closest to option C (20.132) but a bit lower. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 6.0151 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.0151 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.0151 *931.5 =14.06565.

So total is 5589 +14.06565=5603.06565 MeV =5.60306565 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7=3.571428571.

So 5.60306565 *3.571428571 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

5.60306565 *3 =16.80919695.

5.60306565 *0.571428571 ≈ ?

0.571428571 is approximately 4/7.

Compute 5.60306565 * (4/7) = (5.60306565 *4)/7 =22.4122626 /7 ≈3.2017518.

So total is 16.80919695 +3.2017518 ≈20.01094875 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Hmm, the option C is 20.132 GeV. There's a discrepancy of about 0.12 GeV. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6. Let me check. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151019 u. Let's use this value.

So 6.0151019 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.0151019 *931.5 = ?

0.0151019 *900 =13.59171.

0.0151019 *31.5=0.474903 (since 0.0151019 *30=0.453057, 0.0151019 *1.5=0.02265285; sum is 0.453057 +0.02265285=0.47570985.)

So 0.0151019 *931.5=13.59171 +0.47570985=14.06741985.

Thus, total is 5589 +14.06741985=5603.06741985 MeV, which is 5.60306742 GeV.

So again, 5.60306742 GeV *3.571428571 ≈20.011 GeV.

So why is my calculation not matching any of the options except C, which is 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the mass number without considering the exact isotope mass. For heavy ions, sometimes the mass is approximated as A u, where A is the mass number. So for Li-6, A=6, so 6 u.

So 6 u *931.5 MeV/u =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Then, 5.589 GeV *3.5714=?

5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.589 *3.5714≈2.107.

Total=17.857+2.107=19.964 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.96 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132), but still not matching exactly.

Wait, but I think the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 u. So using that, the calculation is about 20.01 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

=1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Wait, but perhaps I need to compute gamma more precisely. Let's compute 1 -v^2/c^2 with more precision.

v=0.96c → v²= (0.96)^2 c²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²= 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the energy is given per nucleon? No, the question states the nucleus X, so the energy should be the total for the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Oh! Wait, no, the question says the energy of the RHIC. RHIC is a collider, so the energy given is the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy?

Wait, no, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy per particle, but sometimes people refer to the total energy (which includes rest mass). Wait, but the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps it's the kinetic energy.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because sometimes, the kinetic energy is what's given to the particle. So the total energy is gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, the question states "energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the RHIC's energy would be the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Ah, that's probably the mistake I made earlier. Because in colliders, the energy figure usually refers to the kinetic energy. So let me recalculate.

The kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) m c².

So gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma -1=2.57142857.

So K=2.57142857 *5.60306742 GeV.

Wait, the rest mass energy is 5.60306742 GeV.

So K=2.57142857 *5.60306742.

Compute 2 *5.603067=11.206134.

0.57142857 *5.603067.

0.5 *5.603067=2.8015335.

0.07142857 *5.603067≈0.40135.

So 2.8015335 +0.40135≈3.2028835.

So total K=11.206134 +3.2028835=14.4090175 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 14.409 GeV. But that doesn't match any of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The energy in colliders is often given as the center-of-mass energy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, but when a nucleus is accelerated in a collider, the energy given is the kinetic energy. So the total energy is gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

So perhaps the energy provided by RHIC is the kinetic energy, because RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain speed, and the energy is their kinetic energy.

So in that case, the calculation would be (gamma -1) * m c².

So let me compute that.

gamma =3.57142857

gamma -1=2.57142857.

m c²=5.60306742 GeV.

So K=2.57142857 *5.60306742.

Let me compute this accurately.

5.60306742 *2 =11.20613484.

5.60306742 *0.57142857 ≈?

0.57142857 is 4/7. So 5.60306742 *4=22.41226968. Divide by 7: 22.41226968 /7 ≈3.20175281.

So K=11.20613484 +3.20175281≈14.40788765 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value either. The options are 18, 20,21,23 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy (gamma * m c²). Earlier calculation was ~20 GeV.

But the options don't have 20 GeV, except option C is 20.132.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe the nucleus is lithium-6, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The exact mass is 6.0151 u. So 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u=5.60306 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So total energy E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60306 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.60306 =16.80918.

0.57142857 *5.60306.

Compute 0.5 *5.60306=2.80153.

0.07142857 *5.60306= approx 0.40136.

So 2.80153 +0.40136=3.20289.

So E=16.80918 +3.20289=20.01207 GeV.

So approximately 20.012 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60306742.

Breaking it into parts:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60306742.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.00306742≈0.011 (approx).

So 2.14285714 +0.011=2.15385714.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.15385714=20.011 GeV.

Hmm, but why is option C 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151019 u.

So 6.0151019 *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0151019 *931.5=14.0674 MeV.

Total=5603.0674 MeV=5.6030674 GeV.

So again, the same value.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic speeds correctly. Wait, no, I think the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the mass number A=6, but without considering the exact isotope mass. So m c²=6 *931.5 MeV=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *m c²=3.5714 *5.589=?

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.5714 *5.589≈3.196.

So E=16.767 +3.196=20. (approx 19.963). Close to 20 GeV.

But again, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute beta=0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²)=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps using more precise calculation, like using beta=0.960000000.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) exactly. 0.0784 is 784/10000=196/2500= (14^2)/(50^2). So sqrt(196/2500)=14/50=0.28. So it's exact.

Thus, gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy in units of GeV without considering the rest mass, but that doesn't make sense because it's a nucleus, so rest mass can't be neglected.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me check again.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: 1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: 1.008665 u.

So 3*(1.007276 +1.008665)=3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

Wait, but earlier I thought Li-6 is 6.0151 u. So this is conflicting.

Wait, wait, this is a mistake. Because the atomic mass of a nucleus is not simply the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. But in the case of calculating the rest mass energy, perhaps the mass is taken as the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, no, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of mass defect.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. The rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons minus the mass defect (which is converted into binding energy).

So, if I take the sum as 3 protons +3 neutrons, which is 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) =3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 u, which is less.

So the rest mass energy is 6.0151 u *931.5 MeV/u=5.603 GeV.

Thus, earlier calculation seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy. Let's recalculate K=(gamma-1) * m c².

Gamma-1=2.57142857.

m c²=5.603 GeV.

So K=2.57142857 *5.603= ?

Compute 2.57142857 *5.603.

Break it down: 2 *5.603=11.206.

0.57142857 *5.603.

0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.07142857 *5.603≈0.4013.

So 2.8015 +0.4013=3.2028.

Total K=11.206 +3.2028=14.4088 GeV.

But the options don't have this value.

Wait, but perhaps the question is referring to the total energy (gamma m c²), which is about 20 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than my calculation of 20.01 GeV.

Could there be a miscalculation in the mass?

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 u.

So 6.0151 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.0151 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.0151 *931.5=14.06715.

Total=5603.06715 MeV=5.60306715 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *m c²=3.57142857 *5.60306715.

Let me compute this precisely:

3.57142857 *5.60306715.

I'll compute this as:

5.60306715 *3 =16.80920145.

5.60306715 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.60306715 *0.5=2.801533575.

5.60306715 *0.07142857= approx 0.401359.

So 2.801533575 +0.401359=3.202892575.

Total E=16.80920145 +3.202892575=20.01209403 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0121 GeV.

Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps my calculation is a bit off due to approximations?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of the exact gamma value without approximating gamma as 3.5714.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) where beta=0.96.

Compute beta²=0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - beta²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

Exactly. So no error there.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check another source.

Wait, I just looked up the exact mass of Li-6. According to standard tables, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151019 u.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of the rest mass without considering the exact isotope, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed.

Wait, the question says 0.96c, so that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the fact that I'm using the rest mass energy as m*c², but perhaps the problem expects the use of the mass number times the atomic mass unit times 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, but that's what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise calculations.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60306715.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 =25/7.

5.60306715 =5.60306715.

25/7 *5.60306715 = (25 *5.60306715)/7.

25 *5.60306715 =140.07667875.

Divide by 7: 140.07667875/7=20.01095411 GeV.

So approximately 20.01095 GeV.

So still about 20.011 GeV.

Hmm, but option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the question is expecting the use of a different mass, like the mass number times a different constant.

Wait, what if I used 931.5 MeV/u as 931.5 exactly, but perhaps I should use more precise value, like 931.494 MeV/u.

So 6.0151 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0151 *931.494 =14.066 MeV.

Total=5603.03 MeV=5.60303 GeV.

So E=gamma *m c²=3.57142857 *5.60303.

Which is 3.57142857 *5.60303 = ?

As before, this is roughly 20.0109 GeV.

Hmm, same result.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but the closest one is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: the problem says 'the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c'. So perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, but I computed it earlier as ~14.4 GeV, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the total energy, and the question expects a more precise calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma to more decimal places.

gamma=3.5714285714285714.

m c²=5.60306715 GeV.

So E=3.5714285714285714 *5.60306715.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.5714285714285714 *5.60306715:

Break it down:

3 *5.60306715 =16.80920145.

0.5714285714285714 *5.60306715.

Compute 0.5 *5.60306715 =2.801533575.

0.0714285714285714 *5.60306715.

Compute 0.0714285714285714 *5.60306715.

0.07 *5.60306715 =0.3922147005.

0.0014285714285714 *5.60306715 ≈0.00799999999.

So 0.3922147005 +0.00799999999≈0.400214699.

So 2.801533575 +0.400214699=3.201748274.

Total E=16.80920145 +3.201748274=20.01094972 GeV.

So again, about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic energy formula with the rest energy as m c², and gamma computed as 3.5714, leading to 20.01 GeV. Since option C is the closest, but is 20.132, which is a bit higher, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the momentum and use the relativistic energy formula.

Wait, the energy E is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But since the speed is given, I can find p using p= gamma m v.

v=0.96c.

p=gamma m v = gamma m (0.96 c).

But E is gamma m c^2. So the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the rest mass of the nucleus in terms of its mass number times u, but without considering binding energy. So for Li-6, m =6 u.

So m=6u → m c²=6 *931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.589 GeV=3.5714 *5.589=?

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.5714 *5.589= approx 3.199.

Total E=16.767 +3.199=20. (approx 19.966 GeV).

Close to 20 GeV.

Hmm, again, option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.60306715 using a calculator.

3.57142857 ×5.60306715.

Let me compute this:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.60306715.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.00306715.

0.00306715 ×3.57142857 ≈0.011.

So 2.14285714 +0.011=2.15385714.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.15385714=20.011 GeV.

Hmm, so I'm consistently getting around 20.01 GeV.

So none of the options match exactly. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem used a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of gamma is more accurately done as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of beta =v/c=0.96, leading to gamma=7.0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because gamma would be 7 only if beta is sqrt(1 - (1/49))=sqrt(48/49)=sqrt(0.97959)=0.9897..., which is higher than 0.96.

So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me see:

Option D is 21.419 GeV.

Which would be if gamma is higher, like gamma=3.82.

Wait, 3.82 *5.603=21.42 GeV.

So gamma=3.82 would imply beta= sqrt(1-1/(3.82)^2)=sqrt(1-1/14.59)=sqrt(0.9344)=approx 0.9669, which is higher than 0.96.

So that's not matching.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, but the question is asking for the kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me compute 6.0151 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.0151 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.0151 *931.5=14.06715.

Total 5603.06715 MeV=5.60306715 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is approximately 20.01 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV), but perhaps the problem intended to use a different mass or approximated gamma to 3.57, leading to 20.13 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option D, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as the sum of protons and neutrons without considering binding energy, i.e., 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665)=6.047823 u.

So m c²=6.047823 u *931.5 MeV/u=5.646 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.646=3.5714 *5.646=?

3 *5.646=16.938.

0.5714 *5.646≈3.217.

So E=16.938+3.217=20.155 GeV.

Hmm, that's closer to option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Ah, perhaps that's the case.

So if the problem uses the sum of individual proton and neutron masses, not accounting for the binding energy (which actually makes the nucleus lighter), then the rest mass is higher.

In that case, m c²=6.047823 u *931.5 MeV/u=5.646 GeV.

Then, E=3.5714 *5.646=?

3.5714 *5=17.857.

3.5714 *0.646= approx 2.315.

Total E=17.857+2.315=20.172 GeV.

Hmm, which is about 20.172 GeV, close to option C's 20.132 GeV.

But perhaps the precise calculation would yield 20.132 GeV.

So maybe the correct approach is to use the sum of individual protons and neutrons, leading to a higher mass and thus higher energy.

In that case, the calculation would be:

m=6.047823 u → m c²=6.047823 *931.5=5645.99 MeV=5.64599 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.64599.

Compute precisely:

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.64599= ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.04599= ?

0.04 *3.57142857=0.14285714.

0.00599 *3.57142857≈0.021366.

So total 0.14285714 +0.021366=0.164223.

So 2.14285714 +0.164223=2.30708014.

So E=17.85714285 +2.30708014=20.164223 GeV≈20.164 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.164 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132) and option D (21.419), but closer to C.

Wait, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit lower than this.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the rest mass to be calculated as A * u, where A=6, so 6 *931.5=5.589 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.589=3.5714 *5.589=?

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.5714 *5.589=3.199.

Total E=16.767 +3.199=20. (approx 19.966 GeV).

Hmm.

But this doesn't match any option exactly.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, considering that the problem expects the sum of individual masses without binding energy.

In that case, using m=6.047823 u, leading to E=20.164 GeV, which is close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a slightly different gamma.

Wait, perhaps using a more precise gamma.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

So, using m=6.047823 u:

m c²=6.047823 *931.5=5645.99 MeV=5.64599 GeV.

E=gamma *m c²=3.57142857 *5.64599=?

Compute 3.57142857 *5.64599.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.64599=2.30708.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.30708=20.16422 GeV.

Hmm, but the option is 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses gamma=7.0, which would be for beta=sqrt(1 -1/49)=sqrt(48/49)=sqrt(0.97959)=0.9897c, which is higher than 0.96c. So that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate gamma using beta=0.96 and the formula gamma=(1-beta^2)^(-1/2).

Well, I think I've exhausted all approaches, and the closest option to the correct calculation is option C, 20.132 GeV. Perhaps due to rounding differences.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( v = 0.96c \), and \( m c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Rest Mass Energy of Li-6
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the atomic mass of Li-6 (\( 6.0151 \, \text{u} \)) and the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.0151 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5.6031 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6031 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
- \( 3 \times 5.6031 = 16.8093 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( 0.5714 \times 5.6031 \approx 3.2029 \, \text{GeV} \)

Adding these gives:

\[
E \approx 16.8093 + 3.2029 = 20.0122 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0122 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The discrepancy between the calculated value (\( 20.0122 \, \text{GeV} \)) and option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)) may arise from rounding or slight differences in the assumed mass of Li-6. However, option C is the closest match.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
