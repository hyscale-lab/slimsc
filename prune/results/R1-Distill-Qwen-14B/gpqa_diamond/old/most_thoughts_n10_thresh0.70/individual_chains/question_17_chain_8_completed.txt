Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability constant (K) tells us how stable that complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable, so the metal ion tends to stay bound to EDTA. 

So the Ca-EDTA complex is our complex ion here. EDTA, I think, is a hexadentate ligand, meaning it can bind to a metal ion at six sites. The formula for the complex would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4−. Wait, but when EDTA is in solution, it exists in different protonated forms, right? The stability constant usually accounts for that, so I probably don't need to worry about that part here because the problem says the pH is ideal. So I can safely assume that EDTA is in its correct form to form the complex without considering the protonation states.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration as [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. The question asks for [Ca²+] in solution.

I think this is a problem where the K is given for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−

The stability constant K is given by:
K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )

But wait, in some cases, the EDTA is in the H4Y form, but since the pH is ideal and we have a K value provided, perhaps the exact form isn't needed. Maybe I can treat the problem as just the formation constant equation.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, and we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

So, assuming that the complex dissociates to a small extent, but given that K is so large (5x10^10), which is a huge number, the complex is very stable. That suggests that the dissociation is minimal, meaning that [Ca²+] will be very low. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really small compared to 0.02 M.

Wait, but let me think again. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. The formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + Y^4− ↔ CaY²−; K = 5e10.

So, the expression is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

But wait, in solution, the concentration of Y^4− (EDTA in the deprotonated form) might not be the same as the total EDTA concentration because EDTA can exist in various protonated forms. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so I think this implies that the solution is such that Y^4− is the dominant species. So maybe I can assume that [Y^4−] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration, but wait, in this case, the CaY²− is the only EDTA species present? Or am I mixing that up.

Wait, no. The solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex, which is formed by Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the total EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA^4− and the complex CaY²−. But wait, in this problem, the initial solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, so all the EDTA is tied up in the complex, right? Or is some of it dissociated?

Wait, no. The CaY²− is the complex, so the total EDTA is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, some of it becomes free Y^4− and free Ca²+.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with an ICE table. Let me set up the dissociation:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−

Initial concentrations:
[CaY²−] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (since before dissociation, no ions)
[Y^4−] = 0

Change:
Let x be the concentration that dissociates. So:

[CaY²−] decreases by x, so becomes 0.02 - x.
[Ca²+] increases by x → x
[Y^4−] increases by x → x

But wait, in reality, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− are not zero. Because the solution might have some free ions, but given that the complex is formed with the given K, perhaps it's better to approach it using the K expression.

Wait, but the K is given for the formation of the complex. So, K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−)}.

But sometimes, the formation constant is written as Kf = [complex]/([metal][ligand]).

So, given Kf = 5e10, and [CaY²−] = 0.02 M.

If the solution is ideal, and dissociation is minimal, then x would be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kf = [CaY²−] / ( [Ca²+][Y^4−} ) ≈ 0.02 / (x * x) ) → 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

So, solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-14.

Wait, wait: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2 /5 ) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no. Let me calculate.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is x, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the K is 5e10. So K = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] )

Assume [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] = x.

So, K = 0.02/(x²) =5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2 → x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 → 0.4 * 1e-12 → 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7, which is about 6.3e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7 M. So option C.

Another way to think: since K is so large, the complex is very stable. So most of the Ca is bound, and the free [Ca²+] is very low, which matches with option C being the smallest concentration. The other options are larger, so they can't be right given the high K value.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the stability constant (K) provided, which is 5 × 10¹⁰. The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca²⁺} + \text{Y⁴⁻}
\]

The stability constant is given by:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY²⁻}]}{[\text{Ca²⁺}][\text{Y⁴⁻}]}
\]

Assuming the pH is ideal, the dissociation is minimal, and the concentrations of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) and free EDTA ([Y⁴⁻]) are equal due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the reaction. Let the concentration of dissociated ions be \(x\). Then:

\[
[\text{CaY²⁻}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca²⁺}] = x, \quad [\text{Y⁴⁻}] = x
\]

Substituting into the expression for \(K\):

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) 2.0 × 10⁻² M**  
**B) 5.0 × 10⁻³ M**  
**C) 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M**  
**D) 1.0 × 10⁻² M**

The correct choice is **C**, as it matches the calculated value.

Answer: C
