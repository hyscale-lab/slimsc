Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A through D, each suggesting a different relationship with r.

Wait, so parallax and distance are inversely related, right? Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That means d = 1/plx. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies with parallax as N = 1 / plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. I need to find how N depends on distance r. Since r is the distance, let's write d instead for clarity. So, substituting d into the equation.

Since plx = 1/d, then plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So, 1/(plx^5) would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, that part is a bit tricky. So maybe it's not just the total number of stars up to a certain distance, but how many stars are there in a thin shell at distance r, or something like that.

Oh right, in astronomy, when you look at a certain volume of space, the number of stars you can see depends on how many are in that volume. If the number density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr would be proportional to the volume of that shell. But wait, the volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r² dr. But that's the usual case.

But in this problem, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So I need to think about how this translates into distance.

Let me go back. N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then plx^5 = (1/d)^5. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, so does that mean that the number of stars increases as d^5? But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps we're looking at the number of stars within a certain distance. Or maybe it's the number per unit distance.

Wait, no, the number of stars in a given volume. But if the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, then for a given volume (which depends on r), the number would be higher if d is larger. But I'm trying to figure out how the number changes per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I should consider differential number of stars. So the number
