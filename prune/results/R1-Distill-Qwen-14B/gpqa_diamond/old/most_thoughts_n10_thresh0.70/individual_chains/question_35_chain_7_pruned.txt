Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator. It's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific matrix. The first row of S is (0 -i), the second row is (i 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, I have to decide which of the four statements (A to D) is correct during that calculation.

Wait, let's start by writing down what Ay looks like. The constant c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So multiplying each element by c, we get:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, the matrix Ay would be:

[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ], [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues a of Ay, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ [-a, (-i h)/(4π) ], [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is [(-a)(-a)] - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (i)(-i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, because when you multiply the off-diagonal terms, it's ( (-i h/4π) )*( (i h/4π) ) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²)

But (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = +1. So the determinant is a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) * (1) ) ].

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

That would give a² = (h²)/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, wait, let me compute (h/(4π)) squared. (h/(4π))² is h²/(16 π²). So sqrt( (h²)/(16 π²) ) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the determinant equation is a² - (h/(4π))² * ( (i)(-i) ) )? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant. The determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - [ ( (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π)
