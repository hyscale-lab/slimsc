Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a reaction where the compound (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene is treated with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, the researcher checks with TLC and sees that the reactant spot has decreased, and two new spots have appeared. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures.

Hmm. I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction, specifically following Markovnikov's rule. But wait, the starting material here is an aryl ether, right? The structure is a benzene ring with an ether linkage (O-) attached to a substituent. The substituent is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Let me draw that out mentally. So, the substituent is a four-carbon chain, with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, but numbering can be tricky. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let's see, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No wait, but but is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to benzene? Wait, no, that's but-1-en-1-yl, maybe. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2C(CH3)CH2-O- with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl
