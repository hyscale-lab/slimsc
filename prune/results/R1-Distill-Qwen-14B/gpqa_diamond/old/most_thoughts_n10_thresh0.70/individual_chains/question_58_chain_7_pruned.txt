Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems because they make the theories predict nonsensical results, like infinities. Regularization helps to make these terms finite so that you can renormalize them. But some theories don't need this because they're already finite or have no such divergences.

Wait, so which theories are safe from needing regularization? I think I remember that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a renormalizable theory. But does it require regularization? Because during calculations, like loop diagrams, you often get divergences. So you do need to regularize, but the theory is renormalizable, meaning you can absorb the infinities into a finite number of parameters.

Wait, but the question is which theory never requires regularization. So maybe it's a theory that doesn't have these divergences in the first place. So which theories are like that?

Classical Electrodynamics is a non-quantum theory. It doesn't have the same kind of infinities because it's not a quantum field theory. So in classical E&M, you don't have divergent integrals or renormalization issues. So you don't need regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory tool.

But wait, the question is about high energies. Hmm. At high energies, quantum effects become important, so why would classical E&M not require regularization? Because in the classical theory, you don't quantize anything. So even at high energies (though in reality, classical E&M breaks down at very high energies and small distances, but that's a different issue), you don't have the same divergences that appear in quantum theories.

So looking at the options, the theory that doesn't require regularization would probably be the classical one.

Wait, let me think about each option:

A) Superstring Theory: I think string theory is a candidate for a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as QFT. Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, and the perturbative expansion is in terms of diagrams that don't lead to the same types of divergences as point particles. Or
