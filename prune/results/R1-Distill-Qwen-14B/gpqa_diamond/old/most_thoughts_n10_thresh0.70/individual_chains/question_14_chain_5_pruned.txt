Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by breaking down the question.

The scenario is that someone did a ChIP-seq experiment on PFA-fixed human B cells using an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor. After doing the usual steps like sequencing, quality control, alignment, and peak-calling, they found some peaks. But when they used PFA plus DSG for fixation instead, those peaks disappeared. The question is asking where these disappearing peaks are most likely located.

Hmm, I remember that in ChIP-seq, the process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA so that the binding sites can be captured. The type of crosslinker used can affect the results. PFA is paraformaldehyde, which I think is a common fixative. But wait, sometimes they use other agents like DSG (disuccinimide) or formaldehyde. Oh, right, DSG is a crosslinker that's usually used before cell lysis to fix proteins to DNA, but maybe it's more efficient or has different crosslinking properties.

Wait, no, PFA is often used for fixation in ChIP because it's less harsh than formaldehyde. But sometimes, especially when dealing with certain cell types or proteins, you might need a stronger crosslinker. DSG is a more specific crosslinker, typically used at lower concentrations and maybe for proteins that are harder to fix.

So the experiment here used PFA fixation alone in the first case, and in the second, they used PFA plus DSG. The peaks found with PFA alone disappeared when using the combination. That suggests that the antibody was able to pull down DNA in the first case but not in the second. So why would that happen?

I remember that some regions of the genome are harder to crosslink. For example, heterochromatin is tightly packed, so crosslinking agents might not penetrate as well. In contrast, euchromatin is more open, so crosslinkers can get in more easily. So regions that are more open might have better crosslinking.

Wait, but the question is about where the peaks disappear. The initial peaks were present with PFA alone but not with PFA+DSG. So perhaps, when using a stronger crosslinker, the binding sites that were only weakly crosslinked with PFA are lost. So the peaks that disappeared were in regions that are harder to crosslink, or maybe regions where the protein isn't really bound but the PFA crosslinking made it seem so.

Alternatively, maybe regions that are more accessible are better fixed with PFA, but with DSG, the fixation is more efficient elsewhere. Or maybe the opposite. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, DSG is a thiol-based crosslinker, isn't it? Oh, no, wait. DSG (disuccinimide) is a homobifunctional crosslinker, often used for crosslinking proteins in vitro. Wait, wait, I think PFA is a formaldehyde-based fixative, which crosslinks proteins to DNA and proteins to proteins. DSG, on the other hand, is a shorter crosslinker with a different chemistry. Oh, but in the context of ChIP, maybe DSG isn't used
