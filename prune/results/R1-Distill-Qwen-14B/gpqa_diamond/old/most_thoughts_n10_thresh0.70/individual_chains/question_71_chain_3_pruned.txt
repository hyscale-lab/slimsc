Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, and they are in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We need to find the temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming the same albedo for all.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. I remember it's something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe a simpler version when comparing planets around the same star.

Oh right! The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to ( (L / (16πσd²) )^(1/4) ), but if all planets are around the same star, then L is the same for all. So, the temperature depends on the distance d from the star. Since L and σ are constants, the temperature ratio between two planets depends on the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances squared? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law.

Wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period if the semi-major axis is proportional to the period. Wait, no, not exactly. Because for circular orbits, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a by Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a is proportional to (P²)^(1/3) = P^(2/3). So a increases with P^(2/3).

But wait, in this problem, the periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So for Planet_2, the period is 2 units, Planet_4 is 3.5 units.

So first, I need to find the ratio of their distances, a4/a2, because that will affect the temperature.

Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a4/a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3).

So P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So 3.5/2 is 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let's compute that. Alternatively, I can compute it as ( (7/4)^(1/3) ) squared. Let's see, the cube root of 7/4.

Cube root of 4 is about 1.587, cube root of 7 is approximately 1.913. So 1.913 / 1.587 ≈ 1.206. So (1.206)^2 is about 1.454. So a4 is about 1.454 times a2.

Wait, wait, no, because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a4
