Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a super fast spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 Earth years. They want to come to Earth, and the astronaut is 22 years old. The question is, how long will the trip take from the astronaut's perspective?

Hmm, right. So I think this has to do with special relativity and time dilation. Because when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of an external observer. But wait, wait, no, actually, the astronaut is the one moving, so they would experience less time passing, meaning their own clock would tick slower compared to someone on Earth.

Wait, wait, I get confused sometimes between the perspectives. So let's clarify. From Earth's frame of reference, the spaceship is moving very fast. So the time it takes for the spaceship to reach Earth would be much longer from Earth's point of view, but from the astronaut's point of view, the trip would seem shorter because of length contraction.

Wait, no, no. Wait, actually, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is shorter than the time experienced by someone on Earth because of time dilation. So the spaceship's crew would age less than the people they left behind on Earth.

Wait, but the problem is asking how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective. So we're looking for the proper time, which is less than the Earth time.

But wait, how much time passes on Earth for the trip? Let me think. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is roughly about 160,000 light-years, I think. Wait, but wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 170,000 light-years away from Earth, approximately. Let me check my numbers, but maybe I don't need the exact distance because the problem might expect me to use a certain approach.

Wait, but maybe I should proceed with the given speed and figure out the time. So, the speed is 0.99999987c. So the time from Earth's perspective (t) would be the distance divided by
