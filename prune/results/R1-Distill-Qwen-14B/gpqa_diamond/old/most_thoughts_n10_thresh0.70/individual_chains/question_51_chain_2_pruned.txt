Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy involving a charge near a conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says: A charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy... Right, potential energy in electrostatics is usually calculated by considering the work done to bring charges together. But in this case, there's a conducting sphere involved, which might complicate things.

So, the sphere is conducting and grounded. That means any excess charge on it will reside on the surface, and the sphere being grounded ensures that its potential is zero. Oh wait, no, maybe I should think about what that implies. If it's grounded, it can conduct charges to or from the earth, so the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as Earth's potential, which is usually considered zero.

But wait, the charge q is placed near the sphere. When a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges would flow to the ground? Or wait, induced charges. Let's think: if I place a positive charge q near the conductor, the free electrons in the conductor would be attracted towards the near side, leaving the far side positively polarized. But since the sphere is grounded, those electrons can flow into the earth, right? So the sphere might actually remain neutral in terms of overall charge because any induced charges can leave or enter via the ground. Or wait, noâ€”maybe the sphere can't have any net charge because it's grounded. So the induced charges would exactly cancel any effect, but wait, no, the sphere was initially neutral, right?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The conducting sphere is grounded, so any excess charge on it can leave to the ground. But when I place a charge q near it, charges in the conductor redistribute. But because the sphere is grounded, the induced charges are neutralized. So the sphere remains neutral overall? Or does it induce a dipole or something?

Wait, no. When I bring a charge q near a conductor, it polarizes the conductor. The conductor's free electrons move towards the charge if it's positive, creating a negative charge on the near side and positive on the far. But since the sphere is conducting, the
