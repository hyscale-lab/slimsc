Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. In the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so maybe things are a bit different.

The setup says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx², right? But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, what's the total energy here? In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all energy is potential. Then as it moves, potential converts into kinetic. But when it's moving the fastest, all the potential is converted to kinetic. But relativistically, I'm not so sure.

Wait, no, because in the relativistic case, energy conservation should still hold. The total energy when the oscillator is at x=0 (maximum speed) should be the sum of its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, the potential energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator might not be the same as the non-relativistic case. Hmm. Or maybe the question is assuming that the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, the problem says "obeying Hooke's
