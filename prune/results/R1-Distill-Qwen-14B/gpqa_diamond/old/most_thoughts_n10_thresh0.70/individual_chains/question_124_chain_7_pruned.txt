Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles colliding in a detector. Let me try to break this down. Hmm, the question is about Lorentz factors and how they affect the particles reaching the detector walls. 

Alright, the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new type, travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, and have a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls. 

Wait, so the initial situation is that with a Lorentz factor of 20, only about 1/3 reach the walls. And we need to find the factor that would make it 2/3. 

I remember that the Lorentz factor (gamma) is related to time dilation and length contraction. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime. 

So the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame measures the lifetime as gamma times tau. 

The particles decay after a certain time, and whether they reach the detector walls depends on how far they travel before decaying. Because the detector is a sphere with radius 30 meters, the particles have to travel 30 meters or less for us to detect them. 

Wait, but wait. The particles are produced at the center of the sphere, so they have to travel 30 meters to reach the inner walls. If their lifetime is such that they can't reach that distance, they'll decay before hitting the walls. 

So the key is determining the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance the particles can travel before decaying. 

The distance should be equal to the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So distance D = v * t. 

But since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their velocity v is approximately the speed of light, c. So D â‰ˆ c * gamma * tau. 

Wait, wait, let me get that right. The lifetime measured in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the time available for the particle to travel is t = gamma * tau. 

The distance D is then v * t. But v is approximately c for ultra-rel
