Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the Bragg's Law formula or maybe something related to the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices. Wait, I think it's the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Let me think. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) in a crystal is given by 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) [1/(1 - cos²α) for some terms, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, right, in a cubic system, it's simpler, but this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal or maybe a non-cubic system. Oh wait, rhombohedral is a special case where all edges are equal (a=b=c) but the angles are not 90 degrees. So it's like a distorted cubic system.

The formula I remember for interplanar distance in such a crystal is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * [1/(1 - cos²α) ] and maybe some other terms involving the angles. Or maybe it's more complicated. Wait, another approach: for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα ), but I'm not sure if that's right. Alternatively, I think there's a formula involving the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the general formula. The interplanar distance in a crystal is given by d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²) ) + (k²/(b²) ) + (l²/(c²)) - 2 hk cosβγ/(a b) - 2 hl cosαγ/(a c) - 2 kl cosαβ/(b c) ) ), but that's for a general triclin
