Okay, so I've got this question about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells and their expression in a mouse model. The question is a bit detailed, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector, right? So the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Both are under certain promoters and have stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, often used for expression in various tissues. The receptor is after an IRES element. Oh, IRES is Internal Ribosome Entry Site, which allows for translation of the second gene in bicistronic constructs without needing a second promoter. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, then the IRES drives the receptor expression.

But then there are stop cassettes. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP between it and mCherry. The receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. Hmm. Oh, right, these are for Cre-mediated recombination. LoxP and lox2272 are different sites recognized by Cre. So if Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream reporter (mCherry or eGFP) to be expressed.

Wait, but the setup says the ligand is at 5' with mCherry, and the receptor at 3' with eGFP. So the vector is set up as: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP stop loxP -> mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF -> lox2272 stop lox2272 -> eGFP.

So in normal conditions, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed because the CBA promoter drives it, but the stop cassette after ligand would prevent mCherry from being expressed. The IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed, but the stop cassette before eGFP would prevent it from being expressed either.

But when Cre is introduced, it would recombine the lox sites. So, in the ligand's case, Cre would excise the loxP-stop-loxP, allowing the mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, Cre would excise the lox2272-stop-lox2272, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, and they're using different lox sites. So perhaps each gene's expression is controlled by which lox site is used. So the ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed only if the Cre can
