Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about observations of a quasar's spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical range. But the flux drops significantly below that wavelength, meaning at shorter wavelengths. I remember that quasars often have emission lines, and when we observe them, the wavelengths can be stretched due to the expansion of the universe. This is redshift, right?

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. I think that's in the near infrared. For optical, visible light is about 400-700 nm. So 790 is infrared, which might mean a redshifted emission line. What's a common emission line in quasars? Hydrogen lines like the Lyman alpha (121 nm rest wavelength) or maybe the Balmer series like H-alpha (656 nm rest). Wait, but if the peak is at 790, that could mean the emission line is redshifted from something shorter. Let me think: 790 nm. Let's see, if the rest wavelength is shorter, like 656 nm for H-alpha, then the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. So (790-656)/656 = 134/656 ≈ 0.204. So z≈0.2.

Alternatively, another line. Oh, Lyman alpha is 121 nm. 790 would be z=(790-121)/121 ≈ 669/121≈5.53. That's a high redshift. Wait, but if the observed peak is in the near-infrared, could it be Lyman alpha emitted but then shifted into infrared? Because Lyman alpha is in UV, so if the source is at high redshift, the UV emission would be shifted into optical or IR for us.

Wait but the flux drops below 790 nm. So at wavelengths shorter than 790, the flux drops. That makes me think that 790 is the peak, and perhaps the drop-off is due to the
