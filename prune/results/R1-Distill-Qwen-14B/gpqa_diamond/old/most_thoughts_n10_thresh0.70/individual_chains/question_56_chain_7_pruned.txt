Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the correct transition route and the probability.

Wait, I remember that in hydrogen atoms, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, right? And these transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions specifically have certain selection rules.

The standard selection rules for dipole transitions in hydrogen are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1 up or down, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0.

But wait, so the initial state is l=0. To go to l=1, because l has to change by ±1 for a dipole transition. Because if l=0, the next possible l is 1. So from |3,0,0⟩, the first transition must go to a state with l=1. So that would be n=2, l=1, because 2 <3 and 1 is l=1. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the electron can emit a photon and go to a lower energy level. So from n=3, it can go to n=2 or n=1. But since the final state is n=1, it can't go directly because that would require two steps. Oh wait, the question says via two dipole transitions. So it has to go through an intermediate state.

So first transition: from |3,0,0⟩ to some state with l=1. The possible states are n=2, l=1, m= -1, 0, +1. Because m can change by 0, ±1.

Then from that intermediate state, another dipole transition to |1,0,0⟩. So the second transition must bring l from 1 to 0 (since the final state has l=0). That fits the selection rule (Δl= ±1). So the intermediate state must have l=1, and the final state has l=0.

So
