Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It gives two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It says one of these doesn't show tautomerism, which is part A of the question. Then, part B is about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, and which one shows optical isomerism.

Hmm, I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in bonding, like in enols and ketones. So, tautomerism requires certain structural features, such as adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups or the possibility of forming a double bond.

Let's tackle part A first. We have benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups, right? It's like benzene with two oxygen atoms in a ring, each connected to a carbonyl group.

Wait, benzoquinone can have two forms: para and ortho. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone is a di-quinone structure, meaning it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other, para positions. So the structure is like O=C6H4=O. So, does this compound have any possibility for tautomerism?

Tautomerism occurs when there's a hydrogen that can shift between adjacent atoms, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, the molecule should have adjacent carbonyl groups and hydrogens that can move. Wait, but benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on adjacent carbons? No, wait, in para positions, the carbonyls are at opposite ends. Wait, the positions are 1 and 4 in benzene (since it's para). So they're not adjacent. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. So each carbonyl is at opposite positions. So between them, there are two CH groups. So each carbonyl is on a carbon that's separated by a couple of carbons from the other. So for tautomerism, you usually need a hydrogen adjacent to a
