Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question involves selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I remember that reagents play a big role in determining the type of reaction that occurs.

First, let's look at the reactions given.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, what usually happens? Oh wait, I think that's a nucleophilic addition. In a ketone, the carbonyl group is a good electrophile. So NaCN would provide the cyanide ion as a nucleophile. But wait, under what conditions does that happen?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that for the addition of HCN to ketones, you usually need an acid catalyst. Like H3O+ maybe? So in the presence of an acid, the carbonyl oxygen becomes protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack the carbonyl carbon.

But wait, in this case, it's NaCN. Oh wait, wait a second. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition where the ketone reacts with cyanide in acidic conditions.

So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would add to the carbonyl, so the product would have a cyanide group attached. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, how does that happen?

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a substitution. But ketones don't typically undergo substitution as easily as, say, alkyl halides. So more likely, it's an addition. Oh, right, the addition of HCN to ketones. The ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the hydroxyl and nitrile groups are added across the carbonyl group.

So the general reaction is ket
