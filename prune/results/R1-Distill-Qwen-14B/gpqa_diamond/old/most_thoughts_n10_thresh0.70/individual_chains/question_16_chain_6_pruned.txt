Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in various organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which requires the presence of a chiral center. Oh wait, or maybe some other forms of asymmetry like a planar chirality? But I think for these questions, we just need to look for chiral centers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is chloro on C1, double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)=? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-, but with a double bond. Wait, no: wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No wait, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's butane. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, no, but the double bond is but-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that's butane, not butene. Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So CH2Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that would be 2-methyl. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2? So the actual structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would make it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to the first carbon of a double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the geometry.

Wait, the molecule is (Z)-configured. So, regardless, does it have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure: the first carbon is Cl, the second is CH2, but wait, no. Wait, wait: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace a H on C1 with Cl. So Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, but that can
