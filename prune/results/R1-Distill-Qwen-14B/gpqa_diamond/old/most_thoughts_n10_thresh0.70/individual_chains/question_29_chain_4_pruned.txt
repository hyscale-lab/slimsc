Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at mutations in the target gene. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. So the idea is that by mutating the gene, perhaps the protein it produces won't function. If the gene is nonfunctional, the anti-nutrient compound won't be made, making the cultivar usable for food.

The intact gene sequence is provided, and then there are four mutants. I need to look at each mutant's sequence and see which mutation is most likely to disrupt the gene's function.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing the first part. Let me line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA C...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC T... Wait, maybe I should look more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I should find where the changes are. Let me compare each position.

Looking at each nucleotide:

Intact: 5' ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3'

Mutant1: 5' ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA-3'

So, looking at the beginning. Let's break it into parts. The first part of the intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

In Mutant1, it's ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC T... Wait, maybe I should count the nucleotides.

Let me count the letters:

Intact: positions 1-10: ATG TTT CTC GCT (maybe the next letters)

Wait, perhaps a better approach: look for where the sequences differ.

Looking at each mutant's sequence, perhaps the first 20 or so nucleotides, since the question says the changes are in the first exon area.

So for Mutant 1:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 

Wait, maybe the first part is:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG G
