Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Alright, so there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a super-fast spaceship that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. The question is, how long will the trip take from the astronaut's perspective?

Wait, the options are about whether he dies before reaching Earth or how old he is when he arrives. So I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut during the journey.

I remember that when traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time for the traveler (proper time) is less than the time measured by someone at rest relative to the destination. So from Earth's frame, the trip would take a certain amount of time, but the astronaut would age less.

Wait, but the question is from the astronaut's point of view. So I think I should use the time dilation formula from special relativity. Time dilation formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where τ is the proper time experienced by the astronaut, and t is the time measured in Earth's frame.

Wait, no, actually, from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving. So the distance is
