Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is involved. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of the substituents on a double bond are swapped. So, it typically breaks and reforms double bonds by swapping the ends.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But since it's the same molecule, maybe the racemic part doesn't affect the outcome much because each enantiomer would undergo the same reactions.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. The formula is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on the double bond are a CH2 group (from C1) and a C(CH3)CH2CH3 group (from C2). Wait, no: 3-methylpent-1-ene structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, wait, maybe I should number it correctly.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's 1-pentene. But here, it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, which would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's correct. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are: on C1, a CH2 group (actually, C1 is CH2, but wait, no: the structure is CH2=CH-... Right, so C1 is CH2, and C2 is CH connected to a C(CH3) group. Wait, let me clarify.

The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? No,
