Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the RHIC when a Li nucleus (with 3 neutrons) is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, first, I need to understand the problem step by step.

Wait, Li with 3 neutrons. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. The standard isotope is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Wait, but the question says 3 neutrons. Oh, so maybe it's Li-6, which has 3 neutrons (since 6 Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons). So, the nucleus in question is Li-6.

Right, so the mass number A is 6. So, the mass of the nucleus is important here. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are slightly heavier, around 939.565 MeV/c² or something like that.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh wait, but in particle physics, when dealing with high energies, perhaps we should use the rest mass of the nucleus, which includes binding energy. Alternatively, maybe we can approximate it using the sum of the individual nucleon masses but that might not be accurate. Hmm, but without exact data, perhaps we can proceed with an approximate value.

Alternatively, maybe the mass is given or I can look it up. Oh, wait, in a typical problem like this, perhaps the mass is taken as roughly the sum of the masses of the nucleons. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can calculate the rest energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the mass would be approximately 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron mass). But wait, each proton is about 1.007276 u, and neutron is about 1.008665 u. Oh wait, but converting to MeV/c², 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c².

Wait, perhaps
