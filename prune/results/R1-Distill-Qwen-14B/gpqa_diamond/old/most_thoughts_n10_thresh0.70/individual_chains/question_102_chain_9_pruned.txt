Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The experiment involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two coding regions under a single promoter, right? So the vector has the ligand ORF first, then the receptor.

The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein. The vector setup: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. So, I think that means the ligand is under a promoter, then the stop cassette, then the receptor, which has an IRES element upstream.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so that's for the ligand. The receptor is after an IRES, which allows internal ribosome entry, so maybe it's expressed in a different way. The constructs have loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. Oh right, loxP is recognized by Cre and allows for recombination. So the stop cassettes would prevent expression unless Cre is present to cut them.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested with Western blot. They transfected primary astrocytes. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which probably means the proteins are being expressed, but perhaps not correctly.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. Cre is expressed under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells, I think. So the Cre would recombine the lox sites.

The offspring were born, and they looked under confocal for green signals. They didn't see any. So eGFP isn't being expressed, or the receptor isn't expressed either. Or perhaps the eGFP is not being properly tagged.

The question is why there's no green signal. The options are A to D. Let's think through each.

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this setup, the vector is in the same cell, so both ligand and receptor should be expressed in the same cells. If they were paracrine, maybe the ligand acts on neighboring cells, but why would that affect the eGFP expression? Not sure, but maybe not the main issue here.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The eGFP is on the C-terminus of the receptor. If the receptor is stuck in the Golgi, then it wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface. So you wouldn't see the green fluorescence. But why would that happen? Maybe due to a stop codon or incorrect frame. Or perhaps the eGFP is not properly tagged.

Option C: enhancer missing for ligand and receptor. The enhancers are usually required for tissue-specific expression. But in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is probably under the IRES, which might allow it to be expressed without a promoter? Or maybe the IRES isn't sufficient. Wait, IRES elements usually allow for expression without a promoter, but they are often cell-type specific. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor might not be expressed. But then, why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the vector includes both, and the Cre would excise the stops.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector. So the first gene is ligand with mCherry and the second is receptor with eGFP. The stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. So without Cre, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, so only ligand and mCherry would be expressed. The receptor's ORF is behind the IRES and a lox2272 stop. When Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP and lox2272, removing the stop cassettes, allowing both ORFs to be expressed.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The construct has, from 5' to 3':

Ligand ORF -- loxP -- stop cassette -- IRES -- receptor ORF -- lox2272 --
