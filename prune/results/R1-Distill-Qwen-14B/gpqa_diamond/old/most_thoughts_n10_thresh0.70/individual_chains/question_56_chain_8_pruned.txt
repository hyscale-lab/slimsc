Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, the question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, right, the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the electric dipole selection rules state that for a transition to be allowed, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l must be ±1. Oh yeah, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. But wait, for the principal quantum number n, it can change by any integer, but in this case, since it's a two-step decay from 3 to 1, each transition must be a single step of n changing by 1 or 2? No, wait, each transition is a single photon emission, so each step must change n by 1. Because you can't have a transition that skips a level in a single photon emission, right? So from 3 to 2 in the first step, and then 2 to 1 in the second step.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. The decays are via two dipole transitions.

Which intermediate states are allowed? Let's think. The first transition from n=3, l=0. Since l must change by ±1, so l can go to l=1 in the first step. Then, from l=1, the next step must go to l=0 or l=2, but since the final state is l=0, the second step must go from l=1 to l=0.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. Because when you have l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the first transition from |3,0,0> must go to a state with l=1. So the possible states are |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, or |2,1,-1>. Then, each of those would decay further.

Wait, but wait. The second transition must go from n=2 to n=1. So the second state must have l=0, because the final state is |1,0,0>. So from l=1, the second transition must change l by ±1, so l=0. So the intermediate state must have l=1, and the next step must have l=0. So the intermediate state must be |2,1,m>, and then transition to |1,0,0>.

Wait, but in the first transition, from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, m can be 0, ±1. Then the second transition must go from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

But the question says it's a two-step decay via two dipole transitions. So the options are about possible routes. Let's look at the options.

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option D: Hmm, the first part seems incomplete. It says |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and probability 2/3.

Wait, which of these are possible? All of them are possible, because any change in m by 0, ±1 is allowed. But the probabilities come into play because of the transition dipole moment or the selection rules. The allowed transitions have non-zero dipole matrix elements.

Wait, the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element for the dipole transition. The transition is allowed only if the matrix element is non-zero.

The matrix element for electric dipole transition is proportional to <f|
