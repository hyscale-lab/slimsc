Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, let's understand what the question is asking. We have two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds because of the way velocities add in special relativity. Oh right, the velocity addition formula. I remember that the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down.

So for the relative speed, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. So if both are moving in the same direction, what's their relative speed?

Oh right, if you're in a frame where one is moving at v1 and the other at v2, then the relative speed is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c^2)). Wait wait, wait, no. Let me get this straight. When you're moving along with one object, say, the first astronaut (A) moving at 0.6c, then what's the speed of the second astronaut (B) moving at 0.5c in the same direction from A's frame?

Wait, I think I got that wrong. Because from the rest frame, A is at 0.6c and B is at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, let me think. The velocity addition formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case, from A's frame, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²
