Okay, so I have this physics problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The well has length L, and the energy E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy levels are quantized, right?

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they have spin up or down. But since they're identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold only a certain number of particles—specifically, two per each distinct quantum state because of spin.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are E_n = (n²)E, where n is the principal quantum number. For four particles, I need to figure out how they fill up the energy levels considering the Pauli principle.

The ground state would be the lowest possible configuration. Since each energy level can hold two particles (spin up and down), let's see: the first level (n=1) can have 2 particles, the second (n=2) another 2. So with four particles, n=1 and n=2 are filled. The total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no: each particle in the same n but different spins. So for four particles, each n holds two. So n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles. So the total is 2*(1²E + 2²E) = 2*(1 +4)E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E?

No, wait no. Wait, actually, each level n can have two particles. So for four particles, two must be in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is (2)*(1²E) + (2)*(2²E) → 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state is 10E. But wait, looking at the options, option B and C have 10E as a possible ground
