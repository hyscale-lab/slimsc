Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a matrix with the first row (0 -i) and the second row (i 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and then see which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, so S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write S down:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

Then A_y is c multiplied by S. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

Eigenvalues of A_y are the solutions to the equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

So the matrix A_y - λ I would be:

[( (h/(4π)) * 0 - λ )   ( (h/(4π)) * (-i) ) ]
[ ( (h/(4π)) * i )      ( (h/(4π)) * 0 - λ ) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ -λ           (-i h/(4π) ) ]
[ i h/(4π)      -λ          ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating that determinant: λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) )(h/(4π))² ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i², which is -( -1 ), so 1. So the determinant becomes λ² - [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ] = 0.

So the equation is λ² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The determinant calculation: (upper left * lower right) minus (upper right * lower left). So:

(-λ)(-λ) = λ².
(-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h^2)/(16 π²) )

(-i * i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) =0, so λ = ± h/(4π) * sqrt(1) ?

Wait, wait, because h/(4π) squared is h²/(16 π²). So yeah, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, options A and B have different eigenvalues.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). But our eigenvalues are real
