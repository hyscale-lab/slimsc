Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about scattering amplitudes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And they tell me to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, scattering amplitude... right. The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is a complex function. I remember that in the context of partial waves, the scattering amplitude can be expressed using the phase shifts. The formula I vaguely recall is something like f(θ, φ) = (1/(2i)) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / sinδ_l ) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} ), but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, more accurately, the scattering amplitude is given by the sum over l of ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} ) times the spherical harmonics or something. Or perhaps it's better to think in terms of the partial wave expansion. Oh right, the general form is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}, where k is the wave number. But wait, sometimes the exact expression varies based on the source.

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That probably means θ=0°, since the beam is along the initial direction, and maybe φ=0 as well? Or perhaps just the direction of the beam, which is the forward direction.

Wait, when the scattering angle θ is zero, the direction is along the beam, so the point is f(0,0). Hmm, but I'm not sure about the φ part because the problem might assume it's the direction along the beam, so φ=0. Or maybe the question is only concerned with the magnitude, like the real or imaginary part without considering the phase.

Wait, but the question says "along the incident beam direction," so
