Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay and resolution in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They ask what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The setup is in the CERN Bubble Chamber with an energy of 27 GeV and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime they experience depends on their speed relative to the observer. So the lifetime we measure (the dilated one) is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor gamma, which is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to gamma = E/(m c²), I think. Since E is given as 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV, so E/(m) would be 27/3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41 is approximately, let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28. Oh wait, 27 is just a little less than 27.28. So 7.9 approximately. So gamma is roughly 7.9.

Wait, but wait, E is the total energy, right? And m is the rest mass. So yes, gamma is E/(m c²). But since the units are in GeV, and c is a big number, but in particle physics, they often use units where c=1, so E (in GeV) would be E = gamma m c², but with c=1, E=gamma m. So in this case, gamma is E/(m) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.92.

So gamma is about 7.92.

Now, the lifetime observed is gamma times the proper lifetime. So tau = gamma * tau0. So tau is 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that.

7.92 times 8 is about 63.36, so 63.36e-16 seconds. That's 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh right, the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products' direction, I think. Or perhaps it's the minimum distance over which the decay can be observed.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the decay length. Decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So the formula for decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau0. Because the particle is moving at speed v = beta c.

Wait, but I don't have beta. Let me think, beta is v/c, and beta is related to gamma via gamma = 1/s
