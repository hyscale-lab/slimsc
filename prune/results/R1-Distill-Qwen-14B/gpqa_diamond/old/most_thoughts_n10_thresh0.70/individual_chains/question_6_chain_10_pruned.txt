Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The question is asking for the energy spectrum. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, that looks like a combination of terms involving r squared and cos squared theta. I remember that in polar coordinates, potentials can sometimes be separable, which would help in solving the Schrödinger equation.

So, first, maybe I should rewrite the potential to see if it can be expressed as a sum of functions that depend only on r and theta separately. Let's see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh, wait, I can factor out kr²: V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, that might not directly separate, but perhaps if I think about the effective potential or transform into a different coordinate system.

Wait, another approach: maybe this potential is separable. Let me think. If I can write V(r,θ) as a sum of functions each depending on only r or only θ, then the solution might be easier. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor kr² out, getting kr² (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ). Hmm, but that still depends on both r and θ. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a sum of terms that are functions of r and functions of theta.

Wait, another thought: perhaps this potential can be written in terms of the angular part and radial part. Alternatively, maybe it's a type of oscillator potential. Oh, wait! Because the potential has a term proportional to r², which is like a harmonic oscillator. The additional term involving cos²θ might complicate things, but perhaps it can be transformed into an angular harmonic oscillator or something.

Wait, I remember that in polar coordinates, the Schrödinger equation for a central potential (which depends only on r) is separable. But here, the potential depends on θ as well, so it's not central. So I can't directly use the central potential solution methods. Hmm, but maybe I can do
