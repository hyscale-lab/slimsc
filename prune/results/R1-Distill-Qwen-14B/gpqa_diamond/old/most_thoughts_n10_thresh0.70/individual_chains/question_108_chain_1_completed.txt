Okay, so I've got this physics problem about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. Oh right, Oz is the z-axis, I think. And m is small, so that probably means the orbital magnetic quantum number isn't too big. Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. So if m is small, maybe it's close to zero? Or perhaps just that the magnitude isn't large, so l isn't too big either.

The problem is asking to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy shift due to the magnetic interaction, with the transition energy ΔE. The transition energy is given with a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, wait, that's the wavelength of the Balmer series for hydrogen, right? Like the Balmer-alpha line or something, which corresponds to the transition from n=3 to n=2. So that would be the energy difference ΔE between those two states.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The actual value for the transition might be something else, but let me think. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. For n=3, it's -13.6/9 ≈ -1.51 eV. So ΔE would be the difference between these two, which is 3.4 -1.51 = approx 1.89 eV? Or wait, no. Because ΔE is E_final - E_initial. If the electron transitions from n=3 to n=2, ΔE would be E2 - E3. Since E3 is more negative than E2, the transition energy would be E2 - E3 = (−3.4) − (−1.51) = −1.89 eV. But since we're talking about the magnitude of energy, it's about 1.89 eV. So approximately 1.9 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. I think the paramagnetic term comes into play in the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. But wait, the problem says it's the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic materials have electrons that contribute to their magnetic properties, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the same as the Zeeman effect here. Alternatively, the paramagnetic term might be part of the Hamiltonian when you consider the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field.

The paramagnetic coupling term is probably the perturbation energy due to the magnetic field. So the Hamiltonian for this interaction is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m * some direction, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Wait, maybe more accurately, the magnetic moment is μ = -g (e/(2m_e)) l, or something like that. Wait, no, I'm mixing up orbital and spin contributions. But in this problem, since the magnetic field is applied and it's a paramagnetic effect, perhaps we're talking about the orbital contribution.

Wait, paramagnetic materials have unpaired electrons, so maybe their magnetic moment arises from the spin. But in the hydrogen atom, the electron has spin 1/2, so the spin magnetic moment is significant. But the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term, so perhaps it refers to the spin-orbit interaction? Or maybe it's the Zeeman effect, which includes the splitting due to the external magnetic field. 

Wait, the question says the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic shift usually refers to the shift in energy levels due to an external magnetic field, which is the Zeeman effect. So the paramagnetic coupling term would be the energy shift caused by the external B field.

So the energy shift ΔE_mag is given by the Zeeman formula. For the orbital contribution, the energy is ΔE_orbital = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Alternatively, the formula might be ΔE = m * B * something, but I need to get the exact expression.

Wait, the Zeeman effect splits the energy levels into m levels, each with a shift proportional to m. The energy shift is given by E = γ * m * B, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For electrons, γ is (e/(2m_e)) * g, and g for orbital is 1, but for spin it's about 2. But I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m_l, and the corresponding energy shift is ΔE = m_l * μ_B * B, where μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) * something? Let me get the exact expression.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274×10^-24 J/T. So if the magnetic field is B = 1 T, and m is small, say m=0, but wait, if m is zero, the shift is zero. But m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, but in the problem statement, m is small. So perhaps m is around 0, so the energy shift would be small.

Wait, no, because even a small m would give a non-zero shift. But let's compute the magnitude.

So the paramagnetic (Zeeman) energy shift is ΔE_mag = m * μ_B * B.

Wait, but wait. The Zeeman effect is E = m * μ_B * B. But I'm not entirely sure if it's m or another term. Alternatively, the energy shift is proportional to m, the magnetic quantum number.

So let's compute this. Let's take m as, say, 1 (since it's small, maybe the maximum value for a certain l). But wait, if m is small, perhaps m=1 or m=0, but if m=0, the shift is zero, which won't help. So maybe m=1.

Wait, but the problem says m is small, which could mean that l is small, so m is up to 1 or 2. Let's take m=1, which is the maximum for l=1 (p orbital). So with m=1, B=1 T, μ_B ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T.

So ΔE_mag = 1 * (9.27e-24 J/T) * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J.

Now, let's convert this to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE_mag = 9.27e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

Wait, about 5.8e-5 eV. Now, the transition energy ΔE is about 1.89 eV, as calculated earlier.

So comparing the two, ΔE_mag is about 5.8e-5 eV, and ΔE is about 1.89 eV. So ΔE_mag is much smaller than ΔE. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait. Did I get the energy shift right? Because in the Zeeman effect, for each m, the shift is proportional to m. But for the hydrogen atom, the splitting is much smaller than the fine structure, which is about 0.3 eV. Wait, no, the fine structure is about 0.3 eV, but the Balmer transition is about 1.89 eV, which is much larger than the Zeeman shift. So the paramagnetic term is like 1e-4 eV, which is way smaller than 1 eV.

Wait, but wait again. I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T, correct. B is 1 T, so 9.27e-24 J. To convert to eV, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 9.27e-24 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 5.8e-5 eV. So yeah, that's correct.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much smaller than 1.89 eV. So the question is asking whether the expectation value <H> (which is the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE, or something else.

Wait, the options are: A) <H> = ΔE, B) <H> much greater, C) <<, D) >.

So if <H> is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much less than 1.89 eV, then the correct answer would be C) <H> << ΔE.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the transition energy is the energy of the photon emitted, which is the energy difference between the two states. The paramagnetic term is the shift in a particular state. So when you apply a magnetic field, each energy level is split into m components, each shifted by ΔE_mag = m μ_B B. So for each m, the energy is shifted by that amount. So if the original transition is ΔE, and each state is shifted by a small amount, then the overall energy difference between the split levels would be on the order of ΔE_mag.

But the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which is ΔE_mag) to the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom.

So in terms of magnitude, since ΔE_mag is about 5.8e-5 eV and ΔE is about 1.89 eV, the paramagnetic term is way smaller.

Thus, the correct answer is C) <H> << ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given data:

1. **Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \))**:  
   The wavelength of the transition is \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu \text{m} \), which corresponds to the Balmer series transition from \( n=3 \) to \( n=2 \) in hydrogen. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by \( E_n = -13.6 \, \text{eV} / n^2 \).  
   - \( E_2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 \, \text{eV} \)  
   - \( E_3 = -13.6 / 9 \approx -1.51 \, \text{eV} \)  
   - \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_3 = -3.4 - (-1.51) = -1.89 \, \text{eV} \) (magnitude: \( 1.89 \, \text{eV} \)).

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\( \langle H \rangle \))**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{mag}} = m \mu_B B
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number.  
   - Assuming \( m = 1 \) (a small value), the shift is:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{mag}} = 1 \cdot (9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}) \cdot 1 \, \text{T} = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
     \]  
   - Converting to eV:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{mag}} = \frac{9.27 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
     \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term \( \Delta E_{\text{mag}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 1.89 \, \text{eV} \). Thus, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).
