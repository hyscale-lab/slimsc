Alright, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out which of Maxwell's equations would be different in such a scenario.

Let me start by recalling what Maxwell's equations are in our universe. There are four main equations, right? They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. 

The first equation is Gauss's Law for electric fields: it states that the divergence of E is proportional to the charge density. So, ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. That's about electric fields and charge distribution.

The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0. This is the one that says there are no isolated magnetic monopoles. So in our universe, you can't have a magnet with just a single North or South pole; they come in pairs. That must be the key part of the question. Because the question is about a universe where you can have isolated poles, this equation must change.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This deals with the curl of the electric field and changing magnetic fields. I don't think this would be affected by the presence of isolated magnetic poles because it's about how changing B fields induce E fields.

The fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t ). This one relates the curl of the magnetic field to current and changing electric fields. I'm not sure if this would change because it's more about how currents and fields generate B fields.

So, in our universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism (∇·B = 0) is what enforces the absence of magnetic monopoles. If in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that equation must have a non-zero divergence. So, that equation definitely changes.

But wait, the question is which equations are different. Let me look at the options.

Option A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's the second equation. That's right, but wait the options are about which equations are different. Wait, are any others different?

In standard Maxwell's equations, the other equations don't involve magnetic monopoles. So, if the universe allows magnetic monopoles, then the equation for the divergence of B would change. But are there any other equations affected?

Wait, in the presence of magnetic charge, the other equations might change as well. Let me think. If there are magnetic monopoles, you have magnetic charge density, say ρ_m, and magnetic current density J_m. Then, the equations would need to be modified.

In our universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism is ∇·B = 0. If there are monopoles, it would become ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, similar to how Gauss's Law for E involves charge density.

Also, Faraday's Law might get an additional term. Wait, in our universe, Faraday's Law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps there's another term. Alternatively, Ampère's Law might get an additional term for magnetic current. Hmm.

Wait, no,
