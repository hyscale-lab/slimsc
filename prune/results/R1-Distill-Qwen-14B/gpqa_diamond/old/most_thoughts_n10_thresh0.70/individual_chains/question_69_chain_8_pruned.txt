Alright, let's try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, okay, so the question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime is given as τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, so this involves particle physics and decay probabilities. I remember that the number of particles that decay in a certain time depends on their lifetime and the speed at which they're moving. Oh right, the formula for the probability of decay is N = N₀ * (1 - e^(-t/τ)), where τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, actually, I think τ is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor gamma. Because particles moving at high speeds experience time dilation.

So, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is τ_lab = γ * τ₀. And gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is gamma = E / (m c²), but wait, actually, the energy E is equal to gamma m c². So gamma would be E / (m c²). But since we're working in units where c is 1, gamma is just E / m. 

Wait, let me check the units. The mass is given in GeV, and the energy is also GeV. So E = 27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918. So gamma is approximately 7.918.

So the mean lifetime in lab frame is τ_lab = gamma * tau_0. Let me compute that. tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So gamma is around 7.918, so τ_lab = 7.918 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.334e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does this relate to the resolution? The resolution is the minimum distance that can be distinguished in the detector. I think the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the
