Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right?

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of R and S configurations, but wait, actually wait, wait. No, racemic refers to a compound that has chiral centers and is a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene â€“ let me draw the structure.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene is five carbons with the double bond starting at carbon 1. So, structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? Hmm, but where is the substituent, the methyl?

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, pent has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are on C3. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, because it's pent-1-ene, so positions 1 and 2 are the double bond. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, right? So, if it's 3-methyl, then on the third carbon, which is the next one after the double bond. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, because pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the third carbon is the one after the double bond. So adding a methyl there would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would make the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let's count the carbons. Carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH3. So yes, that's correct. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, but that would actually be 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, no, because when you number from the double bond, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, is there a possibility that the structure might be different?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of 3-methylpent-1-ene as being CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I
