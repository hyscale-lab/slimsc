Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it.

Alright, the problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix given as:
First row: 0   -i
Second row: i   0

So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are multiple-choice, so I need to figure out which statements are correct during the calculation.

Wait, eigenvalues... right. For a matrix operator, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and a is the eigenvalue.

Let me write down Ay first. Since Ay = c*S, and c is h/(4π), so Ay is:

[ c*(0)      c*(-i) ]
[ c*(i)      c*(0) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0       -i * c ]
[ i * c    0 ]

Substituting c = h/(4π), so:

[ 0        (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Hmm, but wait, when finding eigenvalues, I can factor out constants. Oh, since it's a scaled version of S, maybe the eigenvalues of Ay are c times the eigenvalues of S. Because if S has eigenvalues s, then Ay has eigenvalues c*s.

So maybe I should first find the eigenvalues of S, then multiply by c to get those of Ay.

What's the matrix S again?

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's compute its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ     -i    |
| i      -λ    |

The determinant is ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0. So λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1. Therefore, Ay has eigenvalues c * 1 = c and c*(-1) = -c.

Given that c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues I got are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Wait, but the eigenvalues are real? Because S is Hermitian? Let me think. The matrix S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Is S Hermitian? Because a Hermitian matrix has real eigenvalues.

Wait, a matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Let's compute the conjugate transpose of S. The original S has elements [0, -i; i, 0]. Conjugate each element: 0, i; -i, 0. Then transpose rows and columns: [0, i; -i, 0]. Which is the same as S only if you compare it, but wait, the original S has first row [0,-i], second [i, 0]. Conjugate transpose is [0, i; -i, 0]. Which is equal to S because first row becomes [0, i] → wait, no. Because original S's first row is [0, -i], and the conjugate transpose's first column would be [0, i]. Hmm, maybe I messed it up.

Alternatively, let me compute S†, the conjugate transpose. For S = [[a, b],[c, d]], S† is [[a*, c*],[b*, d*]]. So for S, a=0, b=-i, c=i, d=0. So S† would be [[0*, i*], [-i*, 0*]] → [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Which is same as the original S. So S is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real. So my initial conclusion holds: eigenvalues are ± c, which are real.

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So their real parts are ±h/(4π) and imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B, which have non-zero imaginary parts, can't be right. So A and B are incorrect.

Now looking
