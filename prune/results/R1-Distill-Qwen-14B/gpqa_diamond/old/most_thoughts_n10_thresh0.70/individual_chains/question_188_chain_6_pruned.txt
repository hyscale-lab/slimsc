Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? From what I remember, a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal too. So it's like a cube that's been deformed a bit, maybe? Oh right, in the rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a three-dimensional figure with six faces, each of which is a rhombus.

Interatomic distanceâ€”oh wait, that's the distance between adjacent atoms along one of the lattice directions. So, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit vectors a, b, and c all have the same length, right? So the lattice constant a would be 10 Angstroms in this case.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a in a simple cubic structure. But in a rhombohedral structure, the unit vectors are all of length a, but the angles between them are all equal to each other, which here is 30 degrees each.

So, I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) )

Wait, but wait. In a general crystal system, the formula is a bit more complicated. For a rhombohedral system, since alpha = beta = gamma = theta (say 30 degrees), the formula can be simplified.

Wait, let me
