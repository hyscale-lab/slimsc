Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the coupled angular momentum state of two electrons. The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I remember that the state is represented as |l1, l2, l, m>, where l1 and l2 are the individual orbital angular momenta, and l and m are the total.

Wait, electrons have spin, but the question says to ignore spin angular momentum. So we're focusing only on the orbital part. Each electron is in a p orbital, which means l=1 for each, right? Because p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, total l is 2, m is -1. I think. Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron, and finding the probability that both are -침.

Wait, the eigenvalues for L1z and L2z would each be m1 * 침 and m2 * 침. So for each, m can be -1, 0, +1. So if we want both to be -침, that means m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

So the problem reduces to finding the probability that m1 is -1 and m2 is -1 when the total state is |1,1,2,-1
