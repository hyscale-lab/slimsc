Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still learning.

The question starts with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Hmm, trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond. Wait, cinnamaldehyde structure is something like CH₂=CH-C(CHO)-, but I think the correct structure is CH₂=CH-C(O)H, right? No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzaldehyde with a propene group attached. So it's more accurately Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, I think cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde of cinnamic acid. So cinnamic acid is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. No, cinnamic acid is Ph-CH=CH-COOH. So the aldehyde would be Ph-CH=CH-CHO? That makes sense. So trans-cinnamaldehyde would have the double bond between the benzene ring and the next carbon. So the structure is benzene ring connected to a CH2 group, then a double bond to CH, and then an aldehyde group. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the double bond between the two CH groups. Oh wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but with a double bond. Wait no, that would make it Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO into Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO with a double bond between the two CH₂, which is not possible because that would be a triple bond. Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. Cinnamaldehyde's structure is a benzene ring (Ph) connected to a CH₂ group, then a double bond
