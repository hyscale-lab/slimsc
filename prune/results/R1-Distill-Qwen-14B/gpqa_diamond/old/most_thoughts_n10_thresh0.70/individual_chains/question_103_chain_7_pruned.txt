Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think about what each step does and how the substituents will end up in the correct positions.

First, I remember that when multiple substituents are added to benzene, their positions are determined by the directing effects of the groups already present. Nitro groups are meta directors, and acetyl groups (like from CH3COCl) are also meta directors, while bromine is a meta director as well. Wait, but the product is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl, which means the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to each other, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so 3 and 5 are adjacent in a way because 5 is across from 3? Wait, let me sketch this mentally. If I number the benzene ring, let's say the nitro group is at position 1, then bromo would be at 3, and another nitro at 5? No, wait, wait, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents on the phenyl ring are at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). So benzene has two substituents: Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Oh wait, but wait, the positions would be meta to each other.

So how do I get there? Let me think about each possible option.

The target molecule is ethan-1-one attached to the benzene ring. Ethan-1-one is acetophenone, so the structure is Ar-C(O)-CH3. So the acetyl group is attached to the benzene ring, which already has Br and nitro groups in the correct positions.

So the plan is to add substituents in such a way that the nitro group and the Br end up in the 3 and 5 positions, and then add the acetyl group. But the order matters because each substitution affects where the next one goes.

Wait, but when you do electrophilic substitution, the order of adding groups affects the positions. Nitro is a strong meta director. Let
