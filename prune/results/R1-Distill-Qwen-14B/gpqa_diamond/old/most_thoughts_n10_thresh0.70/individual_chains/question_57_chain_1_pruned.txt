Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, from what I remember, in scattering theory, especially in nuclear physics, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) is a complex quantity. It's often expressed in terms of phase shifts. The general formula I think is something like:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) (Pl(cosθ)) ) e^{i l (φ - φ0)} )

Wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh right, along the beam direction, θ=0 degrees because the beam is the initial direction. So θ is zero, which probably simplifies things.

Wait, and the scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part, if I recall, is related to the total cross-section. Oh right, because the total cross-section is the integral of the imaginary part over all solid angles. But wait, the question isn't asking about the total cross-section, it's just about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the direction of the beam. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for f(θ=0, φ=0) in terms of the phase shifts. I think at θ=0, the cosine is 1, so Pl(1) is
