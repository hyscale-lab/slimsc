Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The first part talks about substance A1, which is bright red and decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Then there's A3, which can also interact with xenon and is obtained by fluorinating Y. 

Another part says that when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4.

Hmm. I'll need to figure out what each of these compounds could be. Let's start breaking it down.

First, let's think about the element Y. Since the compounds are binary with fluorine, Y is likely a non-metal, maybe in group 16 or 17. Wait, but fluorine is group 17, so Y could be group 16, like oxygen, sulfur, or something else.

A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but A1 is a binary compound. So, perhaps A1 is a fluoride with high oxidation state.

Wait, could A1 be a compound like YF5? Because when it decomposes, perhaps it breaks down into two parts. For example, YF5 → YF3 + F2? Or maybe YF4 → YF2 + F
