Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have magnetic moments that can align in two possible states. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times S_z, right? So mu = γ S_z. Wait, but S_z is the spin operator in the z-direction. So maybe the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin component.

The setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, which makes sense because that's the lowest energy state. So the particle is in the spin-up state along Z.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So initially, the system was in a magnetic field along Z, and then it's switched to Y.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm. I think when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin state will precess around the new field direction.

Wait, but the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. When the magnetic field is suddenly changed to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian would be H = -γ B S_y, since the magnetic field is along Y now. Oh wait, wait—no, because the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, and the energy is given by U = -μ·B. So if B is along Y, the Hamiltonian would be H = -γ B S_y. Or wait, actually, the Hamiltonian for spin in a magnetic field is usually H = -μ·B. So if mu is γ S, then H = -γ B S·n, where n is the direction of the field. So in this case, n is along Y, so H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, no, wait. Let's get this right. The magnetic moment is μ = γ S, so the energy is U = -μ·B. If the magnetic field is along +Y, then U = -γ B S_y. So the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the dot product of the moment and the field, multiplied by -1. So yes, H = -μ · B. So for B along Y, H = -γ B S_y.
