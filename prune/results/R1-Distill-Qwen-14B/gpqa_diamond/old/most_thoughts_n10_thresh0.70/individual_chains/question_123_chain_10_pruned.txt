Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. I remember that in different reference frames, time and distance can be perceived differently, especially at high speeds. Since both are inertial frames, perhaps I should use the concept of relative velocity and time dilation.

So, let's think about the frames. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed v. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in special relativity, the relative speed isn't just additive, right? Because velocities don't add linearly when approaching the speed of light.

Wait a second, that might not be the case here. Oh, wait, no. The problem states both are inertial frames, so maybe they're using the same relative speed but viewed from each other's frames. But let me think again.

Wait, the ejecta's frame observes the Galaxy's center moving at 60,000 km/s towards them. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed must be the same, but direction opposite. Because in inertial frames, the relative velocity is the same but direction reversed. But wait, that's not quite right because of relativity of velocity. Oh wait, no, in classical mechanics, velocity is relative, but in relativity, it's also relative but with a maximum speed (c). Hmm, perhaps we can use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. Let me denote:

In the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S), the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center (so direction is towards S's center, which is perhaps the origin). So from S's perspective, ejecta's speed is v towards the center.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,
