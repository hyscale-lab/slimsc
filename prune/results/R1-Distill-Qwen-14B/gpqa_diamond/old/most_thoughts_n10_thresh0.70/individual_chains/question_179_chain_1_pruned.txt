Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about matrices and their properties in quantum mechanics. There are four matrices given: W, X, Y, Z. And four options, A to D. I need to pick the correct statement.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices are used to represent operators. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to measurable quantities. Also, the evolution operator is unitary, right? Because time evolution should preserve the norm of the state vector.

Wait, so matrices used as observables need to be Hermitian. To check if a matrix is Hermitian, it should equal its conjugate transpose. So, for each matrix, I can compute the conjugate transpose and see if it's equal.

Let's look at the matrices:

Matrix W:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

The conjugate transpose of W (since elements are real) is the same as the transpose. The transpose of W swaps the off-diagonal elements. The original W is symmetric, so W is equal to its transpose. So W is Hermitian.

Matrix X:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

Compute the conjugate transpose of X. Each element (a,b) becomes the conjugate of (b,a). So:

Conjugate transpose of X would be:

(-i, 1, -2i)
(-1, 0, -1)
(2i, -1, i)

Wait, let me see:

Original X rows:
First row: [i, -1, 2i]
Second: [1, 0, 1]
Third: [2i, -1, -i]

Transposing X would make the first column [i, 1, 2i], so the conjugate transpose would have first row as [ -i*, 1*, (2i)* ] which is [-i*, 1, -2i]. Wait, no, wait, the conjugate of i is -i, right? So for the (1,1) element, X was i. So the (1,1) in the conjugate transpose is i*, which is -i. Similarly, (1,2) in X is -1, so (2,1) in conjugate transpose is -1. (1,3) is 2i, so (3,1) is -2i.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

The conjugate transpose is each element a_ij becomes a_ji*, so:

Row 1 of conjugate transpose is first column of X, each element conjugated.

First column of X is [i, 1, 2i]. Conjugate each: -i, 1*, -2i.

Wait, 1 is real, so remains 1. So row 1 of conjugate transpose is [-i, 1, -2i].

Row 2 of
