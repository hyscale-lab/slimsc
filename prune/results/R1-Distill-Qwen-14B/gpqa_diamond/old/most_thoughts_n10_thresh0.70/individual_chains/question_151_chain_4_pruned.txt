Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. The system's state is given as a column vector, and P is a matrix operator.

Wait, I remember from my studies that when you have an observable in quantum mechanics, it's represented by a Hermitian matrix. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So first, I probably need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P. Because the possible results for the measurement of P are its eigenvalues.

Looking at the matrix P given:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, wait, that's interesting. The matrix looks symmetric, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian. So, I should find the eigenvalues of this matrix.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than solving the characteristic equation. Let me think about the structure of the matrix. The diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements have 1/sqrt(2) except for the (1,3) and (3,1) which are zero. Hmm, or wait, looking again: the first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], second is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], third is [0, 1/√2, 0]. So, the matrix is symmetric, as expected.

I remember that for symmetric matrices, especially those with a particular structure, sometimes we can guess the eigenvectors. Let's try to see if there are any obvious eigenvectors.

Let me consider a vector [1, 0, 1]^T. Let's see what P does to it.

P multiplied by [1,0,1]^T:

First entry: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*1 = 0
Second entry: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)
Third entry: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*1 = 0
So the result is [0, sqrt(2), 0]^T. Hmm, not a scalar multiple of the original vector. Maybe not the right guess.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the matrix can be seen as a sum of tensor products or something? Alternatively, let me think about the sum of elements in each row. The first row sums to 1/sqrt(2), the second to (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), the third to 1/sqrt(2). That's not symmetric, so perhaps not the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues by considering the matrix structure. Let me think about the matrix:

It's a 3x3 matrix. Let me denote the rows and columns as 1,2,3.

Looking at rows 1 and 3, they are similar. So perhaps the eigenvectors could have certain symmetries. Another approach: let's note that P is a tridiagonal matrix, but not quite because the (1,3) element is zero. Wait, no, the first row only has a non-zero in the second column, the second row has non-zero in 1,2,3, and the third row has non-zero in the second column. So, it's not tridiagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern or find that P has eigenvalues that are 0, sqrt(2), and something else. Let me think about the trace of P. The trace is the sum of diagonal elements, which is 0 in this case. So the sum of the eigenvalues must be zero.

Hmm, that's a useful point. The trace is 0, so the sum of all eigenvalues λ₁ + λ₂ + λ₃ = 0.

Now, what about the determinant? The determinant of P might help us find the eigenvalues. But calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix is a bit involved. Let me try that.

The determinant of P:

|P| = 0*(0*0 - (1/√2)*(1/√2)) - (1/√2)*( (1/√2)*0 - (1/√2)*0 ) + 0*( (1/√2)*(1/√2) - 0*0 )

Wait, maybe an easier way. Let me write out the matrix and compute the determinant step by step.

P = [
[ 0, a, 0 ],
[ a, 0, a ],
[ 0, a, 0 ]
]

Where a = 1/sqrt(2). So,

The determinant is 0*(0*0 - a*a) - a*(a*0 - a*0) + 0*(a*a - 0*0 )

Hmm, let me compute each term:

First term: 0 * (something) → 0.
Second term: -a * ( (a)(0
