Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question is about finding the probability that a specific atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

Wait, the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that means that the probability it decays in 100 minutes is 0.32. But wait, in 50 minutes it hasn't decayed. Now, they're asking about the probability in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, so maybe I should think in terms of the decay constant or something.

I remember that the decay follows an exponential law. The formula for the number of undecayed nuclei is N(t) = N0 * e^(-位t). But in this case, we're dealing with probabilities for a single atom, so the same logic applies. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is P(t) = e^(-位t). 

Wait, so the probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-位t). Oh right, because if it hasn't decayed, that's e^(-位t), so the decay is 1 minus that.

So first, we know that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. So we can set up the equation: 0.32
