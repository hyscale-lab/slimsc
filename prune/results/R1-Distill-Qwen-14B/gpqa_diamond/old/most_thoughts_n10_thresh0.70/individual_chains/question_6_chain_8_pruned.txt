Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says there's a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two dimensions, it's often helpful to look for separability or see if the potential can be broken down into components that resemble known systems, like harmonic oscillators.

So the potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me try to rewrite this to see if I can factor it or express it in terms of other variables. Let's factor out (1/2)k r²:

V = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me compute:

(1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (k r²) [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express this in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in some cases, using x and y coordinates might reveal a separable potential.

We know that in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(r²).

So substituting that into the potential V:

V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/(r²)).

Wait, let me compute that. The first term is (1/2)k r². The second term is (3/2)k r² * (x²/r²) = (3/2)k x².

So V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, but r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, V becomes:

(1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3
