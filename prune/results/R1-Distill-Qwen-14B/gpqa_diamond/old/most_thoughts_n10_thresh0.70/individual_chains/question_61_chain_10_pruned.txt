Okay, so I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and ending with a final product. I'll try to break down each reaction step to figure out what's happening.

First, benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene is done with a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution with nitration. Nitration typically adds a nitro group as the substituent. Since the first step is forming product 1, which is the nitrated benzene.

Wait, where does the nitro group attach? Benzene is symmetric, so the product should be nitrobenzene. But wait, if benzene is nitrated under certain conditions, does it get a meta or para substitution? Oh wait, nitration of benzene under normal conditions (like using conc. H2SO4 and HNO3) produces mainly nitrobenzene, which is the meta product? No, wait—no, no, wait. Benzene's nitration gives nitrobenzene, which is a meta director. Wait, no, wait. Wait, nitro is a meta director, but when benzene is nitrated once, the product is nitrobenzene, which is a para and meta mixture? No, I think under the conditions of HNO3 and H2SO4, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene as the major product, which is actually para, no—wait. No, no. Wait, wait. Benzene nitrating gives nitrobenzene with the nitro group in the para position? Or is it ortho, meta, para in some ratio? I think the major product is para nitrobenzene, but I might be mixing up with something else. Or wait, no. No, when benzene is nitrated, the nitro group is a meta director. But wait, nitration of benzene gives a mix, with the majority being para? Or is it actually meta? Wait, no, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, which is para. Wait, no, wait. I think the nitration of benzene is a meta director. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Benzene itself is an aromatic ring with all positions equivalent. When nitrated, the nitro group can enter any position. But under standard conditions, the major product is nitrobenzene, which is a single isomer? No, wait, nitrobenzene can have the nitro group in the para or meta positions relative to itself. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so nitrobenzene is a single structure because all positions are equivalent. Wait, no. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with all C's equivalent. So when you nitrate benzene, the nitro group can attach to any carbon, but because of the ring's symmetry, the product is a single structure—nitrobenzene, where the nitro is attached to one carbon, but since the ring is symmetric, it
