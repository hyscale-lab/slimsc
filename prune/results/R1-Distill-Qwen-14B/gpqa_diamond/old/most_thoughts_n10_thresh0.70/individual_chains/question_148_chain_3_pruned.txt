Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully and try to break it down.

The question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. Hmm, binary compounds mean two elements, so Y and F. Fluorine is F, so the compounds are YF something. There are five of them, so Y must have variable valency.

The first part mentions a bright-red substance A1 that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. Oh, wait, 293 K is about 20 degrees Celsius. The oF (standard enthalpy of formation?) for A2 is 31.96%. Not sure about oF notation, maybe it's the molar enthalpy or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's the oxidation state or something else. Wait, maybe "ɷF" refers to the oxidation state? Because the oxidation state is often denoted with Roman numerals, like F has -1, Y could be +1, +2, etc. But the number 31.96% doesn't fit. Maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in the compound? Let's think again.

A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the decomposition reaction is something like A1 → A2 + F2. Since F2 is a diatomic molecule, the decomposition must involve breaking a compound into another compound and F2. So A1 is probably a higher fluoride of Y, and A2 is a lower one. For example, if A1 is YF3, it might decompose into YF2 and F2.

Wait, but fluorine is F2, so let's think about the possible reactions. Also, the question says A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so reactions with it usually involve redox reactions. Fluorine tends to be a strong oxidizing agent. So A1 is likely a strong oxidizing agent itself.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, so it's a binary compound of Y and F. So YF something. Another point is that when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot concentrated solution of A4, a substance A5 is obtained. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the given information:

1. Five binary compounds of Y and F exist. So Y has multiple oxidation states with F.

2. A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2. So the decomposition reaction is A1 →
