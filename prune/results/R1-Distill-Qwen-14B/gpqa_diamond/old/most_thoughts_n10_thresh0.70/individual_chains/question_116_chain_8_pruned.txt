Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit complicated, but I'll break it down.

So, the question starts with compound A. The proton NMR of A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting can tell me about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H suggests maybe a CH3 group attached to something with two neighboring protons. Like maybe a CH2CH3 group? Because each CH3 would split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH2. Wait, but wait: the triplet at 0.9 for 6H could be two equivalent CH3 groups. Let me think, 6H is two CH3 groups. Oh, right, maybe it's a diethyl group because diethyl ether would have two CH2CH3 groups? Or maybe something else.

Wait, the second signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet suggests they're next to a group with three protons. So 4H as a quartetâ€”maybe it's a CH2CH2 group where each CH2 is next to another CH2 with two protons. Or perhaps it's a diethyl group. Wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. In that case, each CH2CH3 would have the CH2 next to the O. The CH3 groups would be triplet because each is next to a CH2 (which has two H's). So for diethyl ether, the CH3 would be triplet around 1.2 ppm. But in the problem, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm. Oh, wait, maybe that's a different structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative, but that might be complicated. Let's think again. If the triplet is 6H, like two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. So maybe it's
