Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about two reactions performed by a chemist. The first reaction uses LAH, and the second uses NaBH4. Then the products are combined and run on different HPLC columns. I need to find out how many peaks there are in each case.

Let's break this down. First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH, followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's LiAlH4. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. But wait, the starting material is a ketone, so that should reduce.

Wait, let me think: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is a six-carbon chain. The ketone is on carbon 3. So, position 3 is a carbonyl group. The 5th carbon has a methoxy group (OCH3). So the structure is: CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-something? Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. Carbon 1: CH3, then CH2, then CO, then CH2, then CH(OCH3), then another CH2 and then maybe a methyl? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO. So position 3 is the ketone. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO-(CH2)3CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-(CH2)3-CH3? Hmm, maybe the structure is more like:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3
