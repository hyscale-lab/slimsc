Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question has two parts, A and B. Each part involves a reaction, and I need to determine the major products from each. Then I have to match them with the options given.

First, let's look at reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is a strong base. So what's this reaction about?

Wait, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, right? The structure would have a spiro junction, with a 5-membered ring and a 3-membered ring? Or wait, no, the spiro notation is [3.5], which means the two rings have 3 and 5 carbons, respectively, excluding the spiro atom. So, the molecule likely has a six-membered ring (I think) with a substituent.

The reaction is in THF with KH and then H+ added. I think that's a deprotonation followed by some kind of acid workup. So, maybe an elimination reaction is happening here. KH is a strong base, so it can deprotonate acidic hydrogens. In alcohols, the alpha hydrogens are somewhat acidic, but here we have a spiro compound.

Wait, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro compound. So the OH is at position 1, attached to the spiro atom. If the base (KH) deprotonates an alpha hydrogen, then maybe an elimination occurs. But wait, the structure might be such that when the OH is deprotonated, it can form a ketone upon acid workup.

Wait, no, because in the presence of a strong base like KH, which is a source of K+ and H-. Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. So it can deprotonate the alcohol. But the alcohol is an spiro compoundâ€”so maybe it's part of a ring structure that can undergo some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of the formation of a ketone from a diol or something similar. Or perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group. When treated with a strong base, maybe an elimination occurs. Since it's a spiro compound, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a double bond, and the ring rearranges.

Let me think about the structure. The spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol would have a 6-membered ring (non is 9 carbons, but wait, the spiro is [3.
