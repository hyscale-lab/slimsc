Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these equilibrium and stability constant problems. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. We're given the stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what these stability constants mean. Stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it forms more readily. So each β corresponds to a different complex. I think the complexes are [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)₂]^+, [Co(SCN)₃]^(some charge), etc. Wait, actually, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+), since Co²+ and SCN^- is -1 each. So for n=1, it's [Co(SCN)]^+, n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^0, n=3: [Co(SCN)₃]^-.

Wait, but the problem mentions "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN groups. So the blue complex is probably [Co(SCN)₂]^+, because I remember that the hexaaquapink complex is [Co(H2O)6]^2+ and the blue one is the dithiocyanato, [Co(SCN)₂]^+. Or wait, maybe not. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact complexes, but the key point is that each β corresponds to a different complex.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β1 is 9, β2 is 40, which is higher, so the second complex is more stable than the first. Then β3 is 63, which is even higher, so the third complex is more stable. But then β4
