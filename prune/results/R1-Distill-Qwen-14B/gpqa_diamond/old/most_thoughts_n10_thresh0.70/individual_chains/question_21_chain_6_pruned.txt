Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. They're divided into constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Oh wait, stereoisomers include things like geometric and optical isomers because their arrangement in space is different, but the connectivity is the same.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

I need to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So for example, in compounds with adjacent double bonds to a carbonyl group, the hydrogen can move, leading to different tautomers like keto and enol forms.

Let me think about benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic diketone. Its structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So it's O=C-C6H4-C=O. I'm trying to visualize: in benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are conjugated with the benzene ring. So does it have any possibility for tautomerism?

I'm not so sure. Wait, in tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. If the structure has adjacent groups that can shift, then it can tautomerize. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups across from each other. But since they're on a benzene ring, are they conjugated in a way that allows for keto-enol tautomerism? Or does the ring structure prevent that?

Wait, maybe I should think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with three =O groups, each separated by a CH2 group. So the molecule is O
