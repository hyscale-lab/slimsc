Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I guess I need to figure out how much acid and base I have and see if they neutralize each other or if there's an excess of one.

The problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. Let me jot them down:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Oh right, because Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions.

I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base first. Moles are calculated by Molarity × Volume (in liters). Let's do that.

Starting with CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, Volume = 0.5 L (500 mL)
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 0.4 L (400 mL)
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M, Volume = 0.3 L (300 mL)
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 has two hydroxide ions per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH⁻. So the moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the total acid comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl⁻. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But when considering neutralization with a base, I think we can treat the H+ from CH3COOH as the amount that's available for reaction, but wait, no, maybe not. Because when an acid and base react, they neutralize each other. So perhaps I should first calculate the total H+ (from both acids) and then subtract the OH- from the base to see what remains.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Let's think about it. Each mole of a strong acid (like HCl) contributes 1 mole H+. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so each mole contributes 1 mole of H+ (but it's not fully ionized; but maybe for the purpose of neutralization, we can treat it as 1 mole H+ per mole of CH3COOH? Hmm, but wait, in reality, weak acids don't dissociate completely, but when you mix with a strong base, some of them will depro
