Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says: We have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. We need to choose the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Alright, let me start by visualizing what this molecule might look like. A di-substituted benzene ring means there are two substituents attached to the ring. The molecule has 8 carbons in total, so the benzene ring (which is 6 carbons) plus two substituents. Each substituent must be a group that adds up to 2 carbons because 6 + 2 = 8. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the benzene is 6 carbons and the substituents would be on the ring, so the substituents themselves may add more carbons. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the ring is probably a benzene ring (6 carbons), and there are two substituents attached to it. Each substituent can be a single carbon or more. But the total number of carbons in the compound is 8. So, the benzene has 6, so substituents must add 2 more carbons. So each substituent must be a group that has 1 carbon each, or one substituent has 2 and the other is a single carbon. But wait, waitâ€”maybe substituents can be like -CH2- groups or other structures.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents would include a carbonyl and a halogen. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like an aldehyde (-CHO), ketone (-CO-) but wait, wait. Let me think: substituents on a benzene ring can be things like -CHO, -COOR, -NO2, etc. Since the FTIR shows a carbonyl, one substituent is a carbonyl group. The other substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), but wait, aromatic halogens are substituents like -X (Cl, Br, I), which are attached directly to the ring. But wait, the carbonyl would be part of a substituent, perhaps a ketone group or an aldehyde.

Wait, wait, but the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Hmm, because 6 (from benzene) + substituents = 8. So substituents sum up to 2 carbons. Let's see.

If one substituent is -X (like Cl, which is a single atom, not a carbon), then the other substituent must have 2 carbons. But wait, the substituents can't be more than that because 6 + 2 =8. Wait, no, wait. The substituents are groups attached to the ring. So each substituent's carbon count is separate. For example, substituent 1 could be a -CHO (which is a carbonyl group) that's one carbon, and substituent 2 could be a -X (like Cl) which is zero carbons. So 1 +0 =1. Then the total would be 6 +1=7. But the compound has 8 carbons. So that doesn't add up. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is a carbonyl group that has more than one carbon. Wait, let me think. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that one is a carbonyl-containing group with two carbons. Let me think about possible substituents.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has 8 carbons, benzene is 6, so substituents have 2 carbons in total. So perhaps each substituent has one carbon each. So substituent 1 is a -COCH3 group or something. Wait, but a carbonyl group would require a carbon attached to O. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a -COOR group, but that's more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -CHO (1 carbon) and -Cl (no carbons). So total is 1, then benzene plus substituents is 7, but the molecule has 8. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -COOH (carboxylic acid, which is -COOH, which is two carbons: the COOH is OOH-C-O, but wait, no: the carboxylic acid is -COOH, which is one carbon (the COOH is attached to the benzene). Wait, no: the COOH group has a structure R-COOH. So in that case, the R
