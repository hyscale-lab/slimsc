Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture that's shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining on it along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it. So first, when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern. The angular positions of these minima depend on the shape of the aperture.

Wait, the problem says N is infinitely large. Oh right, as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Wait, no. Wait, if the apothems are all the same length, a, then when N is large, the shape tends toward a regular polygon, but as N approaches infinity, a regular polygon becomes a circle. But wait, in that case, the aperture would be a circle with radius equal to the apothem times something. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) by a = R * cos(π/N). But when N is very large, the polygon is almost a circle, so the apothem a is approximately equal to R because the angle π/N becomes very small, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1. So R ≈ a. That means the radius of the circular aperture would be approximately a. Or wait, is the apothem the radius of the circle? Wait, in a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius because all sides are equidistant from the center. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, this polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the problem is effectively about a circular aperture.

Wait, but then why is the question about a polygon? Because for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is well-known. The minima occur at angles θ where sinθ = mλ / (π a), for m = 1,
