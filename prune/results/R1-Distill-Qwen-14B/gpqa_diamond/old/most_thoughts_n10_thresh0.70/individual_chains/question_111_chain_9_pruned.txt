Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Then, I'll choose the correct option from the given choices.

First, let me look at reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this sounds like an enolate formation and alkylation or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, but ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe this is a Michael addition reaction. In such reactions, the enolate of the ketone (the cyclohexanone derivative) would attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

But wait, the starting ketone is a substituted cyclohexanone. Let me think about the structure. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 1. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6: position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me draw it out mentally.

Cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone (O) at position 1. So the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. So position 2 is ethyl, and position 6 is methyl? Or wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl: so position 2 has both ethyl and methyl? No, wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. So the structure has substituents on carbons 2 and 6.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of chair conformations. The ketone is at position 1, so the chair would have the carbonyl group axial or equatorial. But for enolate formation, the bulky groups will influence where the deprotonation occurs.

t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So it's going to abstract the less hindered proton to form the enolate. The enolate would form at the alpha position (adjacent to the ketone). The alpha carbons are positions 2 and 3 (since the ketone is at 1). Wait, no, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6.

Wait, in the starting compound, C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached. So when forming the enolate, which position is more favorable? The less hindered one. So looking at C2 and C3 (or C6?), which is less substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps the base will abstract a proton from the less hindered alpha position. Let me think. The cyclohexanone has substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). So the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. Wait, no, wait: in a cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1. The alpha carbons are C2 and C6. So, the enolate would form at either C2 or C6, but considering substituents.

So C2 has an ethyl and a methyl, making it more substituted. C6 has a methyl group (so less substituted than C2). So the base would prefer to abstract a proton from the less substituted position, which is C6. Wait, but wait, when considering steric hindrance, perhaps the more substituted position is harder to deprotonate. So the enolate would form where the base can approach more easily.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate forms in a position that leads to the most stable enolate. The more substituted the double bond, the more stable the enolate. So if the enolate is formed at C2, which is more substituted, that would be more stable. But wait, C2 has more substituents, so the enolate would be more substituted and thus more stable.

Wait, but the base is bulky. t-BuOK prefers to deprotonate the less hindered site. So if C2 is more hindered (with ethyl and methyl groups), then C6 is a better site for deprotonation because it's less hindered. So the enolate would form at C6.

Wait, but if the enolate forms at C6, then when the Michael addition occurs, the nucleophilic enolate would attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. But let's think about the structure of ethyl acrylate. It's CH2=CHCOOEt, right? So the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester is CH2CH2COOEt, but actually, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CHCOOEt. So the Michael donor would
