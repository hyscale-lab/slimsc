Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then combining the products and running them on HPLC columnsâ€”standard and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes forms epoxides. So for each of the alkenes, Reaction 1 and 2, they react with mCPBA to form epoxides.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are E and Z isomers. Epoxidation typically proceeds via an electrocyclic ring-opening mechanism, but for mCPBA, it's more about the stereochemistry. Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but wait. mCPBA is an oxidizing agent that adds an epoxide across the double bond. The reaction is an electrocyclic opening, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the diastereomer formed.

Wait, let me think. For a trans (E) double bond like (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxidation would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. Wait, no. Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry. Let me recall. The addition of mCPBA is via a cyclic transition state, leading to the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The reaction of mCPBA with an alkene forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms add syn to each other. Because mCPBA is a peracid, which in epoxidation adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide with the same configuration as the
