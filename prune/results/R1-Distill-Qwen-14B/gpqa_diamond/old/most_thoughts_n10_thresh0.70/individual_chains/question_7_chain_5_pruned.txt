Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The process is γγ → e+ e-. I remember that the CMB photons have an average energy given as 10^-3 eV.

Wait, so the problem is about the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with CMB photons. Gamma-rays are high-energy photons, right? So when they collide with CMB photons, they can annihilate into electron-positron pairs. This must be a process that affects the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe. If their lifetime is limited by this process, it probably means that they don't travel as far as they would otherwise because they're annihilating.

I think this relates to the concept of photon-photon interactions and the mean free path of these gamma-rays. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. If the mean free path is short, the photon's lifetime is limited because it interacts quickly and doesn't travel far.

So the mean free path (λ) is given by the inverse of the interaction probability per unit length. The interaction probability depends on the cross-section (σ) and the density of the target photons (n).

The interaction cross-section for two photons (γγ) to produce electron-positron pairs is probably given by some formula. I'm trying to remember... I think the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is proportional to the square of the energy or something like that. Let me think. The cross-section σ for this process might scale with the square of the center-of-mass energy (s) to some power. Oh, right! I remember that the cross-section for pair production has a threshold. The process can only happen if the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the electron mass.

Wait, the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV. So for a photon to produce an e+ e- pair, it needs to collide with another photon whose energy is enough to meet the threshold. But here, the CMB photons are low energy, about 1e-3 eV. So the high-energy gamma (E) plus the CMB photon (E_cmb) must sum to at least 2m_e c^2. So E + E_cmb ≈ E (since E is so much larger than E_cmb) must be greater than 2 * 0.511 MeV. But wait, since the gamma is high energy, E is much larger than the CMB photon energy. So E_cmb is negligible compared to E, so E needs to be greater than 2 * 0.511 MeV, which is about 1.022 MeV. But in this problem, the gamma-rays are much higher energy than that, so the process is allowed.

But wait, the problem gives the average CMB photon energy as 1e-3 eV, which is 0.001 eV. But wait, the CMB is a blackbody spectrum at about 2.7 K, so the average photon energy is much lower than that. But perhaps the calculation uses that average energy for the cross-section.

The cross-section σ for γγ → e+ e- is usually a function of the center-of-mass energy. The formula I think is:

σ ≈ (some constant) * (s)/(m_e^2) ) * [ln(s/m_e^2) - something] ... wait, no, perhaps it's the Klein-Nishina formula or something else. Alternatively, I remember that for high-energy photons, the cross-section for pair production off the CMB is approximately σ ≈ (8π/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (s) ) * something... Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the photon-photon cross-section for pair production.

Alternatively, I recall that the cross-section for this process is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (s) ) * (ln(s/(4 m_e^2 c^4)) - 1)

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. Maybe it's easier to use a more approximate formula or think in terms of scaling.

Wait, but for high-energy photons where E γ is much larger than m_e c^2, the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E^2), where E is the gamma energy. Because when s = (E + E_cmb)^2 ≈ E^2 (since E>>E_cmb), so the cross-section is inversely proportional to E squared.

So σ ≈ k / E^2, where k is a constant involving m_e and other factors.

Then, the interaction probability per unit length (P) would be σ * n, where n is the number density of CMB photons.

The number density n of CMB photons can be found from the CMB temperature. The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The photon number density in a blackbody is given by n = (2.72e3 cm^-3) * (T / 2.7 K)^3. So T is 2.7 K, so n ≈ 2.72e3 cm^-3 ≈ 2.72e-4 m^-3? Wait, wait: 1 cm^-3 = 1e6 m^-3? Wait, no, 1 m^3 = 1e6 liters, and 1 liter is 1e3 cm^3, so 1 m^3 = (1e3 cm)^3 = 1e
