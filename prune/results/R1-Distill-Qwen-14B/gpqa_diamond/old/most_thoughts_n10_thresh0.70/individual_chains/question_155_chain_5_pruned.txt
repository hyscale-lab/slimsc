Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. Alright, I remember that uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Let me write that down. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might simplify things because if the state is an eigenstate of P_z, then the expectation value of P_z would just be the eigenvalue. But wait, the state here is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. Hmm, so the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, but it's an eigenstate of P_x. Interesting.

Wait, the matrix forms of P_x, P_y, P_z are given. Let me see. P_z's matrix is diagonal, right? Looking at the rows: first row has (hbar, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-hbar). So the eigenvalues are hbar, 0, -hbar. So the basis vectors would be the standard basis vectors, probably? Because P_z is diagonal. So the state is expressed in that basis.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Let me check that it's normalized. The sum of squares is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 2/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 =1. So yes, it's normalized.

Now, to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² )

But wait, if the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, then P_z |ψ> = <ψ| P_z |ψ> |ψ>, meaning that the expectation value <P
