Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step. 

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how dark spots affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that dark spots on a star can change its overall temperature, which in turn affects the ionization states of elements in its photosphere. 

So, the star's normal (without spots) parameters are 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Its effective temperature (Teff) when not spotted is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The key point here is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) which is greater than 1.

I think this has to do with the Saha equation because it relates the ionization states and the population of energy levels in stars. The Saha equation describes how the ionization states of atoms change with temperature and density. But wait, the problem is about the ratio of two energy levels of the same ion, not ionization. Oh, right, so maybe the Boltzmann equation applies here. 

The Boltzmann equation deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states. The ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Here, g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, since Ti is neutral, the ionization isn't the issue here—just the excitation between two energy levels. So, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 would depend exponentially on temperature. 

The wavelength given is about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. The energy difference between the two levels can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ. 

So, let's compute the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ. 

h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters. 

Calculating ΔE: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, for the Boltzmann factor, we usually express it in terms of energy per (k*T), so let's compute (ΔE)/(k T). 

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, (ΔE)/(k T) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23 * T). 

Wait, but T is different in the two cases: without spots (T1=6000 K) and with spots (T2=5500 K). 

So the ratio of the Boltzmann factors would be [ (ΔE/(k T1) ) ] compared to [ (ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Wait, wait. Let's think
