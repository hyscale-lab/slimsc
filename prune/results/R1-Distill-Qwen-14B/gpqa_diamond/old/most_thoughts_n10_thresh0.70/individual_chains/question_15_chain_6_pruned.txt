Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time.

Wait, what factors affect the probability of a planet transiting its star from our point of view? I remember that the probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, more accurately, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor related to the inclination, but I think that's already accounted for in the formula.

Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is given by (R_star / a) * (1/(1 - e²))^½, but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that simplifies to R_star/(a*(1)), so R_star/a. But wait, also, I think there's a geometric probability which is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since the planet radius is much smaller than the star, R_planet can be neglected, so it's approximately R_star/a.

But wait, another factor comes into play: the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.
