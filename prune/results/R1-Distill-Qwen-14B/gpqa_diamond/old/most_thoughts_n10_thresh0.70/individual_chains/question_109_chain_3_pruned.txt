Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and some quantum numbers. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says it's a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. I remember that parity has to do with whether a wavefunction is even or odd under spatial inversion. But wait, particle X's parity is -1, so it's like an odd intrinsic parity, maybe like a pion or something.

Pauli statistics are involved here. The question states that for the final NN state, T(NN) equals S(NN) plus L(NN) plus 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what each symbol represents. T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. Oh right, Pauli exclusion applies to identical particles. So the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric for identical fermions.

The initial state is 1S0. So let's parse that term symbol. The general form is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1 â†’ S=0. So S=0. L is S, which is 0 (s-state), so L=0. And J is 0. So the initial NN state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit particle X, so the final state is the initial NN plus X. But I think the question is about the transition from the initial state to the final state after emission. So the final state is NN in some state, and X in some state.

Wait, the question is about the partial waves not permitted. So, when the NN system emits X, the angular momentum and spin of the final NN state must satisfy certain conditions due to conservation laws and Pauli's exclusion.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So T=0. Since isospin is involved, but maybe I can think in terms of the conservation of parity and angular momentum.

The problem says to use conservation of angular momentum and parity. So, we need to consider how the initial and final states' angular momenta and parities relate.

The initial state, I think, is the 1S0 state. So the NN system has L=0, S=0. So the initial parity for the NN system would be (-1)^L. Since L=0, (-1)^0=1. So parity is +1 for the NN system.

When they emit X, the parity of the entire system (before and after) must be conserved. Wait, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The parity of the final state (NN + X) should equal the parity of the initial state times the parity of the emitted particle X.

Wait, the initial state is just the NN system, which has parity P_initial = (-1)^L = 1. After emission, the system is NN plus
