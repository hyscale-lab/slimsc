Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning they have apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V, so apparent V mag ≤16. So a star needs to be bright enough for both.

Wait, but how do I find the apparent magnitude of each star? Each star gives different info. Some give absolute magnitude and distance, others apparent magnitude, and some have extinction to consider.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent mag (m) at 10 pc. So since it's at 10 pc, m = M = 15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. That's under both 16 and 17, so both spectrographs can detect it. But wait, can the telescopes actually observe it? Oh, but the question says to disregard pointing limits, so just check the magnitudes.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5. So for ESPRESSO (max 17), 16.5 is okay. But HIRES requires ≤16, so 16.5 is too faint. So Star2 can't be detected by HIRES, so it's out.

Star3: Apparent V mag 15.5. But wait, there's E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. Oh right, interstellar extinction. The V band has extinction which affects the apparent magnitude. The formula is m_observed = m_true + A_V. And A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the actual apparent magnitude is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag. Oh, because the extinction makes it dimmer, so apparent mag increases. So Star3's apparent V is 17.36. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so it's just over. So ESPRESSO can't detect it. HIRES can't either because 17.36 is way above 16. So Star3 isn't detectable by either, so it's out.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says for the spectrographs, the stars must be brighter than 17 (so m≤17 for ESPRESSO) and brighter than 16 (so m≤16 for HIRES). So Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is too faint for both. So Star3 is out.

Star4: Absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So at 10 pc, m is 15.5. Then E(B-V)

Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to astronomy, so let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But the question is about their brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means any star with V less than 17 (since lower magnitude is brighter) can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, stars with V <16 can be detected.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the way it's phrased is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, no, the V magnitudes brighter than 17. So brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So that means ESPRESSO can observe stars down to V=17. So any star with V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so V magnitude less than 16? Or greater? Hmm. No, wait, wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent
