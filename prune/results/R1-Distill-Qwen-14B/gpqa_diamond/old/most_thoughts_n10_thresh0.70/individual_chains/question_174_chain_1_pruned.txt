Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. No other products, just the two. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.

We're supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are given in MeV, so I think the answer will be a small number in that range.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, let's define some variables. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m. Then the heavier one is 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m, and this is 99% of M. So, 3m = 0.99 M, which means m = (0.99/3) M. Therefore, the lighter fragment has m = 0.33 M, and the heavier has 0.66 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait. Let me double-check. 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99/3) M. So yeah, m = 0.33 M, and 2m is 0.66 M. So the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M, which is less than the original M. That makes sense because in nuclear reactions, mass can be converted into energy (like binding energy), so the rest mass after might be less.

But wait, the initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. But in our case, when the nucleus is at rest, its energy is just M c². When it splits into two fragments, the total rest mass is less, so some energy is released as kinetic energy.

Okay, so the initial rest mass is M. The two fragments have rest masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M. So the total rest mass after is 0.99 M, which is 99% of M. So the mass loss is 1% of M. Because 0.01 M c² would be the energy released, right? But wait, that's assuming that all the mass difference goes into kinetic energy. But maybe that's not the case because in reality, each fragment has kinetic energy, and the total energy is conserved.

Wait, but the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum before is zero. After the fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must cancel each other out.

So, let's model this. Let me think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

Initial energy is just M c². After fission, the energy is the sum of the rest masses plus their kinetic energies
