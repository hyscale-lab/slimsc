Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. After this treatment, two different diketones are produced. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds are treated with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O, they undergo specific reactions. Oh wait, sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid usually form nitrous acid (HNO2), which is involved in diazotization, but that's more for aromatic amines. Or maybe it's for aliphatic compounds? Wait, another thoughtâ€”maybe it's about the formation of ketones from secondary alcohols via some kind of reaction. Or perhaps it's a dehydration reaction?

Wait, another possibility: I think that treating secondary alcohols with certain conditions can lead to the formation of ketones. Oh wait, wait, I think it's the Stephen reduction or something else, but no, Stephen is for ketones to aldehydes. Or maybe it's the oxidation of alcohols. Oh, no, wait, oxidation of primary alcohols gives aldehydes or carboxylic acids, and secondary alcohols give ketones. But what's the role of HCl, NaNO2, and H2O here?

Wait, another thing comes to mind: the formation of geminal diols from ketones. No, wait, that's with something else. Or maybe the
