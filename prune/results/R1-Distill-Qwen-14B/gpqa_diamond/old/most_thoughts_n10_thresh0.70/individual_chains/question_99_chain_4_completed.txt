Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a COOH group at the end. So, the compound is a carboxylic acid.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak in the IR around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, especially in carboxylic acids because they have strong hydrogen bonding. The peak at 1700 is probably the carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which makes sense for a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data: there are several signals, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, like in alkenes. So the structure isn't something with a double bond, which aligns with the options given since all of them are single bonds except maybe where the COOH is.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each splitting comes from neighboring protons. So, a doublet means two peaks, triplet three, quartet four, etc.

Let me first consider the possible structures. They all have a COOH group. Let's look at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure is CH2COOH connected to a central carbon, which is connected to two CH(CH2CH3) groups? Wait, not exactly. The formula is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the main chain is COOH attached to a central CH2CH2 group? Wait, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the central part is two CH2 groups, but actually, each is a CH with two CH3 groups attached? Not sure, perhaps it's a geminal di-substitution on each of two central carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw each structure:

Looking at the options, they all have a chain with substituents and a COOH group. For example, option D might have a structure like (CH3CH2)-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So, two central carbons, each with a CH3 and a H, connected to each other, and then the COOH at the end.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the structure would be (CH3CH2)-C(C2H5)(H)-C(C2H5)(H)-COOH. So, each of the two central carbons has a C2H5 group and a H attached.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, the structure is CH2-COOH attached to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to another CH(CH3) group.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the CH2COOH is attached to a CH(C2H5), which is connected to another CH(C2H5). So, maybe the structure is (CH2CH3) groups attached to the central CH groups.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals. The problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. That suggests that each proton is coupling with multiple sets of neighboring protons.

In an NMR, each splitting comes from adjacent protons. So, for example, a triplet usually means two neighboring Hs. But when you have more complex splitting, like a doublet of triplets, that could mean that each proton is split by two different sets of neighboring Hs. 

Let's take the example of a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. The Hs on CH2 would each couple with the adjacent CH2's Hs, leading to a triplet. But if each H is also coupled with another group, the splitting gets more complex.

Wait, but in the given options, the structures are more complex. Let me think about each option's possible NMR signals.

Looking for which structure would produce such complex splitting. Let's consider the substituents.

In option B, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, each of the two central C atoms has a H and a C2H5 group. So, each central C has H attached, and each is connected to another central C which also has H and C2H5.

So, the H on each of these central Cs would be adjacent to Hs on the adjacent C. Let's think: each H on a central C is next to another H on the adjacent C.

Wait, but each central C is connected to two others: the CH2CH3 and the COOH group. So, the H on a central C would have neighboring Hs from the adjacent central C.

Wait, perhaps the structure is like:
COOH-(C)-CH2CH3 and -(C)-CH2CH3 connected in a chain? Or perhaps the two Cs are adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2CH3.

Wait, no, looking at option B's formula: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH connected to C, which is connected to another C, which is connected to CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps it's:

CH3CH2- [C(H)(C2H5)] - [C(H)(C2H5)] - COOH.

So, the two central Cs each have a H and a C2H5 group, and are connected in a chain.

So, the H on each C would be adjacent to the H on the next C. So, each H is next to two Hs on the adjacent C. Wait, no, each C has one H. So, each central H is adjacent to the H on the neighboring C. So, for each H, the neighboring H would be 1 H on the adjacent C, right? Because each C has only one H.

Wait, but each C is connected to another C, so each H is adjacent to the H on the adjacent C. So, each H would have one neighboring H, leading to a doublet. But that's not matching the given NMR data, which has more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe each H is coupled with more than one set of Hs. Let me think about the structure.

Another approach: looking for symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some protons might be equivalent, leading to fewer signals. But in the question, the NMR has several signals, so perhaps some are equivalent and others are not.

In option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, the formula is CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, it's:

CH3 connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to another CH(CH3), then CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-CH2COOH. So, the two central carbons each have a CH3 and a H.

So, each of those Hs would be adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring carbons. So, that H on the first CH would be next to the H on the second CH, and the second CH's H is next to the first's. But each CH has only one H. So, each H is next to one H on the adjacent C.

In that case, each H would see one neighboring H, so each would be a doublet. But the NMR shows more complex splitting.

Wait, but each H is also connected to other parts. Let me think about the structure. Each CH group is connected to CH(CH3) on both sides? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH has more than one neighboring group. Let's consider the splitting for each H.

In the structure of option C, the CH2COOH is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to another CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH3. So, the H on the CH(CH3) next to CH2COOH would be adjacent to the H on the next CH(CH3). So, each H has one neighbor, so a doublet. But wait, perhaps each H is also coupled with the Hs on the adjacent CH3 groups? No, because CH3 groups are attached to the same C, so their Hs are equivalent and don't split each other. Wait, but the H on the CH is adjacent to the H on the next CH, so each H would be a doublet. But the NMR shows more complex splitting, so this may not fit.

Looking back at the NMR data, the signals are a doublet of triplet of quartets and a doublet of triplet of triplets. That suggests each proton is split by multiple neighboring groups.

Another approach: looking at the splitting patterns. The first signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Let me break that down. Each split comes from a neighboring group. So, for a doublet, it's split by one neighbor (n=1, so 2 peaks). Then, a triplet comes from another neighbor (n=2, so 3 peaks). Then a quartet from another neighbor (n=3, 4 peaks).

Wait, but how does that happen? Let's think about a proton that has three different neighboring groups. Or perhaps each split is from a different set of neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, maybe each H is next to two different groups, each of which causes splitting. For example, a proton next to two different CH2 groups, each contributing their own splitting.

Wait, let's think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: COOH-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, it's:

CH3 connected to a CH(C2H5), which is connected to another CH(C2H5), which is connected to CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH3.

Wait, maybe it's a four-carbon chain, with two middle carbons each attached to a C2H5 and a H. So, the middle part is CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3), with CH2COOH on one end and CH3 on the other.

In this case, looking at the Hs on the middle CH(CH2CH3) groups. Each H on these CHs would be adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH.

So, each H is next to one H on the next CH. That would give a doublet. But perhaps each H also has other neighboring Hs from the CH2 groups.

Wait, the CH2COOH group would have Hs on the CH2. Those Hs are next to the H on the adjacent CH(CH2CH3). So, the Hs on the CH2 (from COOH-CH2-) would be adjacent to the H on the next CH. So, each of those Hs on the CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet. But the CH2COOH group's Hs would not be the same as the CH(CH2CH3) Hs.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about each part.

The problem mentions that none of the NMR signals are vinyl, so no alkenes.

In the options, all structures are branched. Let me think about the possible diastereotopic Hs or any symmetry that would cause equivalent Hs.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So, the structure is COOH connected to a C, which is connected to another C. Each of these Cs has a CH3 and a H. So, the structure is:

COOH-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but the formula is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two middle Cs each have a H and a CH3 attached. So, each of those Hs is on a C adjacent to another C with a H. So, each H on the middle Cs is next to the H on the adjacent C. That would lead to each H being a doublet. But again, the NMR shows more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the splitting arises from more than just the adjacent Hs. For example, each H is adjacent to two different sets of Hs, leading to more splitting.

Let me think about the splitting in the NMR. The first signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets. So, each H is split first into a doublet (n=1), then each peak in the doublet is split into a triplet (n=2), and then each of those is split into a quartet (n=3). So, the total would be 2 × 3 × 4 = 24 peaks, but that's probably simplified, but the pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with three different groups, each contributing their own splitting. For example, a proton could be next to a CH2 group (two Hs), a CH (one H), and another CH2 group (two Hs), leading to multiple splits.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure has a CH group that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups and another CH group. Let me think about option A again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH.

So, the two middle CHs each have a H and a C2H5 group. The CH2COOH is on one end and the CH3 on the other.

The Hs on the middle CHs are each adjacent to the H on the next CH. So, that would be a doublet for each. But perhaps each CH is also adjacent to the CH2COOH group's Hs. So, the H on the CH next to CH2COOH would be split by the two Hs on the CH2 group, leading to a triplet. Wait, that could be.

So, let's imagine the H on the CH next to CH2COOH. It's adjacent to the H on the next CH (so a doublet) and also adjacent to the two Hs on the CH2COOH group. So, each of these Hs would split into a triplet. But wait, the splitting from the CH2 group would be from the two Hs, making a triplet. So, the H on the CH would first be a doublet (from the adjacent CH H) and each of those peaks would be split into a triplet (from the CH2 group's Hs). So, the result would be a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on the other CH (the one closer to the CH3) would be adjacent to the H on the first CH (splitting into a doublet) and perhaps the CH2 group farther away? Wait, or maybe it's adjacent to the CH2 group. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, in option A, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So, the two middle CHs are each connected to a C2H5 and a H. The first CH is connected to the CH3 group and the next CH. The next CH is connected to the CH2COOH.

So, the H on the first CH is adjacent to the H on the next CH (so a doublet) and perhaps also to the Hs on the CH2COOH group. Let me think: the H on the first CH is two bonds away from the CH2 group. Would that cause coupling? I'm a bit rusty on this, but vicinal coupling (across two bonds) can sometimes occur but is usually weaker and might not be observed. Alternatively, perhaps the H on the first CH is only adjacent to the H on the next CH, leading to a doublet. But then, the H on the next CH is adjacent to both the H on the first CH and the Hs on the CH2COOH group.

So, the H on the next CH (closer to the CH2COOH) would be adjacent to the H on the first CH (doublet) and the two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Ah, that would fit one of the signals being a doublet of triplets. The other signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a more complex splitting. So, perhaps that H is coupled with three different sets of Hs.

Wait, another possibility is that the Hs on the CH groups are also adjacent to the C2H5 groups, but since the C2H5 groups are split into multiple Hs, perhaps they contribute to the splitting.

Wait, but the C2H5 group is a single substituent, so each H on the CH is only adjacent to the H on the next CH and the CH2 group's Hs. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2COOH group's Hs are each split by the Hs on adjacent CHs. Let me think about the CH2COOH group. Its Hs are on a CH2 next to a CH group. So, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the CH group. So, each H on the CH2 would be a doublet (from the adjacent CH H). But if the CH group's H is itself a doublet, that might complicate things further.

Wait, perhaps it's the CH2 group that's causing the more complex splitting. Let me think about the CH2 group adjacent to the CH(CH2CH3) groups.

Wait, let me consider another approach. Let's look for the number of signals in the NMR. The question says several peaks are observed. So, perhaps the structure has multiple sets of non-equivalent Hs.

Option B: the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the two middle CHs each have a C2H5 and a H. The Hs on each CH are adjacent to the H on the next CH.

So, each H on the middle CHs would see the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet. But perhaps each of these Hs is also next to the CH2 group's Hs. If the CH2 group (from CH3CH2-) is adjacent to a CH, then the Hs on the CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. Similarly, the H on the CH would be split by the CH2's Hs (two Hs, leading to a triplet) and the adjacent CH's H (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets or something like that.

Alternatively, the H on the CH may be split by both the adjacent CH and the CH2 group's Hs. So, each H on the CH would be a doublet (from the adjacent CH) and each of those would be split into a triplet (from the CH2 group), leading to a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the Hs on the CH2 group would be split by the adjacent CH's H, leading to a doublet of triplets as well.

Wait, but in the options, the number of signals depends on the symmetry. For example, in option B, are the two middle CH groups equivalent? Let me see: each CH is attached to a C2H5 and a H, and connected to another CH(C2H5). Since the structure is symmetric (both CHs are identical), the Hs on each CH would be equivalent, so only one signal for both. Similarly, the CH2CH3 groups are both C2H5, so their Hs would be equivalent, but the question says none of the signals are vinyl, so no problem there.

But wait, the question states that several peaks were observed, which suggests more than one signal. So, perhaps the structure isn't symmetric, leading to more signals.

Looking back at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: COOH connected to a C, then another C, each of which has a CH3 and a H. So, the structure is COOH-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2CH3.

In this case, the two middle CHs each have a CH3 and a H. Are these CHs equivalent? If the molecule is symmetric around the central axis, then the two CHs would be equivalent, leading to a single peak for their Hs. But if not, they would be different.

Wait, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, no. Let me look again. The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the backbone is: COOH connected to a C, which is connected to another C, which is connected to a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

COOH - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2CH3.

So, the two middle Cs each have a H and a CH3 attached. So, the structure is symmetric if the two middle Cs are identical. But wait, the COOH is on one end and the CH2CH3 is on the other. So, the two middle Cs are each attached to CH3 and H, and connected to each other. So, the structure is symmetric, making the two Hs equivalent. Thus, their NMR signals would be a single peak, perhaps a doublet (if each H is adjacent to the other), but that's not matching the given data.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the splitting in the NMR. The signals are a doublet of triplet of quartets and a doublet of triplet of triplets. That suggests each proton is coupled with multiple different sets of neighboring Hs.

Another possibility is that the Hs are on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. For example, the structure could be:

CH2-A-CH-B-CH2.

Where A and B are substituents. Then, the Hs on the middle CH would be adjacent to the Hs on both CH2 groups, leading to more complex splitting.

But in the given options, I'm trying to see which structure would lead to such splitting.

Wait, let me think about the splitting in each option.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH3 - C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2COOH.

Each of the two middle CHs has a CH3 and a H. The Hs on these CHs are adjacent to each other, so each would see one neighboring H, leading to a doublet. But perhaps they are also adjacent to the CH2 group's Hs. So, the Hs on the middle CHs would be split by both their adjacent CH H and the CH2 Hs.

So, each H on the middle CH would have two neighboring Hs: one from the adjacent CH (n=1, doublet) and two from the CH2 (n=2, triplet). So, each would be a doublet of triplets. But then there's another signal which is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Hmm.

Wait, the CH2COOH group's Hs would be adjacent to the H on the middle CH. So, each H on the CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH. That would make each CH2 H a doublet (from the adjacent CH H). But if the CH H is itself a doublet, that would cause more splitting. Wait, perhaps each CH2 H is split into a doublet by the CH H, which is itself a doublet, leading to a doublet of doublets. But that doesn't match the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH is also split by another group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is next to two different CH groups. So, each H on the CH2 would be split by Hs on two different CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 would be split into a triplet (n=2), but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

In this structure, the two middle CHs each have a C2H5 and a H. The Hs on these CHs are adjacent to each other (each seeing one H), leading to a doublet. But the CH2COOH group is next to a CH, whose H is a doublet. So, the Hs on the CH2COOH would be split by the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. But then, perhaps each of these Hs is also adjacent to the Hs on the other CH, leading to more splitting.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of neighboring Hs each H has.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from the CH2 group being adjacent to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, the Hs on the central CH would be split by both adjacent CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So, each H on the central CH would be split into a quartet (n=3: two from each adjacent CH2? No, wait: each adjacent CH2 has two Hs, so each coupling would be n=2. So, two CH2 groups would lead to (n+1)(n'+1) = (2+1)(2+1) = 9 peaks. But that's a triplet of triplets, which is a doublet of triplet of triplets? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to determine which of the four options has a structure that would produce such complex NMR splitting.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure:

COOH - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2CH3.

So, the two middle Cs each have a CH3 and a H. These Hs are adjacent to each other, leading to a doublet. The CH2CH3 group's Hs would be adjacent to the H on the middle C, leading to a triplet. So, the Hs on the CH2CH3 would be a triplet of doublets? Or perhaps each is a doublet.

But this doesn't quite match the given data.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure:

COOH - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2CH3.

The two middle CHs each have a C2H5 and a H. The Hs on these CHs are adjacent to each other, so each would be a doublet. The CH2CH3 group's Hs are adjacent to the H on the middle C, leading to a triplet. So, the CH2CH3 Hs would be a triplet.

But again, this doesn't quite fit the given NMR data.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure:

CH3 - C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2COOH.

The two middle CHs each have a CH3 and a H. The Hs on these CHs are adjacent to each other (doublet). The CH2COOH's Hs are adjacent to the H on the middle C, leading to a triplet. So, the CH2COOH Hs would be a triplet, and the middle CH Hs would be a doublet.

But the question mentions that one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets and another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. So, perhaps this is not the correct structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure:

CH3 - C(C2H5)(H) - C(C2H5)(H) - CH2COOH.

The two middle CHs each have a C2H5 and a H. The Hs on these CHs are adjacent to each other (doublet). The CH2COOH's Hs are adjacent to the H on the middle C, leading to a triplet. So, the CH2COOH Hs would be a triplet, and the middle CH Hs would be a doublet.

But wait, the CH2COOH group is at the end, so its Hs are on the CH2. Those Hs would be adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH. So, each H on the CH2 would be a doublet (from the adjacent CH H). But the CH H is itself a doublet (from the adjacent CH H). So, the CH2 Hs would be split by the CH H, which is a doublet, leading to a triplet for each CH2 H. So, each CH2 H would be a triplet. But in the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which is a more complex pattern.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is option A. Let me think: the Hs on the middle CHs are each adjacent to one H (so doublet). The Hs on the CH2COOH are adjacent to the H on the middle CH, leading to a triplet. Additionally, perhaps the CH2COOH Hs are also adjacent to another group, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on the middle CHs are also adjacent to the C2H5 groups, but since C2H5 is a single substituent, each H on the CH would only see the H on the adjacent CH.

Wait, but the C2H5 groups are ethyl groups. Maybe the Hs on the CH are not only adjacent to the H on the next CH but also to the Hs on the adjacent C2H5 groups. But wait, the C2H5 groups are on the same C as the H, so their Hs are on the same C. So, the H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the next CH and possibly the Hs on the C2H5 groups on the same C. But wait, the H on the CH is on a different C than the C2H5's Hs. So, no, the H on the CH is not adjacent to the Hs on the C2H5 group; those are on the same C as the H on the CH.

So, perhaps the Hs on the middle CHs are only adjacent to the H on the next CH, leading to a doublet.

But then, why are there more complex splitting patterns in the NMR? Maybe I'm missing some other coupling.

Wait, perhaps the splitting comes from the fact that each H is coupled with multiple Hs from different groups. For example, a H on a CH could be coupled with two Hs from a neighboring CH2 group and another H from a CH group, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, let's imagine a scenario where a CH is next to a CH2 group, and the CH2 group is next to another CH. So, the H on the CH would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and the H on the next CH. That would lead to (n=2 for CH2) and (n=1 for CH), so the splitting would be (2+1)*(1+1) = 6 peaks, which is a triplet of doublets.

But in the question, the splitting is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which suggests three levels of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with three different groups: each contributing a different level of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a branching that leads to each H being adjacent to multiple Hs from different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A. Let me think again:

Structure of option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

So, the two middle CHs each have a C2H5 and a H. The Hs on these CHs are adjacent to each other, leading to a doublet. But the CH2COOH group's Hs are adjacent to the H on the middle CH, leading to a triplet. Now, the Hs on the middle CH are also adjacent to the Hs on the C2H5 groups. Wait, no, because the C2H5 groups are attached to the same C as the H. So, the H on the CH is not adjacent to the Hs on the C2H5 group; those are on the same C.

So, perhaps the H on the middle CH is only adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet. The Hs on the CH2COOH are adjacent to the middle CH's H, leading to a triplet.

But the question mentions that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three levels of splitting. So, perhaps each H is coupled with three different groups, each with different numbers of Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure is option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: COOH - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2CH3.

The two middle CHs each have a CH3 and a H. The Hs on these CHs are adjacent to each other, leading to a doublet. The Hs on the CH2CH3 group are adjacent to the H on the middle CH, leading to a triplet. So, the CH2CH3 Hs would be a triplet.

But the NMR data has a signal that's a doublet of triplet of quartets, which doesn't fit this.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of neighboring Hs for each H.

Let me think of the correct structure as having a central CH that's adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So, the central CH's H would be split by two CH2 groups, each contributing a triplet. So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets (n=2 for each CH2), leading to (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks. But the question says a doublet of triplet of quartets, which suggests a different pattern.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider the integration or other details, but the question doesn't provide that.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals in the NMR. The question says 'several peaks were observed', but none correspond to vinyl Hs. So, the structure must have multiple distinct H environments.

Option D: the two middle CHs are identical due to symmetry, so their Hs would be one signal. The CH3 and CH2CH3 groups would have their own signals. So, maybe three signals: middle CH Hs (doublet), CH3 (singlet?), and CH2CH3 (triplet). But the question says 'several peaks', so more than two or three.

Alternatively, option A: the two middle CHs are asymmetric due to the different substituents (C2H5 groups), but wait, both middle CHs have the same substituents, so they would be equivalent. So, their Hs would be a single peak. The CH3 at the end would be a singlet, and the CH2COOH's Hs would be a triplet. So, three signals again.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3 - C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2COOH.

The two middle CHs are each attached to a CH3 and a H. Are these CHs equivalent? If the molecule is symmetric, the two CHs would be equivalent, leading to a single peak for their Hs. The CH2COOH's Hs would be adjacent to the middle CH Hs, leading to a triplet. The CH3 groups would be in equivalent positions, leading to a singlet.

But the NMR data mentions several signals, which would fit if the structure has more than two environments. Wait, but if the two middle CHs are equivalent, the Hs would be a doublet (from each other), but perhaps the CH2COOH's Hs are a triplet, and the CH3s are a singlet. So, three signals, which the question says 'several', which could mean more than two. So, perhaps this is not the case.

Wait, another angle: the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is consistent with an -OH group, like a carboxylic acid. So, all the options have a COOH group, so that doesn't help distinguish.

Looking back at the NMR splitting, perhaps the correct structure is option A, where the Hs on the middle CHs are coupled with both the adjacent CH H and the CH2COOH Hs, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is option B, where the Hs on the middle CHs are coupled with the CH2CH3 group's Hs.

Wait, perhaps option B's structure has the middle CHs adjacent to a CH2CH3 group, whose Hs could cause more splitting.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the number of neighboring Hs each H has.

The NMR signals are a doublet of triplet of quartets and a doublet of triplet of triplets. Each of these implies a proton that is coupled with three different groups, each with a different number of neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps one H is coupled with n=1, n=2, and n=3, leading to the observed pattern.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: the quartet suggests n=3, which would come from a CH2 group with three neighboring Hs. Wait, no, a quartet comes from n=3 (four peaks) which usually indicates coupling with a CH2 group (two Hs, so n=2, leading to triplet).

Wait, perhaps the quartet comes from a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 group with two Hs and another CH group with one H, leading to 2+1=3, so n=3, quartet.

So, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH2 group (two Hs) and a CH group (one H), leading to a quartet (n=3). Then, each of those would be split further by another group.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should try to choose the most plausible option.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

In this structure, the middle CHs each have a C2H5 and a H. The CH2COOH is at the end. The Hs on the middle CHs are adjacent to each other (doublet). The Hs on the CH2COOH are adjacent to the H on the middle CH (triplet). Additionally, the CH2COOH Hs are adjacent to the Hs on their own CH2 group, which are two Hs, leading to a triplet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the H on the middle CH is adjacent to the H on the next CH (doublet) and the Hs on the CH2COOH group (triplet). So, each H on the middle CH would be a doublet of triplets. And the Hs on the CH2COOH would be a triplet of doublets.

But the question mentions a doublet of triplet of quartets and a doublet of triplet of triplets. So, perhaps this isn't quite matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option B.

Wait, option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

In this structure, the middle CHs each have a C2H5 and a H. The Hs on these CHs are adjacent to each other (doublet). The CH2CH3 group's Hs are adjacent to the H on the middle CH (triplet). But perhaps the Hs on the CH2CH3 group are also adjacent to the Hs on the other middle CH, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the CH2CH3 group's Hs are adjacent to two Hs on the middle CHs, leading to a quartet. But each middle CH has only one H, so the CH2CH3 Hs would be adjacent to two Hs (one from each middle CH), leading to a triplet (n=2). So, each H on the CH2CH3 would be a triplet.

But then, the Hs on the middle CHs would be a doublet of triplets, as they are adjacent to each other (doublet) and to the CH2CH3 Hs (triplet).

Wait, that would fit one of the NMR signals being a doublet of triplet of quartets. No, perhaps not.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option A has a CH2COOH group at the end. Its Hs would be adjacent to the H on the middle CH. So, each H on the CH2COOH would be a doublet (from the adjacent CH H). But the CH H is itself a doublet (from the adjacent CH H), so the CH2 Hs would be a doublet of doublets, which is a quartet. So, the CH2COOH Hs would be a quartet.

But the question says one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which suggests three levels of splitting. So, perhaps the CH2COOH Hs are split by the middle CH H (doublet), and the middle CH H is split by another group, leading to a triplet. But I'm not sure.

After considering all options, I think the correct structure is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Because the CH2COOH Hs would be adjacent to the middle CH H, leading to a triplet, and the middle CH Hs would be adjacent to each other and the CH2COOH Hs, leading to more complex splitting, matching the NMR data.


To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the given FTIR and 1H NMR data alongside the four structural options. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, characteristic of an O-H stretch, and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl (C=O) group, indicating the compound is a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR data reveals several signals, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, and two specific splitting patterns: a doublet of triplet of quartets and a doublet of triplet of triplets. These patterns suggest complex coupling between protons on adjacent carbons.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**
- The structure is CH₃-C(H)(C₂H₅)-C(H)(C₂H₅)-CH₂COOH.
- The two middle carbons each have a CH group with a C₂H₅ and a H. These CH groups are adjacent to each other, and their Hs would couple, leading to a doublet.
- The CH₂COOH group at the end is adjacent to the CH group, and its Hs would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet.
- The CH₂COOH Hs are also adjacent to the CH₂ group, which has two Hs, causing further splitting. This results in a complex splitting pattern, consistent with the observed NMR data.

#### **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**
- The structure is CH₃CH₂-C(H)(C₂H₅)-C(H)(C₂H₅)-COOH.
- The two middle carbons each have a CH group with a C₂H₅ and a H. These CH groups are adjacent to each other, and their Hs would couple, leading to a doublet.
- The CH₂CH₃ group at the end is adjacent to the CH group, and its Hs would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet.
- However, the splitting patterns described in the NMR data do not fully align with this structure, as the CH₂CH₃ group does not introduce the expected complexity.

#### **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**
- The structure is CH₃-C(H)(CH₃)-C(H)(CH₃)-CH₂COOH.
- The two middle carbons each have a CH group with a CH₃ and a H. These CH groups are adjacent to each other, and their Hs would couple, leading to a doublet.
- The CH₂COOH group at the end is adjacent to the CH group, and its Hs would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet.
- However, the splitting patterns described in the NMR data do not match this structure, as the CH₃ groups do not contribute to the observed complexity.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- The structure is CH₃CH₂-C(H)(CH₃)-C(H)(CH₃)-COOH.
- The two middle carbons each have a CH group with a CH₃ and a H. These CH groups are adjacent to each other, and their Hs would couple, leading to a doublet.
- The CH₂CH₃ group at the end is adjacent to the CH group, and its Hs would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet.
- However, the splitting patterns described in the NMR data do not fully align with this structure, as the CH₃ groups do not introduce the expected complexity.

### Conclusion:
Option A best matches the NMR data. The CH₂COOH group at the end introduces a complex splitting pattern due to coupling with the adjacent CH group and its own CH₂ group, consistent with the observed doublet of triplet of quartets and doublet of triplet of triplets. The other options fail to account for the observed splitting complexity.
