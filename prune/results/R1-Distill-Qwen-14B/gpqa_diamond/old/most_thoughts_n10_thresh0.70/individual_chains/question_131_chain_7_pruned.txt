Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about the dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene, forming an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The key part is the NOESY NMR spectra, where the major has a cross-peak and the minor doesn't or is weak. The question is which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

First, I need to break down the information.

1. **Dehydration of Dicarboxylic Acid:**
   The starting material is a cis-diacid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride. Since the alkene is cis, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. Wait, but wait, when a diacid with a double bond undergoes dehydration, the product is usually a cyclic anhydride. The structure would depend on where the double bond is. If the double bond is between the two carboxylic acid groups, then upon dehydration, it would form a cyclic anhydride, probably a five-membered ring because that's more stable.

   Looking at the NMR data for the anhydride: 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the hydrogen environments are equivalent and maybe in an aromatic region, but wait, the product is an anhydride, not an aromatic compound. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated anhydride. Because the starting material has a cis-alkene, and dehydration would form a double bond in the anhydride.

   Wait, the 13C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is likely a carbonyl group (anhydride carbonyl). 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to a double bond, maybe a vinyl carbon. So the structure would have a conjugated double bond adjacent to the anhydride.

   So the anhydride is possibly something like a cyclic structure with a double bond and two carbonyls. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm, which is high for an alkene. Typically, vinyl protons are around 5-6 ppm. Wait, but if they're in an aromatic ring, maybe. But no, the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene, so the anhydride is probably not aromatic. Hmm. Maybe the singlet comes from some kind of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the protons are in a deshielded environment, but I'm a bit confused here. Wait, another possibility: if the anhydride has a structure where the double bond is part of a conjugated system, perhaps leading to some symmetry, making all the protons equivalent.

   Maybe the structure is a five-membered ring with two ester groups. For example, something like:
   
   O=C-O
   || 
   C-O=C-O
   connected in a ring. If the double bond is between the two carbonyl groups, then maybe the protons adjacent to it are equivalent, leading to a singlet. But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this part. Let me think again.

   The 1H NMR has a single peak, which suggests that all the protons in a certain environment are equivalent. So perhaps all the non-exchangeable protons, like the ones on the cyclop
