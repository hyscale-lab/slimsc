Okay, I need to figure out which statement about the Mott-Gurney equation is correct. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage behavior in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited conditions. So, when the current is limited by the electric field created by the space charge itself, rather than other factors like material properties or injection.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V^2)/(L^3). I think this equation applies to a specific scenario. From what I recall, the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain assumptions. Let me think about what those assumptions are.

First, I remember that the derivation ignores things like trap effects. So the material should be trap-free. Also, it's for a single-carrier device, meaning either electrons or holes, but not both. Two-carrier devices would complicate things because of the different mobilities and other factors. So options that mention two-carrier can probably be eliminated. Looking at the options, option D talks about a two-carrier device, which might not be right.

The equation also assumes that the contacts are Ohmic, not Schottky. Ohmic contacts have a low barrier, so they don't impede the carriers much. Schottky contacts have a potential barrier, which might affect the current flow differently. So any option that mentions a Schottky contact, like option C, might not be correct.

Another point is about current components. The equation is for space-charge-limited current, so drift current is dominant. But wait, in the derivation, I think the diffusion current is considered negligible. Or is it the other way around? No, wait. In SCLC, the space charge creates a strong field, so drift dominates over diffusion. But in the Mott-Gurney derivation, I think they neglected the diffusion current, assuming that the space charge is so effective that the current is mainly due to drift. Or maybe the diffusion is not the main factor here. So the equation holds when diffusion is negligible.

Looking at the options again. Option A says "Ohmic contact and negligible drift current." Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If drift current is negligible, then maybe the equation wouldn't apply. Because in SCLC, drift is the main factor. So I think the equation assumes drift is significant and diffusion is negligible. So the correct scenario would be when diffusion current is negligible.

Let me check each option:

Option A: Trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic, negligible drift. If drift is negligible, the equation wouldn't apply. Because the equation is for when the current is due to drift. So this might be incorrect.

Option B: Trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic?), negligible diffusion. So the equation would apply here. Because it's trap-free, single-carrier, and diffusion is negligible. That seems to fit.

Option C: Schottky contact. Don't think so, because the equation assumes Ohmic contacts. So this is probably wrong.

Option D: Two-carrier and Ohmic. But equation is for single-carrier. So D is incorrect.

So the correct statement would be option B. It's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no injection barriers (Ohmic) and negligible diffusion current.


The Mott-Gurney equation, which describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, is derived under specific assumptions. These assumptions include a trap-free environment, a single-carrier device (either electrons or holes, not both), and negligible diffusion current, as drift current dominates in this regime. Additionally, the equation assumes Ohmic contacts, which have low potential barriers, rather than Schottky contacts, which introduce significant barriers.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. This is incorrect because the equation applies when drift current is significant, not negligible.

- **Option B** states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the assumptions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is derived, making it correct.

- **Option C** mentions a Schottky contact. This is incorrect because the equation assumes Ohmic contacts, not Schottky contacts, which would complicate the current flow.

- **Option D** refers to a two-carrier device. This is also incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, not two-carrier systems.

Thus, the correct statement is **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.

Answer: B
