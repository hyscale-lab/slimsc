Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it's probably an addition reaction.

But wait, what's the product here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl, so it's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons, so wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN or something else. Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, which is four carbons in a row, with the nitrile on the fourth. But the product has 2-hydroxy-2-methyl, so maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, that would be five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN is added, the cyanide ion (CN-) would attack the carbonyl carbon. So in a ketone addition, the product would be a cyanohydrin. Right, because adding CN- to a ketone gives a cyanohydrin, which is R2C(OH)CN.

So the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. So butan-2-one ( (CH3)2CO
