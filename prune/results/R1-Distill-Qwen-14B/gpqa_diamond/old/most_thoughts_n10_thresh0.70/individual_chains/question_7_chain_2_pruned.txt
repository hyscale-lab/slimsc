Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is like the afterglow of the Big Bang, right? Its photons have really low energy. The question is about when high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I need to find out at what gamma-ray energy their lifetime is limited by this process.

So the process is γγ → e+ e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, so that's really low. So the CMB photon is not very energetic at all.

I think this has to do with photon-photon collisions. When a high-energy gamma-ray meets a CMB photon, they can annihilate into electron-positron pairs. But for this to happen, the energy needs to be sufficient. I remember something about the threshold energy for pair production.

The threshold condition for pair production occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to create the rest mass of an electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so for the pair, it would be twice that, 1.022 MeV. But wait, in the center of mass frame, the total energy must be at least 2m_e c². But wait, in the lab frame, how does this work?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of the invariant quantity, the square of the center-of-mass energy. The invariant s is (k1 + k2)^2, where k1 and k2 are the four-momenta of the two photons.

Each photon has energy E1 and E2, and since they're moving in opposite directions (since they collide), their momenta are in opposite directions. The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 (since they are moving towards each other). Wait, but for photons, E = pc, so for photon 1, p1 = E1/(c), and photon 2, p2 = E2/(c), but since they're moving opposite, maybe p2 is negative? So the spatial part becomes (p1 - p2). Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

Wait, let me think again. The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)². Because for photons, the momenta are in opposite directions, so p2 is in the opposite direction of p1. So if photon 1 is moving in the +x direction, p1 is +E1/(c). Photon 2 is moving in the opposite direction, so p2 is -E2/(c) (since it's moving in -x direction). So the total momentum is p1 - p2 (since p2 is negative). So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - (-p2 c))²? Wait, no. Let me get
