Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum, so we're focusing only on the orbital part. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. 

So, I remember that in angular momentum coupling, the state is defined by the individual angular momenta of each particle (l1 and l2), the total angular momentum quantum number l (which is the sum of l1 and l2 when they're aligned), and m, the z-component of the total angular momentum.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. L1z and L2z are the z-components of the orbital angular momenta for each electron. Wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum quantum number is l1 and l2, which are both 1 in this state. So each Lz (L1z and L2z) can take values from -l to +l in steps of 1. Since l is 1, the possible values are -1, 0, +1. So each L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that makes sense because when two p orbitals (l=1 each) couple, the maximum possible total l is 2. Because l can be |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2, so 0,1,2. So here, the total l is 2, and m is -1.

So, the state is a specific coupled state. The question is about measuring both L1z and L2z and finding the probability that both are -ħ.

Hmm, I think the approach here is to express the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states, because the uncoupled basis states are products of individual states. Each state is |l1, m1> |l2, m2>, where m1 is the z-component for the first electron, m2 for the second.

The coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of these uncoupled states. Then, the probability we're looking for is the square of the amplitude of the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, because L1z and L2z are measured, and each would give their respective m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ. So for both to be -ħ, m1 must be -1, and m2 must be -1. So the term in the expansion that has m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is the one we need to find.

So, how do you expand the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> into the uncoupled basis?

I remember that the expansion coefficients are related to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients allow you to write the coupled states in terms of the uncoupled ones.

The general formula is:

|l1, m1> |l2, m2> are the uncoupled states.

The coupled state is a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M. So for |1,1,2,-1>, M is -1.

So the expansion would be:

|1,1,2,-1> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <1,m1; 1,m2 | 2, -1> ] |1,m1> |1,m2>

So the coefficients are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure about the values. I think I should look for the possible combinations where m1 + m2 = -1, and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for that.

Possible m1 and m2 pairs that add up to -1:

m1 can be -1, 0, 1. Similarly for m2.

Looking for m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1.

m1 = 1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So that pair is invalid.

So the only valid pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, but when I think about the coupled state |2, -1>, I think the expansion is a sum of |1, m1> |1, m2> with m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible terms are |1, -1> |1, 0> and |1,0> |1, -1>, but wait, are those the only possibilities?

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, for the coupled state |2, -1>, the expansion is a linear combination of |1, m1> |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1).

Wait, wait, m1 can be -1,0,+1 and m2 can be -1,0,+1, but their sum must be -1.

So:

-1 + 0 → -1

0 + (-1) → -1.

But wait, what about m1 = 1 and m2 = -2? No, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1.

So only two terms.

So, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = sqrt( ... ) [ |1,-1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> ]

Wait, but the exact coefficients? Hmm.

I think the coefficients for the Clebsch-Gordan series when L=2 and M=-1.

I remember that for L=2,
