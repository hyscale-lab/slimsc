Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the energy levels of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through step by step.

The question says that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. They also mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, I remember that m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, so small m might mean that l is small as well, like maybe l=1 or 0. Or wait, no, m is about the electrons' spin? Or no, wait, orbital magnetic quantum number is l, right? Oh, I get confused sometimes. Spin is s, which is 1/2 for electrons, but orbital is l. Oh wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for the orbit, which is from -l to +l. So small m could mean that l is small, like maybe l=0 or 1. But I'm not too sure how that plays into this problem yet.

The problem is asking me to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether the coupling is much larger, smaller, or similar to ΔE.

I think the paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman effect term, right? The Zeeman effect is when an external magnetic field causes the splitting of atomic energy levels. So the Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. And the magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

Wait, wait. Or is it the orbital magnetic moment that's being considered here? Because the question mentions orbital magnetic quantum number m. Oh, wait, orbital and spin are separate. So in the Zeeman effect, there are two contributions: one from the orbital angular momentum and one from the spin. But when the problem refers to the paramagnetic coupling term, maybe it's referring to the spin-orbit coupling. Or perhaps in this context, it's specifically the spin part, since paramagnetism comes from unpaired electrons, which have spin.

Wait, but the question says 'paramagnetic coupling term', which I think refers to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron due to its spin and the external magnetic field. So the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian would be H_para = γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator. Alternatively, perhaps H_para is proportional to m_s, the spin magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but let's clarify. The paramagnetic term arises from the spin magnetic moment. So the energy due to this would be H_para = -μ·B, and μ for spin is μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. So for electrons, μ = -g_s μ_B m_s, where m_s is ±1/2.

But perhaps I should approach this by calculating the magnitude of the param
