Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question says we have a di-substituted six-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, that's interesting because a benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the compound is di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached to the ring. So each substituent contributes to the total carbons. Let's see, benzene is six carbons. The total is eight, so the substituents add two carbons. Oh, but wait, each substituent could be a single carbon, so two substituents would add two carbons. Or perhaps one substituent is a two-carbon group.

Wait, but wait. The aromatic ring is six-membered, so the substituents are attached to two of the ring's carbon atoms. Each substituent would add a certain number of carbons. For example, if one substituent is a methyl group (1 carbon) and the other is a something else, maybe another one carbon, adding up to two in total. Wait, but 6 (benzene) plus 2 (substituents) gives eight? Oh, yes, that's right. So each substituent is a one-carbon group. Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other none, but that can't be because it's di-substituted. So both substituents contribute one carbon each, making two in total. So the substituents are probably each a single carbon group, like two methyl groups, but wait, no, because the problem says the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, wait, that's important. So, the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, so the substituents on the benzene ring must include a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So perhaps one substituent is an -OCH3 group (methoxy) and another is a carbonyl-containing group? Wait, but the substituents also add up to two carbons. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the total number of carbons
