Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to make product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product 3, with options given as A to D.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out the structures of each product step by step. Let me start by recalling the reactions involved.

First, toluene reacting with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). I remember that nitration is a typical reaction for aromatic compounds. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration introduces a nitro group. Since toluene is methylbenzene, the nitration would probably occur at the para position because the methyl group is a strong activating group, and the para position is more substituted and thus more stable for the nitro group. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, right? So structure would be methyl group attached to benzene ring with a nitro group in the para position.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. For nitrotoluenes, oxidation under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid. Wait, but para-nitrotoluene would oxidize. Let me think: oxidation of toluene derivatives. The methyl group attached to the benzene ring with a nitro group. The methyl group is in the para position relative to the nitro.

Wait, when toluene is nitrated, the nitro group goes into the para position. So the structure is benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group opposite each other. Now, when this is oxidized, the methyl group would be oxidized. The oxidation of a methyl group attached to benzene usually goes through a nitro group as well, perhaps? Or is the nitro group a meta-directing group?

Wait, but the oxidation conditions: MnO2 and H2SO4. I think that the methyl group attached to the nitro group (which is in para) would oxidize to a carboxylic acid. So the methyl becomes COOH. But wait, methyl group is attached to the ring, and oxidizing it would give a COOH group. So product 2 should be para-nitrobenzoic acid. Let me draw this: benzene ring with a nitro group and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions. So nitro and COOH are opposite each other on the ring.

Now, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Hmm, acetone is a ketone, and in basic conditions, it might undergo some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but product 2 is an aromatic compound with two substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? No, wait, acetone is a dienophile in some cases. Oh wait, maybe product 2 is undergoing a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I'm not
