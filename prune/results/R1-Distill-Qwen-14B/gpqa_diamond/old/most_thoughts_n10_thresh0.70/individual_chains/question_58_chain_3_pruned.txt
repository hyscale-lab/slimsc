Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what do I remember about regularization? I think regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results, which don't make physical sense. So you regularize the theory, which means you introduce some sort of cutoff or modification to make the infinities manageable, and then you take the cutoff to infinity in a controlled way.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization when dealing with high energies. That probably means the theory is already finite or doesn't produce these divergences.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything. It deals with high energies because it incorporates gravity and is supposed to work at all scales. But wait, string theories require a lot of things like supersymmetry and extra dimensions. Don't they have issues with divergences? Or do they avoid them somehow? I'm a bit confused. I think string theory might have different behavior because the fundamental objects are strings instead of point particles. Maybe in string theory, the perturbative expansions don't diverge as badly as in some other theories. Or perhaps they require regularization because of other reasons, like non-perturbative effects.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that at high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, and quarks behave almost like free particles. But wait, QCD calculations often involve things like the running of the coupling and renormalization group techniques. Renormalization is a form of regularization, right? Or maybe more accurately, renormalization deals with the divergences that appear in loop calculations. So QCD would require regularization because even though it's manageable at high energies (asymptotic freedom), the perturbative expansions still generate divergences that need to be handled.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED is a renormalizable theory, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have divergences. In fact, QED has issues with things
