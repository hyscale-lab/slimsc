Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that the operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options are combinations of these, and I need to pick which combination is correct.

Wait, first, what do I remember about symmetries in effective field theories? SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, right? These operators have to maintain certain symmetries that the Standard Model already respects.

Lorentz symmetry is fundamental. All the SM interactions are Lorentz-invariant, so any operator added must also be Lorentz-symmetric. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense because the laws wouldn't look the same in all reference frames. So option 1 is definitely a must-respect symmetry.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the theory has a Poincare symmetry, it must have both. But wait, in the SMEFT framework, do the operators have to be invariant under Poincare? Well, the SM is Poincare-invariant, so the effective theory should also respect that. So operators must respect Poincare. So 2 must be correct.

CP symmetry is a bit trickier. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM isn't CP-symmetric, because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP necessarily. Because the SM itself doesn't, so adding operators that break CP isn't an issue. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't a must-respect symmetry. So 3 is out.

CPT symmetry is another thing. I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that are Lorentz-invariant must respect CPT symmetry. CPT stands for Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT. Because, I think, the combination of C, P, and T transformations brings you back to a Lorentz frame where the physics looks the same. So if an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? They must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a secondâ€”does Poincare symmetry require more than just the operators being there? Because Poincare includes translations, which are about the theory being the same everywhere (because of special relativity). Well, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, so all operators must be Lorentz-invariant. And since Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations, the operators must also be invariant under translations. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Because when you write operators, they're usually built from fields at the same point, so they have to be local, which would respect translation in
