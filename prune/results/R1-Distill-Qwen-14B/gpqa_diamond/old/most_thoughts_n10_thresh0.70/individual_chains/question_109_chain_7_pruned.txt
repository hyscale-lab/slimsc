Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T(NN)=0, and I need to find which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in such reactions, both angular momentum and parity are conserved. So I need to apply both conservation laws.

Let me break down what I know. The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So here, S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum.

In the initial state, 1S0: (2S+1)=1 implies S=0, because 2*0 +1=1. L is S in spectroscopic notation? Wait, no, the S is for spin, and the L is the orbital part. So 1S0 means S=0, L=0 (since S is the spin part, and the L is given by the letter: S=0, P=1, D=2, etc.). Wait, no, no, wait. The term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So the S in 1S0 is the spin multiplicity. So 1S0 would be spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0 (since S is the state, but wait, S is the orbital angular momentum letter? Or is it the spin? Hmm, maybe I got that mixed up.

Wait no, the letters are for orbital angular momentum. So S corresponds to L=0, P to L=1, D to L=2, etc. So in 1S0, the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since
