Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about reacting a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate. The epoxide in question is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and it's being reacted with Me2CuLi. The options are four different cyclohexanol derivatives, and I need to determine which one is the product.

I remember that when epoxides react with organocuprates (like Gilman reagents), it's a conjugate addition or maybe a nucleophilic attack. Oh wait, organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and they tend to open epoxides. But wait, how exactly does that happen?

Epoxides are strained three-membered rings. When they react with nucleophiles, the nucleophile attacks the less substituted (less hindered) carbon because that's where the partial positive charge is higher. But wait, the question says that the alkyl group of the reagent is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So the organocuprate's methyl group (since Me2CuLi is the reagent) will add to the less substituted carbon of the epoxide.

But wait, the question also mentions that in disubstituted epoxides,
