Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The question gives six different benzene derivatives and asks about the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when each undergoes this reaction. I need to arrange them from the lowest to the highest weight fraction of the para product.

Hmm, let me remember what I know about electrophilic substitution. The bromine acts as the electrophile here, so the position where it adds depends on the directing groups present in each compound. Activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions, and deactivating groups do the opposite.

Each of the given compounds has a substituent attached to the benzene ring. Let me list them again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethy benzene, I think)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, no, correction: 5 is ethyl benzene, so the substituent is an ethyl group. The substituents are:

1) Methyl (CH3)
2) Esters (COOEt)
3) Chlorine (Cl)
4) Nitro (NO2)
5) Ethyl (C2H5)
6) Carboxylic acid (COOH)

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups are electron-donating, which make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho, para positions. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive and directing to meta positions.

So, let's categorize each substituent:

1) Methyl (CH3) is an activating group because the methyl is an electron donor through the sigma bond (it's an alkyl group). So it's ortho/para-directing.

2) COOEt (ester group): The ester is a deactivating group because the oxygen in the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So it's a meta director.

Wait, wait. Wait, ester groups are ortho/para directors, but deactivating? I think they are deactivating but ortho/para directors. Because the ester has a carbonyl which is electron-withdrawing, but the lone pairs from the oxygen can donate through resonance, but maybe not as strong as activating groups. So yes, esters are deactivating (so the ring is less reactive) but are ortho/para directors.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a halogen. Halogens are a bit tricky. They are deactivating because the electronegativity of Cl makes the ring less electron-rich. But they are ortho/para directors because the lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons through resonance when the ring is activated. So Cl is a meta director? Wait, no. Wait, halogens are ortho/para directors but deactivating. Right, because although the ring is less reactive, the Cl's lone pairs can still direct the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions.

4) NO2: Nitro groups are strongly deactivating (due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect) and meta-directing. So para is not favored here; the substitution happens mainly in meta.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): Similar to methyl, it's an activating group because it's an alkyl group. So it's an ortho/para director.

6) COOH: Carboxylic acid group. The COOH is a strong deactivating group because of the electronegative oxygen. It's meta-directing. Because the carboxylic acid is a strong acid, the ring's electron density is low, so the substituent directs meta.

Now, when a substituent is present, the position where the bromine adds depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating and whether it's ortho/para or meta-directing.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each compound, what's the major product when bromine is added? Also, considering steric factors because some substituents may lead to more para than ortho due to steric hindrance.

Wait, but bromine is added in excess, so it's a monobromination. The position will depend on the substituent's directing effect.

Let me analyze each compound.

1) Toluene (methyl group): Activating, ortho/para. So the bromine can add to ortho, para. But in monobromination, under what conditions does it form more para? Wait, typically, without steric hindrance, activating groups can lead to more para than ortho because of the substituent's position. But I might need to think about the relative amounts.

Wait
