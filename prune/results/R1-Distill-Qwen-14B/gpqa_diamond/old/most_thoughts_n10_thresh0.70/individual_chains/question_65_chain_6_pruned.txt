Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem has two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. The options are given, so I'll focus on each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH (potassium hydride) is a strong base, maybe used for deprotonation. Wait, but in some cases, especially when ketones are present, it could also be used for elimination reactions or maybe even as a base for enolate formation. But wait, this compound is a spiro compound. Spiro indicates that two rings are connected by a single atom. So, let's imagine the structure: the molecule has a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected at the same carbon. There's a double bond at position 5, and a vinyl group attached at position 1.

When this is treated with a strong base like KH, perhaps it deprotonates a beta hydrogen, leading to an elimination. Wait, but wait, after that, there's an acidic work-up with H+. Or maybe the reaction is an example of a ring-opening or some kind of cyclization. Another thought: the starting material has a spiro structure, and maybe under basic conditions, it undergoes some kind of ring expansion or ring-opening followed by a cyclization.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that usually involves ketones. Alternatively, since there's a hydroxyl group (the "-ol" suffix), maybe it's undergoing an E2 elimination. But the structure has a spiro ring system, so elimination could form a larger ring or rearrange the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of acid-catalyzed cyclization. Wait, no, the initial step is with
