Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about an alien spacecraft traveling at a very high speed towards Earth. The aliens have a spacecraft that goes at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the question is asking how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are whether they'll die before reaching, or other time frames like 72, 81, or 77 years.

Hmm, I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity. So, from the astronaut's perspective, the journey time would be less than what someone on Earth would see. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the different frames here.

Wait, the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so their frame is the moving frame relative to Earth. So, from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving very fast, but the astronaut's own time would experience less time due to time dilation.

Wait no, actually, time dilation works such that the moving clock (the astronaut's) runs slower from the perspective of a stationary observer (like on Earth). But wait, no, that's the other way around. Wait, the moving clock is the one that ticks slower. So Earth would see the astronaut's clock as running slow. But from the astronaut's point of view, Earth is moving very quickly, so the distance to Earth would be length contracted.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of proper time. Proper time is the time experienced by the traveler. So the astronaut's proper time would be less than the time experienced by someone else in a different frame.

Right. So the key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is given by the time measured in the moving frame (the spacecraft) and depends on the velocity and the distance.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh wait, perhaps I can find that. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance is roughly about 160,000 light-years from Earth. Let me check that. Yeah, I think that's the approximate distanceâ€”about 160,0
