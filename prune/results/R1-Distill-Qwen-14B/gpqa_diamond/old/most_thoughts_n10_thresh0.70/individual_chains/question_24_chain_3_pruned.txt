Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a mixture X that undergoes some reactions, leading to mixture Y and eventually to a substance Z. I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

First, let me parse the information given. 

Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually means they have unsaturation, like double or triple bonds. So X must have components with alkenes or alkynes since they can add bromine, causing the solution to decolorize.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction leading to mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, so one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Since Pt is a catalyst, maybe it's a hydrogenation or something else. But wait, upon treatment with Pt and heat, the mixture Y is formed, and Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y's compounds are saturated, maybe alkanes? Because alkanes don't react with bromine water, so they don't decolorize it.

So X's components are unsaturated (like alkenes or alkynes), and Y's are more saturated. But wait, the reaction is a disproportionation, which is a type of redox reaction where one species is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps X has a component that can both lose and gain hydrogen?

Wait, another thought: maybe X is something like cyclopropane or another strained ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a diene or a dienophile. But since it's a mixture, maybe X has two different unsaturated compounds, each contributing to decolorizing bromine water.

Moving on, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they give a single hydrocarbon Z. That suggests that after hydrogenation, both X and Y's components become the same substance Z.

Hydrogenation of alkenes would add H
