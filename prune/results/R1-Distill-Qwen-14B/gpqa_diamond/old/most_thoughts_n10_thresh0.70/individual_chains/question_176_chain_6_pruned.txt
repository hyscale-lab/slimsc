Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it step by step. 

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, hold on, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, wait, maybe it's given, but I have to normalize it first. Oh but wait, the question is about probabilities after measurements, so perhaps I need to normalize it. Let me think.

Wait, the state vector is a column matrix, but the elements are (-1, 2, 1). The length (squared) is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the state vector is |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Because in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized, so I think that's what we need to do here.

Next, the operators for observables P and Q are given. Let me write them down. 

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait a minute, Q looks like a diagonal matrix. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.
