Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and some formula involving the lattice parameters.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or maybe they're a separate category. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system. So the unit cell has all sides equal, but the angles between them are not 90 degrees, which is what makes it different from a cubic system. In this case, all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. That's quite a sharp angle.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length of the unit cell. So each edge of the rhombohedron is 10 Angstroms. Because a rhombohedral unit cell has all edges equal. So a = 10 A here.

The interplanar distance for a given plane (hkl) is calculated using the formula: d = a / sqrt( (
