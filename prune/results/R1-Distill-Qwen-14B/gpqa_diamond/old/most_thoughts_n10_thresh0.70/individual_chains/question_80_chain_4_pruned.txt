Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what the algorithm does to the input DNA sequences to produce the given outputs. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I need to find out what value ACAGTGACC gives based on the same algorithm.

Hmm, let me think. DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. So each position in the string is one of these four. Maybe the algorithm is converting each base into a number and then summing or doing something else with those numbers.

Looking at the first example: AGG. So the bases are A, G, G. Let's see what numbers these might correspond to. A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's based on their position in the alphabet. A is the first letter, so A=1; T is the 20th letter, but wait that's if we go by the whole alphabet. Wait, no, because in the DNA context, they might not be using the entire alphabet. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: maybe each nucleotide is being converted to its position in the DNA nucleotide order. Like, A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me check if that works with the first example.

AGG would be A (1), G (4), G (4). Summing them: 1 +4 +4=9. But the output is 115. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe it's not a simple sum.

Wait, maybe each base is converted into a number, and then the entire string is treated as a base-5 number or something else. Let's see.

Wait, another idea: perhaps each base is being assigned a value, and then the entire string is converted into a decimal number by treating each base's value as a digit in a certain base. For example, if we consider each base as a digit in base 5 (since there are 5 possible digits: 0,1,2,3,4, but wait, the bases are 4, but if A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4, then for base 5, each digit would be 1-4. But how would that translate
