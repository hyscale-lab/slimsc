Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and whether certain stars are detectable. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is used for high-precision spectroscopy, probably for exoplanet studies or stellar velocities. Let me think about what factors determine if a star is detectable by it.

The question says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out the S/N for each star and see if it meets this condition.

First, I should probably find out what ESPRESSO's capabilities are. From what I recall, ESPRESSO is a very high-resolution spectrograph. It's mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. The VLT has four 8.2-meter telescopes, so when ESPRESSO is coupled with one, it must have a certain collecting area and thus a certain sensitivity.

Wait, I think I read that ESPRESSO can achieve a high S/N ratio for bright stars. But for dimmer stars, the S/N drops. So the key here is the brightness of each star as seen from Earth, which depends on their distance and intrinsic brightness.

The stars in the options vary in distance and, possibly, absolute magnitude. Let's look at each option:

a) Canopus: I think that's a very bright star. Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, so its apparent magnitude must be very low, like around -0.7 or something. That should be easily detectable because it's bright.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star, right? I remember it's not the brightest, but it's quite visible. Its apparent magnitude is about 1.97. So it's not as bright as Canopus but still pretty bright. So likely detectable.

c) Star with RA and DEC at 0, absolute V mag 15, 10 pc away. Wait, absolute magnitude is how bright it is intrinsically, but apparent magnitude depends on distance. The formula I remember is m = M + 5 + 5 log10 (d), where d is distance in parsecs. So for M=15, d=10 pc: m = 15 +5 +5*log(10) â†’ log(10)=1, so 15+5+5=25. So apparent magnitude 25 is very faint. Wait, but higher magnitudes are dimmer. So this star would be too dim for ESPRESSO to get an S/N of 10 in 1 hour. So probably not detectable.

d) Same as c but distance 200 pc. Let me compute m: M=15, d=200. So m =15 +5 +5 log10(
