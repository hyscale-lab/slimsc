Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics question here. It's about matrices and their properties, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's see... Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices are used to represent observables, operators, and other things like the evolution operator. 

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are four statements, A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

Let me go through each option one by one. But first, maybe I should recall some important properties about these matrices.

Quantum mechanics matrices: Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. The exponential of a Hermitian matrix is unitary, I think. Also, the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary as well. 

Wait, so for an operator U to be unitary, U† U = I, where † is the conjugate transpose.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. So the question is about e^X acting on a vector. The norm changes only if e^X is not unitary, right? Because unitary operators preserve the norm.

So, is e^X unitary? Well, for e^X to be unitary, X must be anti-Hermitian, because the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Alternatively, if X is Hermitian, e^X is not necessarily unitary. Wait, wait. Let me think again. 

Wait, Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues, and their exponentials are positive definite but not necessarily unitary. Anti-Hermitian matrices (which are like i times Hermitian) have exponentials that are unitary.

So, I should check if X is Hermitian or anti-Hermitian.

Matrix X is given as:

X = [i, -1, 2i;
     1, 0, 1;
     2i, -1, -i]

Wait, to check if X is Hermitian, X must equal X†. Let's compute X†.

X† is the conjugate transpose. So, the first row of X becomes the first column of X†, each element conjugated.

First row of X is [i, -1, 2i]. Conjugate is [-i, -1, -2i]. So first column of X† is [-i, 1, 2i]^T? Wait, wait, let me compute each element.

Compute X†:

Original X:
Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [2i, -1, -i]

Conjugate each element:

Row 1: [-i, -1, -2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [-2i, -1, i]

Transpose the matrix (swap rows and columns):

So X† will be:

Column 1: [-i, 1, -2i]
Column 2: [-1, 0, -1]
Column 3: [-2i, 1, i]

Wait, so let's write X† as:

First row: [-i, -1, -2i]
Second row: [1, 0, 1]
Third row: [-2i, -1, i]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the transpose would mean that the first element of X's column becomes the row. Let me think in terms of positions.

X is:

Row 1: (0,0)=i; (0,1)=-1; (0,2)=2i
Row 2: (1,0)=1; (1,1)=0; (1,2)=1
Row 3
