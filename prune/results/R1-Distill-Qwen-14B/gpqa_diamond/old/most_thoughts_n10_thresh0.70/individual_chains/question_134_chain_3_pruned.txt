Okay, so I have this enthalpy of neutralization problem to solve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, the question gives me three different solutions to mix. Oh, right, they're all being mixed together.

The problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I need to be careful with units.

First, I think I need to figure out how much acid and base there are in terms of moles, because the enthalpy change depends on the amount of reaction.

Let me break it down step by step.

1. Calculate moles for each solution.

HCl is a strong acid. Its formula is HCl, so each mole gives one H+ ion. So moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a diprotic acid, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So for neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 can react with two moles of OH-.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since it's diprotic, the H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is barium hydroxide. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when mixing an acid and a base, the H+ from acids will react with OH- from bases. But wait, how much is each component contributing?

So total H+ from all acids: HCl gives 0.1 moles, H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles. So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles.

So when they react, the neutralization is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. The limiting reagent is the one with fewer moles, right?

So comparing 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-, OH- is the limiting reagent. So all the OH- will react, using up 0.2 moles of H+.

So the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, and there will be leftover H+.

Wait, but the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization. I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases, but it's per mole of H+ and OH- reacting.

So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 57 kJ, but since it's exothermic, the enthalpy is negative.

But wait, in this case, how much H+ and OH- are reacting? It's 0.2 moles of each.

So the total
