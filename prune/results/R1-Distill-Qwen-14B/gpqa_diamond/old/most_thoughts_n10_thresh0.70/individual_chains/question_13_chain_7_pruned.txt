Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic system with two rings, I think a six-membered and a five-membered ring connected. Wait, no, Limonene is actually a bicyclic compound with a structure that's more like a fused cyclohexene and a cyclopentane or something like that. Maybe it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration.

The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Hydrogenation with Pd/C under hydrogen. So, the first step is hydrogenation. Since hydrogen is used, it's probably a hydrogenation of a double bond. Limonene has a double bond in its structure, so this would hydrogenate that, adding hydrogen across the double bond. But wait, limonene is a terpene, so maybe it's more like a bicyclic compound with an exo-methylene group or something. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, turning it into a single bond. Also, since it's stirred with Pd/C and under hydrogen, this is a catalytic hydrogenation, which typically adds hydrogen across double bonds in a syn addition. But wait, for the stereochemistry, since the starting material is (R) configuration, how does that affect the product?

Wait, after hydrogenation, product 1 is isolated as the major product. So the hydrogenation of (R)-limonene would form a hydrogenated compound. Let me think about the structure of limonene. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, a bicyclic structure, with a specific configuration. The (R) designation is for the specific enantiomer, which is the (+) levorotatory one. So when we hydrogenate limonene, the double bond (which is in a specific position) will be hydrogenated, adding H2 across it.

Now, limonene has two rings. Let me imagine the structure. Wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So the molecule has a norbornene structure. So when we hydrogenate this, the double
