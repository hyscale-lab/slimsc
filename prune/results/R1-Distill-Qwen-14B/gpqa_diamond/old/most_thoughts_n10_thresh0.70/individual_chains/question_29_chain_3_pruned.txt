Okay, so I've got this genetics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that unfortunately produces an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, and it has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then find which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The question shows the wild-type gene sequence and four mutant sequences. I need to look for which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function, thereby stopping the compound from being made.

So, the wild-type sequence is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: 
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild-type, let's see where the changes are. Let's line them up.

Wild-type starts: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

So, looking at the first part:

Wild: ...TTTCTCGC...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGC...

Wait, so positions after ATGTT? Let me count:

Wild: positions 5-10: TTT C T C G C
Mutant1: TCT ACG C...

Wait, maybe it's easier to note the exact differences. Let's compare each nucleotide.

The first line starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So, the first few nucleotides are:

Wild: ATG T TT C TC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG... etc.

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT AC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, looking at the wild type: after the start codon ATG, the next bases are TTTCTCGCTG...

In mutant 1, it's TTCTACGCTG...

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in the third, fourth, etc. nucleotides. Let me index:

Wild: positions 4-15: TTT C TC G C TGGTACTTCTGTG

Mutant1: positions 4-15: TCT A CG C TGGTACTTCTGTG

So, the change is at position where in wild-type it's T, and in mutant it's C, maybe? Or perhaps it's a substitution of T to C in a particular spot.

But wait, maybe I should look for where the substitution is. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for where the amino acid changes.

Wait, maybe I should think about what kind of mutations would disrupt the gene's function. The question is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, which suggests that the gene's product (the compound)
