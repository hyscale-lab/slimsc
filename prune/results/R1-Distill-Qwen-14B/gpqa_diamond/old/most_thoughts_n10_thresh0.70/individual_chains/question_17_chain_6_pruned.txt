Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly. 

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's 'stoichiometric' mean here? Oh right, it probably means that the Ca and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio in the complex. So for every mole of Ca, there's a mole of EDTA bound to it. 

The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, but I don't think that affects the calculation directly. The K value given is K_Ca-EDTA = 5x10^10. K here is the formation constant, right? The formation constant tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable because it favors the formation of the complex from its ions.

So, the formation constant K is given by the formula K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form in solution, and the exact form might depend on the pH. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about the protonation state of EDTA. That probably means we can proceed with the assumption that EDTA is in the correct form to bind Ca²+.

The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote [Ca-EDTA] as 0.02 M. That's the concentration of the complex formed. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA in solution should be related to this.

Wait, but dissociation. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the formation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ Ca-EDTA. So the formation constant K is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) =
