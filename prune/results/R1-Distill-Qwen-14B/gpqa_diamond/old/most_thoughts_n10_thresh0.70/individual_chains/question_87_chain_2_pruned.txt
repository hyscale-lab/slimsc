Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, no, a 6-membered aromatic ringâ€”so benzene? But wait, benzene is C6H6. This compound has 8 carbons in total? So, the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons because 6 (from benzene) plus 2 equals 8. But wait, wait, no. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, and if the compound has 8, then the substituents add 2 carbons. Or maybe it's a substituted benzene with groups that have more carbons.

Wait, let's think again. Benzene is C6. If the total is 8 carbons, that means the substituents contribute 2 carbons. So the molecule is C8H? Let me see: the formula for benzene is C6H6. If it's di-substituted, each substitution replaces an H. So if each substituent is a group like -X, which doesn't add any carbons, but
