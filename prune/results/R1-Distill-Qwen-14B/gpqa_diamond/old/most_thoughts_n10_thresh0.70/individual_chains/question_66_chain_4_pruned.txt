Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators. But wait, which symmetries must these operators respect?

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

I think about what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's about the invariance under Lorentz transformations and translations in space and time. Oh right, but in SMEFT, the operators are constructed from the Standard Model fields, so they should respect the same symmetries as the SM.

Wait, in the Standard Model, the gauge symmetry is SU(2) × U(1), but SMEFT adds higher-dimension terms. But the question is about symmetries that all operators must respect, regardless of which terms they are.

So, Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is an extension. So operator terms are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So option 1 must be correct.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Well, Poincaré includes both Lorentz and translations. But in a theory like SMEFT, the operators are local, but do they necessarily have to respect Poincaré symmetry? Wait, Poincaré symmetry implies that the theory is invariant under translations, which for a field theory would mean that the action is translationally invariant. But SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's usually considered to be valid up to some cutoff. But do the individual operators have to be Poincaré invariant?

Wait a second, Poincaré symmetry includes both the Lorentz group and the group of translations. Operators in SMEFT are built from local products of fields, covariant derivatives, etc. So the terms themselves would be local, hence respecting translations. So the entire theory (action) is Poincaré invariant. But the question is about which symmetries each operator must respect. Wait, but individual operators don
