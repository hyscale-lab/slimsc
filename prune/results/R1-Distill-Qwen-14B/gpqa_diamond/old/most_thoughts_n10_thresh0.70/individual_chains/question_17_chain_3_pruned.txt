Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, temperature is 25 degrees C, so I don't think I need to worry about those factors affecting the K value.

Wait, I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. Oh right, when EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+, the free calcium ions in solution are much less than the concentration of the complex itself because the formation constant is so large. The formation constant K is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2–. The K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So, if the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, that means [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But wait, what about the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? Since K is very large (5x10^10), the reaction heavily favors the product. So the concentrations of Ca²+ and free EDTA must be very low.

Let me think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is 1:1, so each mole of CaEDTA^2– comes from one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4–. But because the complex is much more stable, almost all of the Ca²+ and free EDTA will form the complex. So, the initial concentrations would be [Ca²+] = 0.02 M and [EDTA^4-] = 0.02 M before any complexation. But after the reaction, almost all of that forms the complex. So the [CaEDTA^2–] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4–] are each very small.

Wait, but the question gives
