Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem gives information about substances A1 to A5 and their reactions. My goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me list out what I know:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think this stands for the oxidation state of fluorine) is 31.96% for A2. Wait, oxidation state is usually a whole number, so maybe that's a percentage of something else? Hmm, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass? Or perhaps it's the oxidation number expressed as a fraction? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe "É·F" is the molar mass of fluorine in the compound. Wait, fluorine's atomic mass is about 19 g/mol, but 31.96% is close to 19/60 or something... Not sure yet. I'll have to come back to that.

2. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Since fluorine is involved, maybe A1 is a fluoride or a fluorine compound that's a strong oxidizer.

3. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y is another element that forms a binary compound with fluorine. Maybe Y is a halogen, like chlorine or something else? Or perhaps a metal?

4. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Hmm, so A5's decomposition products are probably Y and something else, maybe HF or another compound.

Wait, let's think about A4. Since adding Y (1:1) to A4 gives A5, which breaks down in water, perhaps A4 is a compound that reacts with Y to form something. Maybe A4 is a salt that when Y is added, it forms a different compound.

Let me consider possible elements Y and compounds they form with F. The question mentions five binary compounds, so element Y probably forms multiple fluorides.

Fluorine usually has -1 oxidation state, but in some compounds, it can be in higher states. Let's think about possible Y elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, chlorine forms ClF, Cl
