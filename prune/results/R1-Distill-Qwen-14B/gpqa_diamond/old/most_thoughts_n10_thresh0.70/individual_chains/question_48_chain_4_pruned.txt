Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we're starting with cyclohexanone and going through a series of reactions to get to product 4. The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. I need to figure out what each reaction does and then determine the structure of product 4.

First, the initial compound is cyclohexanone. That's a six-membered ring with one ketone group. The first reaction is treatment with bromine. Wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, and when you add bromine to a ketone... Oh, right! That's the bromination of the carbonyl group. In the presence of HBr, I think the ketone can undergo an addition reaction. But wait, bromine in what conditions? Oh wait, when ketones react with bromine, especially in a non-polar solvent, it might undergo a different kind of addition. Wait, no, I think when you add bromine to a ketone, it's a typical addition-elimination reaction. Oh wait no, maybe it's a diaddition? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh right! When a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br2), it undergoes a 1,2-addition. The carbonyl oxygen is attacked by Br-, but wait, maybe it's a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone plus bromine might lead to the formation
