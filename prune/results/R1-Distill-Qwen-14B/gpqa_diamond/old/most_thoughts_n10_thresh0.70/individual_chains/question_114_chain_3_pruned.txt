Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for the given reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, looking at the reactions given:

1. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So, the cyanide ion (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, I think that in some cases, especially with certain conditions, the product can be an alcohol after some work-up. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, right! When you add HCN to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN â†’ cyanohydrin. But here, the reagent is NaCN. So maybe it's the same as adding HCN, because NaCN in an acidic solution would provide HCN. Because CN- is a weak base, so in acidic conditions, it can protonate to form HCN.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and a reagent A would probably be under acidic conditions. So, A might be H3O+ (acid, like H2SO4 or HCl, but in the options, H3O+ is an option). So, the reaction produces a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, the formula doesn't seem right. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When HCN adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, no. Let me draw it. The ketone is (CH3)2CO. HCN adds to the carbonyl, so the product would have the CN group and the OH on the same carbon. So the product would be (CH
