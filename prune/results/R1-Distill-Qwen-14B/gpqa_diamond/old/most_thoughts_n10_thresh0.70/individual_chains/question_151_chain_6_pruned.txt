Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about finding the probability that a measurement of a certain observable will yield 0. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by the matrix operator P, which has specific elements in each row.

Wait, I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, and the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that matrix. The probabilities are calculated based on the state vector and the eigenvectors corresponding to those eigenvalues.

So, the first thing I need to do is find the eigenvalues of matrix P because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. Then, I can check which eigenvalue is 0 because the question is about the probability of getting 0.

Let me look at the matrix P again. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So it's a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, maybe I should write it down to visualize better:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let's compute the determinant of (P - λI). The matrix P-λI will have elements where the diagonal elements are each subtracted by λ.

So, the matrix becomes:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. Let me write out the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, maybe I should expand along the first row to make it easier.

The determinant expansion along the first row would be:

(-λ) * det(minor of P11) - (1/√2) * det(minor of P12) + 0 * det(minor of P13)

So, minor of P11 is the 2x2 matrix:
[ [-λ, 1/√2],
  [1/√2, -λ] ]

Minor of P12 is:
[ [1/√2, 1/√2],
  [0, -λ] ]

So, determinant becomes:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 

Let me compute each part.

First term:
(-λ) * [ λ² - (1/2) ] → because (1/√2)^2 is 1/2.

Second term:
- (1/√2) * [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] → which is - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ/2)

So putting it all together:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/ 2 )

Expanding the first part:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2)

So combining the terms: -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2 ) = -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Wait, that's the same as λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0. So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, and λ = ±1.

Oh, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

But wait, in the context of observables, the eigenvalues are real, which makes sense because P is Hermitian. So 0 is one of the possible outcomes.

Now, the state vector is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Let's call this vector ψ. But wait, I should check if ψ is normalized. The norm would
