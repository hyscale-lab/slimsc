Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem where I have to pick the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me think this through step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, using reagent A, to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide (like NaCN) typically undergo a nucleophilic substitution or maybe addition. Wait, but ketones don't usually do SN2 because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, making the alpha carbon less likely for substitution. Oh wait, maybe it's a specific reaction. Oh right! The formation of cyanohydrins. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, like from NaCN, in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. That's right. The mechanism involves the acid protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and water leaves, forming the cyanohydrin.

So for the first reaction, reagent A must be an acid because the acid is necessary to protonate the carbonyl. Looking at the options, the options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh, wait, I think NaHSO3 is used when you want a milder acid or when maybe the solution needs to be more buffered. Or wait, perhaps for the second reaction?

Wait, the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the reagent A is likely an acid. So the options have A as either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, but NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. Wait, no, actually, I think bisulfite is HSO3^-, so the solution is acidic because HSO3^- can donate a proton. So NaHSO3 would provide H+ but in a less strong way than H3O+.

Wait,
