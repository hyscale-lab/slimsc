Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, Planet3. They're in a system with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method (which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation; not sure if that's relevant here though). The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Also, their albedos are all 0.3, same as Earth's. I need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

Let me jot down the given ratios:

- T1 (Planet1) / T2 (Planet2) ≈ 1.4 → So T1 is hotter than T2? Wait no, equilibrium temperature is higher when closer to the star. Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance, right? Because the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ D^2))^(1/4), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of T proportional to (L / D^2)^(1/4). But since the star's luminosity (L) is the same for all three planets, the temperature ratio depends on the orbital distance D.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = (L * (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²))^(1/4), where a is the albedo. Since all albedos are equal (0.3), the a term is the same for all, so T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). So T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(D).

Wait, no: Let me get this right. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = [ (L (1-A) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So here, L is the star's luminosity, which is the same for all three. A is the albedo, same for all (0.3). So T_eq is proportional to 1 / sqrt(D), because 1/D² inside the 1/4 power becomes 1/D^(1/2).

So the ratio of T1 to T2 is 1.4. Let me write that as T1 / T2 = 1.4. Since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), then T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2 / D1). Because T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 =k / sqrt(D2), so T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) =1.4 → so D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 → D2 = D1 * (1.96). So D2 is 1.96 times D1. So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

Wait, but that can't be right because higher temperature would imply closer orbit. Oh
