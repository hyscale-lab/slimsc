Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is about calculating the probability of measuring a particular observable, P, and getting the value 0. 

So, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the state is usually represented as a vector in a Hilbert space, probably a 3-dimensional space since the matrix P is 3x3. But wait, I should check whether this state is normalized. Because probabilities depend on the state being normalized.

The state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). To normalize it, I need to calculate the norm squared, which is the sum of the squares of each component. So, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up: 1 + 4 +1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state would be this vector divided by sqrt(6). Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically normalized to 1.

Wait, but when calculating probabilities, sometimes you can proceed without normalizing if you're careful, but I think it's better to normalize first. So, let me write the state as a column vector. Let me denote it as ψ:

ψ = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Then, the observable P is given by a matrix. Let me write that out. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix.

So, P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, I think this is a Hermitian matrix because for an observable, the matrix must be Hermitian. Let me check
