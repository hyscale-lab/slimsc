Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in terms of parallax. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Parallax, plx, is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, if I consider a thin shell at a certain distance, the number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume, right? Because the more volume you have, the more stars you can fit, assuming they're uniformly distributed.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, so the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume itself. Now, what's the volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with a thickness corresponding to a small change in plx?

I need to relate plx to distance. Plx p = 1/d (in parsecs). So d = 1/p. The volume of a shell is 4πd² * Δd, where Δd is the change in distance. But since we're looking at a change in parallax, I should express this in terms of p.

Wait, since p = 1/d, then Δp would be the change in parallax. Let's see, if d increases by Δd, then p changes by Δp. Let me compute Δp in terms of Δd. Since p = 1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, Δp ≈ -(1/d²) Δd. But since we're considering a small change, Δp is about -(1/d²) Δd. However, when I think about the number of stars per unit parallax, I might need to relate the volume as a function of p.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of p. So, d = 1/p. The volume of a thin shell at distance d is 4πd² * Δd. But Δd can be expressed in terms of Δp. Since d = 1/p, Δd = - (1/p²) Δp. Wait, the negative here indicates that as p decreases, d increases, but since we're dealing with small intervals, maybe I can
