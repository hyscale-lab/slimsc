Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence will give me the desired product with high yield.

First, I'll try to break down the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro group and a bromine. The nitro is at the 5 position, and the bromo at the 3 position. Also, attached to the ring is an ethan-1-one group, which is an acetyl group (CH3CO-) attached to the benzene. So, the acetyl is in the 1 position relative to the substituents.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the numbering. In benzene derivatives, the numbering starts such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. So, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group. So, the acetyl is in position 1, then the nitro is in position 5 (para to acetyl?), and bromo in position 3 (meta to acetyl? Hmm, maybe I should visualize this.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so when you have substituents at 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetyl at position 1, that would place the nitro in position 5 and bromo in 3. So, the substituents are at 3 and 5, meaning they are meta to each other. So the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at 5, bromo at 3. So, the positions are 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). That makes sense because 3 and 5 are meta to each other.

Now, how do we get substituents in such positions starting from benzene? The problem is about the sequence of reactions. Let me think about the reactions.

Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. The order of adding substituents matters because each substituent can direct the next substitution. Nitro groups are meta-directing, and bromine is ortho/para, but wait, wait—wait, but wait, in this case, the substituents are a nitro and a bromine. But wait, in the target molecule, the bromine is at position 3, nitro at 5. So, perhaps the substituents are added in a certain order, and each directs the next substitution.

Wait, but we also have the acetyl group. Wait, the acetyl is an electron-withdrawing group because it's an carbonyl. It's a meta-directing group. So, once we have that, any new substituents will enter meta to it.

So, let's think about the steps: we start with benzene. We need to add substituents in a way that gives us the nitro and bromine in the correct positions relative to the acetyl group.

But wait, wait. The target molecule has the acetyl group (O=C-CH3) attached to the benzene, plus nitro and bromine substituents. So the acetyl is a substituent as well. So the order of addition of substituents must be such that the acetyl is added first or last? Because the directing effects will change depending on which substituent is present.

Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts acylation, the acetyl group is added to benzene. But wait, benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone (phenyl ketone). So, if we first add the acetyl group, then that would be our first step.

If we add the acetyl group first, then the next substituents (Br and NO2) would be directed by the acetyl group, which is meta-directing. So, the next substituent would go meta to the acetyl. But wait, we have two substituents: a Br and a nitro group. So, perhaps the order in which they are added matters.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, which is a meta-directing group, then the acetyl is added, but then where would it go? Or maybe the nitro group is added after the acetyl.

Wait, alternatively, if I'm making this molecule, perhaps the correct approach is to introduce the nitro and bromine substituents in a way that they are both meta to the acetyl. Because the acetyl is the main substituent, so it will have a strong directing effect.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 5 and bromo at 3, both meta to the acetyl at position 1. So, each substituent is meta to the acetyl. So, if the acetyl is the first substituent, then the next substituents would enter meta to it.

So, after adding the acetyl, the next substituent added (say, nitro) would go meta to it, which would be position 3 or 5. Then, if we add bromine next, it would also go meta to the acetyl, but maybe in another position.

Wait, but wait, when you have multiple substituents, the directing effect depends on their positions, and which substituents are present. So, perhaps the order of substitution is crucial.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible reaction sequences in the options and see which one could lead to the desired product.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination) → iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration) → iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?) → v) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?) → vi) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?) → vii) H3PO2 (what's that? Maybe a reducing agent, like for diazonium salts.)

Wait, but let's think about the steps. Starting with benzene, first acetylation gives acetophenone. Then bromination (FeBr3) would add Br in the meta position (since acetyl is meta-directing). So, after bromination, we have 3-bromoacetophenone.

Next is nitration. Acetophenone has the acetyl group, which is meta-directing. So nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to acetyl, which is position 5 (since position 3 is already occupied by Br). So, after nitration, the product would have Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, but wait: the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that's the same as 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. So after step ii (bromination), the product is 3-bromoacetophenone. Then step iii: nitration would add nitro at position 5. So, after iii, the product is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. So that's our desired product. But the steps continue, so steps iv and beyond must not be necessary, but perhaps we're missing something.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option has seven steps. So option A has steps i to vii, which might not all be needed. But perhaps the steps are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the substituent directing. So after adding acetyl (step i), bromination (step ii) adds Br at meta, so position 3. Then nitration (step iii) would add nitro at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl. So after step iii, we have the target. But then why are there more steps? So perhaps the given options are longer sequences beyond what's needed, but the problem states that the options are the sequences to choose from.

Wait, but perhaps some steps are not needed or could be causing issues. For example, after getting the desired product, some steps would lead to degradation or incorrect products. So perhaps the correct option is the one that gets the substituents in the right positions without introducing unwanted groups.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: i) AcCl/AlCl3 → ii) Br2/FeBr3 → iii) HNO3 → iv) Fe/HCl → v) HNO3 → vi) NaNO2/HCl → vii) H3PO2.

Wait, after step iii, we have the target, right? So steps iv to vii might be superfluous or maybe incorrect. For example, Fe/HCl is a reducing condition. Maybe after nitration, they're doing something else. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration is done in a way that doesn't directly give the desired product, and further steps are needed. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → ii) HNO3 → iii) AcCl/AlCl3 → iv) HNO3 → v) Fe/HCl → vi) NaNO2/HCl → vii) H3PO2.

Wait, starting with benzene, first bromination: that introduces a Br substituent. Then nitration: nitro group would enter in a position directed by Br. Br is ortho/para directing. So nitration would add nitro either ortho or para to Br.

Then, step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, benzene with Br and nitro groups. Wait, but if we have Br and nitro, which are both meta to each other, then adding an acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene with Br and nitro groups would be deactivated. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Br is deactivating (but o/p-directing). So when multiple substituents are present, the most activating group directs. But in this case, nitro is more deactivating than Br. So the acetylation may not proceed, or may proceed under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's impossible because the ring is too deactivated.

If Friedel-Crafts can't be done, that would be a problem. So maybe option B is incorrect because after steps i and ii, the ring is too deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts acylation impossible. So option B might not be feasible.

Option C: i) HNO3 → ii) Fe/HCl → iii) AcCl/AlCl3 → iv) Br2/FeBr3 → v) HNO3 → vi) NaNO2/HCl → vii) H3PO2.

Start with nitration. Benzene with HNO3 gives nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl: that's a reducing condition. Nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenyl amine (aniline). But wait, HCl and Fe is a typical reduction of nitro groups to amines. So step ii would produce aniline.

Then step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation. Aniline is a strong activating group (NH2 is strong activating, ortho/para-directing). So acetylation would add acetyl in the para position relative to NH2. So after step iii, we have acetanilide (phenylacetamide?), but wait, Friedel-Crafts adds the acetyl group to the ring, so the structure would be acetophenone derivative? Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acetyl group to benzene. So if the ring already has an NH2 group, the acetyl would be added in the para position to NH2.

Wait, but after step ii, we have aniline (NH2 at position 1). Then step iii: acetylation would add acetyl at position 4 (para) relative to NH2.

Then step iv: Br2/FeBr3. Now, the ring has NH2 (position 1), acetyl (position 4), and Br to be added. Wait, but in aniline, the NH2 is a strong activating group, so Br would add meta to it. Or wait, NH2 is ortho/para directing. So the Br would add either ortho or para to NH2.

But in this case, the ring already has substituents. Let me think: positions 1 (NH2), 4 (acetyl). So when adding Br, it would go ortho or para to NH2. Para is position 4, which is already taken by acetyl. So Br would go to ortho positions relative to NH2, which are positions 2 and 6. But where would it go in the presence of the acetyl group at position 4.

Alternatively, the acetyl group is at position 4, so the ring looks like:

Positions: 1 (NH2), 4 (acetyl). When adding Br, the directing groups are the NH2 and acetyl. NH2 is more activating, so it would direct the Br substitution.

So Br would be added either at position 2 or 6 (ortho to NH2). So after step iv, Br is at 2 or 6.

Then step v: HNO3/H2SO4. Nitration. Now, we have substituents at 1 (NH2), 4 (acetyl), and 2 or 6 (Br). Nitration is directed by the substituents. NH2 is activating, so nitration would occur ortho or para to NH2. But para is position 4 (acetyl). So the nitration would go ortho to NH2, which is position 2 or 6. But Br is already there. So perhaps position 3 or 5? Wait, perhaps the substituents have a combined effect. Alternatively, it's getting complicated, and maybe this sequence isn't leading us to the correct product.

Additionally, after step v, we have another nitration. The target has only one nitro group. So this might be adding another nitro, which isn't desired. So option C is probably not correct.

Option D: i) HNO3 → ii) Fe/HCl → iii) NaNO2/HCl → iv) H3PO2 → v) Br2/FeBr3 → vi) AcCl/AlCl3 → vii) HNO3.

Let's see. Starting with benzene, step i: nitration gives nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl reduces nitro to NH2, giving aniline. Step iii: NaNO2/HCl is for diazotization, but without a strong base. Wait, diazotization typically occurs under cold (0-5°C) conditions with NaNO2 and HCl. Then step iv: H3PO2 is a reducing agent, perhaps to do something with the diazonium salt. Wait, H3PO2 is used as a mild reducing agent. After diazotization, H3PO2 might reduce the diazonium group to an amine, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, but let's proceed. Step v: Br2/FeBr3. After step iv, perhaps the ring has some substituents. Let's think: after step ii, we have aniline (NH2). Step iii: diazotization converts NH2 to diazonium chloride. Then step iv: H3PO2 might reduce the diazonium salt to something. Wait, but H3PO2 is sometimes used in the Sandmeyer reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) Nitration: nitro group added at position 1.

ii) Reduction: nitro → NH2.

iii) Diazotization (with NaNO2 and HCl): converts NH2 to diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2: perhaps a reduction of the diazonium salt to a phenol? Or maybe a substitution reaction.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. After step ii, we have aniline (NH2). Step iii: diazotization forms the diazonium salt. Step iv: H3PO2 is used, maybe for a coupling reaction or for reduction. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to introduce a bromine via a substitution.

Wait, but the target has bromine at position 3 and nitro at 5 relative to acetyl. Hmm, perhaps this route isn't leading to the correct substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps after step iv, the NH2 group is replaced with Br. Because diazonium salts can undergo substitution with Br- in the presence of a copper catalyst (like in the Sandmeyer reaction). But without Cu, maybe it's tricky. So perhaps step iv is a way to substitute the diazonium group with Br.

So step iv: H3PO2. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H3PO2 is used to reduce the diazonium salt to a benzene ring with a bromine substitution. Or maybe it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps in step iv, the diazonium group is treated with H3PO2 to form a hydroxyl group. But that would give a phenol, which is activating.

But in this case, perhaps after step iv, the substituent is a hydroxyl group. Then step v: Br2/FeBr3 would add Br in a position directed by the phenol group. Phenol is activating and ortho/para directing. So Br would add at ortho or para positions relative to the phenol.

Then step vi: AcCl/AlCl3. Friedel-Crafts acylation. If the substituents are in certain positions, the acetyl group would add in a certain position.

Then step vii: nitration again. But the target has only one nitro group, so this might not fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which one logically builds the substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, the target has three substituents: acetyl, Br, and nitro. Wait, no, no—wait, benzene has three substituents? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring has two substituents: Br at position 3 and nitro at position 5, and the acetyl group is attached to the benzene at position 1. So the benzene ring has three substituents: acetyl (position 1), Br (3), nitro (5). Wait, but that's not possible because in benzene, each substituent is attached to a carbon, but with three substituents, their positions would be 1,3,5, which are all meta to each other. So, the benzene ring would have substituents at 1,3,5.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me check: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

The ethan-1-one group is -(C=O)CH3 attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene is attached to CH3CO- at position 1. Then, the benzene has substituents at position 3 (Br) and position 5 (NO2). So the three substituents are at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, all three substituents are meta to each other. So, the acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

So, the ring has three substituents, each at 1,3,5 positions. So, in the synthesis, we need to introduce three substituents in the correct order and positions.

Now, to get substituents at 1,3,5, perhaps we can first add the acetyl group, then the nitro, then the bromine. Or another order.

Wait, but benzene can only have one substituent at a time via electrophilic substitution. So the order of adding substituents is crucial.

So, let's think about the correct order. Let's say we start by adding the acetyl group (Friedel-Crafts). Then, the next substituent would be directed by the acetyl group.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 5, Br at 3. So if the acetyl is at position 1, then nitro at 5 is meta to acetyl, and Br at 3 is also meta to acetyl. So both substituents are meta to the acetyl.

But wait, can both substituents be introduced via meta direction from the acetyl group? That would require that after adding the acetyl, both nitration and bromination happen in the meta positions relative to it.

But when you add multiple substituents, the positions are influenced by all existing substituents. So, after adding acetyl, if you nitrate, the nitro group would go to the meta position (position 5). Then, if you brominate, where would the Br go?

After acetyl (position 1) and nitro (position 5), the Br would be added in a position directed by both the acetyl and nitro groups.

But the acetyl is meta-directing, and the nitro is also meta-directing. So, the possible positions for Br would be ortho to acetyl and meta to nitro, or something like that. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of existing substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the correct order is to add the bromine first, then the acetyl, then the nitro.

Wait, let me think again. The target has Br at position 3, nitro at 5, and acetyl at 1. So perhaps adding the acetyl first. Then, the next substituent (nitro) would go meta to acetyl, which is position 5. Then, the bromine would go meta to acetyl, which is position 3. So that would place Br at 3.

But after adding nitro at 5, the next substitution (Br) would be directed by both the acetyl and nitro groups. Wait, but the acetyl is at 1, nitro at 5. The Br would be directed by the acetyl to be meta (position 3) and by the nitro to be meta (position 3, since nitro is at 5, meta would be position 1, but that's already taken by acetyl. So perhaps the Br would end up at position 3.

So the sequence of substituents would be acetyl → nitro → Br.

But that brings me to the reaction steps. So, after acetylation, nitration, then bromination.

Now, looking at the options again, which option does this?

Looking at option A: steps are i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration, etc.

Wait, option A: steps i to iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So after acylation (position 1), bromination would add Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl). Then nitration would add nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl). So after step iii, the product would have acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5), which is our target. Then why are there more steps? Steps iv to vii in option A would perhaps modify the structure, but in this case, the product is already achieved after step iii.

But are the remaining steps in option A leading to any changes? Let me see.

Step iv: Fe/HCl. That's a reducing condition. Fe and HCl is typically used to reduce nitro groups to amines. But if our target has a nitro group, then step iv would remove it by reducing to NH2. But in our target, we have nitro, not NH2. So step iv would be a problem because it would convert nitro to amine, which is not desired. So option A's steps would not be correct because after step iii, step iv would ruin the nitro group.

So option A is incorrect.

Looking at option B: steps i) Br, ii) nitro, iii) acylation, etc. As discussed earlier, after nitration and bromination, the ring might be too deactivated for Friedel-Crafts acylation to occur. So option B is unlikely.

Option C: steps i) nitro, ii) reduce to NH2, iii) acylation, iv) Br, v) nitro again. After acylation, we have acetyl at position 4 (relative to NH2 at position 1). Then adding Br would go ortho to NH2, which is position 2 or 6. Then, nitrating again would add nitro in another position, which is not desired because the target has only one nitro group. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: steps i) nitro, ii) reduce to NH2, iii) diazo, iv) H3PO2, v) Br, vi) acylation, vii) nitro. Hmm. Let me see.

i) Nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduced to NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazotization to form diazonium chloride at 1.

iv) H3PO2: I'm not entirely sure what this does. Maybe it's a way to replace the diazonium group with something else, like Br. For example, using H3PO2 typically provides a reducing environment. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of H3PO2, the diazonium group is converted to a hydroxyl group, but then step v is Br2/FeBr3, which would add Br in positions directed by the hydroxyl group (activating, o/p).

But let's proceed step by step.

After step ii, we have aniline (NH2 at 1). Step iii: diazotization → diazonium chloride at 1.

Step iv: H3PO2. Maybe this is a way to perform a Sandmeyer-type reaction. Wait, the Sandmeyer reaction replaces the diazonium group with a halide (like Br) using CuBr. But in the absence of Cu, perhaps H3PO2 isn't facilitating that. Alternatively, maybe it's a replacement reaction without Cu.

Alternatively, maybe step iv is a hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to give a phenol. So, after step iv, we have a phenol (OH at 1).

Then step v: Br2/FeBr3. Phenol is strongly activating (o/p-directing). So Br would add in ortho or para positions relative to OH.

If the OH is at 1, then para would be position 4, ortho would be positions 2 and 6. So Br would be added at, say, position 3 (meta to something else? Hmm, perhaps position 3 is meta to the OH at 1, but no, phenol directs o and p).

Wait, no, for phenol, the OH is at position 1. So Br would be added at positions 2, 4, or 6.

Then step vi: AcCl/AlCl3 → acylation. The ring now has OH (position 1) and Br (position 3 or 2 or 6). The acylation would be directed by the activating groups. OH is strongly activating, so acylation would occur ortho or para to it. But the para position (4) is available if Br is at 2 or 6.

Wait, if Br is at position 3, which is meta to the OH at 1, but that's not o/p. Wait, no, if the OH is at 1, then Br at 3 is meta to it. So benzene would have OH at 1, Br at 3. Then, when we acylate, the acetyl would go either ortho or para to OH.

Ortho to OH would be positions 2 and 6. Para is position 4.

So acetyl could be added at position 4. Now, the substituents are OH (1), Br (3), acetyl (4). Then step vii: HNO3/H2SO4. Nitration would occur, directed by the substituents.

But acetyl is a meta director, Br is ortho/para, and OH is ortho/para. So, where would the nitro group go?

Alternatively, perhaps this sequence doesn't lead to the correct substituent positions.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct sequence is option B. Wait, earlier I thought option B might have issues because after nitration and bromination, the ring is deactivated, making acylation difficult. But perhaps it's possible to acylate under certain conditions.

Wait, let me reconsider option B:

Option B: i) Br, ii) nitro, iii) acylation, iv) nitro, v) Fe/HCl, vi) NaNO2, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, starting with benzene. Step i: bromination → bromobenzene. Step ii: nitration → nitro group added either ortho or para to Br. So product is either o-nitro-bromobenzene or p-nitro-bromobenzene. Let's assume it's para.

Then step iii: acylation. But now the ring has Br and nitro groups. Both are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts acylation may not proceed. So option B might not work because acylation is difficult under these conditions.

So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's think about the possibility of using a directing group strategy. The acetyl group is meta-directing. So if I first introduce the acetyl group, then introduce the nitro and bromine groups in the correct positions.

So the correct order would be: acylation → nitration → bromination.

Looking for which option follows this order.

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. But that would lead to the Br being added before nitration. But if we nitrate after bromination, perhaps the positions would be affected. Let me think.

After acylation (step i), the ring has acetyl at position 1. Step ii: bromination adds Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl). Now, ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Step iii: nitration would be directed by acetyl and Br. Acetyl is meta-directing, Br is ortho/para. So the nitro would go where?

The acetyl directs meta (positions 3,5), but Br is at 3, which is meta to acetyl. So, for nitration, the possible positions are directed by both substituents. Acetyl would want nitro at 5, and Br would want nitro at 1 (acetyl's position) or 5. Since position 5 is meta to both, perhaps it's where the nitro goes. So after step iii, we have acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5), which is the target.

So, option A's steps would give the correct product after step iii, but then steps iv to vii would do something else. So, why are steps iv to vii present?

Looking at option A's steps after iii:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → perhaps reduce the diazonium to something.

So, this sequence would ruin the nitro group and add more substituents, which is not desired. So option A is incorrect.

Looking back at the options, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's not possible. Perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acylation, nitration, bromination. Let's see if any option follows that.

Looking at the options again.

Option B: steps are Br, nitro, acylation. So no.

Option C: steps are nitro, reduce, acylation, Br, nitro. No.

Option D: steps are nitro, reduce, diazo, H3PO2, Br, acylation, nitro. No.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the correct order is nitro → bromo → acetyl.

Wait, but that would require the ring to have nitro and bromo substituents before acetylation. But Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Nitro is deactivating, so acylation might not occur.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the acetyl group is introduced after the nitro and bromo groups have been added. But that would require the ring to have activating groups to allow Friedel-Crafts acylation. So perhaps if we have an NH2 group, which is activating, we can acylate.

Wait, let me think about option D.

Option D: steps are i) nitro, ii) reduce, iii) diazo, iv) H3PO2, v) Br, vi) acylation, vii) nitro.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to NH2 at 1.

Step iii: diazo → diazonium at 1.

Step iv: H3PO2: could this be a reduction or perhaps a substitution? Maybe H3PO2 is used in the Stannous chloride reduction or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to introduce a Br.

Wait, perhaps after diazo, treating with H3PO2 could lead to substitution. But I'm not sure. Let's assume that step iv replaces the diazonium group with Br. So after step iv, Br is at position 1.

Then step v: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Now, the ring has Br at 1. So bromination would add another Br in o/p positions. But we're trying to get Br at position 3, so this might not help.

Alternatively, maybe step iv produces a different substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the product after step iv is a phenol, which is activating. Then step v: bromination adds Br in o/p positions, and step vi: acylation adds acetyl in o/p to phenol. But this doesn't seem to align with the target.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

The target has acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). The correct order of substitution should be acetyl → nitro → Br, or acetyl → Br → nitro. But I think acetyl first is better because it's a strong meta director.

Looking at the options, option A follows acetyl → Br → nitro. But after nitration, steps iv to vii would modify the product, making it incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct one because after several steps, the substituents end up in the right positions.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider that the target has three substituents, and the order must be such that each substitution is directed correctly.

Another approach: The acetyl group is a meta director. So, after adding acetyl, the next substituent (nitro) would go meta to it, which is position 5. Then, the bromine would go meta to acetyl, which is position 3.

So, the correct sequence would be acetylation → nitration → bromination.

Looking for an option that does this.

Looking at option A: acetylation (i), bromination (ii), nitration (iii). So after acetyl, Br is added, then nitro. But that would place Br at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So that would be the correct positions. But then, steps iv to vii in option A would alter the structure, making it incorrect.

Wait, but maybe the steps after iii in option A are unnecessary. Or perhaps I'm missing something about the steps.

Wait, let me look at option A's steps again:

i) CH3COCl → acetylation → acetophenone (1-acetyl).

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3 → nitration → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone (target achieved).

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So now, product is 3-bromo-5-aminoacetophenone.

v) HNO3 → nitrates again. But this would add another nitro, which is not desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine.

vii) H3PO2 → reduces the diazonium salt, possibly to a phenol or something else.

So, the steps after iii in option A would change the product, making it incorrect. Therefore, option A can't be the right answer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the steps. Maybe some steps are protective or work in a way that doesn't affect the substituents I want.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii are a way to remove a group. For example, after getting the target, perhaps some protecting groups are added and then removed. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are not all necessary, but the correct option is the one that includes the correct sequence within its steps. So perhaps the first three steps (i, ii, iii) in option A are correct, and the rest are irrelevant. But the question states that the sequence leads to the high-yield synthesis, so all steps must contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the steps. Let me think about each step in option A:

i) AcCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination at meta (position 3) → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3 → nitration at meta (position 5) → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone (target).

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → 3-bromo-5-aminophenylacetonitrile? Wait, no, acetophenone's structure is benzene with an acetyl group. So after reduction, the nitro becomes NH2, making it 3-bromo-5-aminophenylacetone.

v) HNO3 → nitration again, but the target has only one nitro group. So this would add another nitro group, which is incorrect.

So, option A's steps don't lead to the desired product because after step iii, steps iv and v change the substituents. So option A is incorrect.

Looking back, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, option B: steps are i) Br, ii) nitro, iii) acylation.

So, step i: Br added to benzene → bromobenzene.

Step ii: nitration → nitro group added either ortho or para to Br. Let's say para → p-nitro-bromobenzene.

Step iii: acylation → can't proceed because the ring is deactivated by both Br and nitro. So Friedel-Crafts acylation is not possible here. So option B's steps are invalid because acylation can't happen.

Thus, option B is incorrect.

Option C: steps are i) nitro, ii) reduce to NH2, iii) acylation, iv) Br, v) nitro again.

After step iii, acylation occurs. So the ring has NH2 and acetyl. But after acylation, the ring has acetyl and NH2, which may allow Br to be added ortho to acetyl. But this sequence adds another nitro group, which is not desired.

Option D: steps are nitro → reduce → diazo → H3PO2 → Br → acylation → nitro.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to NH2.

Step iii: diazo → diazonium at 1.

Step iv: H3PO2 → maybe replaces diazonium with Br → Br at 1.

Step v: bromination → Br added at o/p to Br → perhaps position 3.

Step vi: acylation → acetyl added at position 5 (meta to Br at 1).

Step vii: nitration → nitro at position 3? But position 3 is already taken by Br. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me try to think of the correct order again. The correct order must be acylation first, then nitration, then bromination. So, which option has this?

Looking at the options, I think none of them have this exact sequence except for option A, but it's followed by steps that ruin the product.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me think about the steps in option D again.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro at para (let's say position 1).

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to NH2 at 1.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazo at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → maybe replace diazo with Br → Br at 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → Br at 3 (ortho to position 1).

vi) AcCl/AlCl3 → acylation → acetyl at position 5 (meta to Br at 1 and Br at 3).

Wait, but no, the acylation would be directed by the substituents. Now, the ring has Br at 1 and 3. Br is ortho/para director. So, acylation would add acetyl at position 5 (meta to Br at 1, which is not possible because Br is at 1 and 3. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, after step iv, we have Br at 1. Step v: bromination adds another Br at position 3. Now, the ring has Br at 1 and 3. Then step vi: acylation. The acylation would be directed by the Br substituents. Both Br are ortho/para directors. So, the acetyl would add at position 5 (meta to Br at 1 and 3). Then, step vii: nitration would add nitro at position 5, which is already taken by acetyl. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the correct option based on elimination.

Given the analysis, the only option that seems to reach the target structure after the first three steps is option A, but the subsequent steps would alter the product. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the order of steps. Let me think about the correct sequence again.

The correct sequence should be:

1. AcCl/AlCl3 → acetylation (position 1).

2. HNO3 → nitration (position 5, meta to acetyl).

3. Br2/FeBr3 → bromination (position 3, meta to acetyl).

Which aligns with option A's steps i, iii, ii. Wait, no, option A's steps are i, ii, iii: acylate, brominate, nitrate.

Wait, but that's the opposite order. So after acylation (1), bromination (3), then nitration (5). So, step i: acetyl at 1. Step ii: Br at 3. Step iii: nitro at 5. So, after step iii, we have the target.

But option A continues with steps iv to vii, which would modify the product.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii are not relevant, and the correct answer is option A because the first three steps are correct.

But the question states that the correct sequence leads to the high-yield synthesis, implying that all steps are necessary. So perhaps I'm missing something about the later steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the later steps are to protect or modify other groups, but I'm not seeing it.

Given all this confusion, I think the correct answer is option B. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option B is incorrect because the acylation can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B, because the steps are Br, nitro, acylation, but that may not be possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Let me think again.

Option B: steps are Br → nitro → acylation.

So, after step i: Br at position 1.

Step ii: nitro group added at position 3 (meta to Br, which is para to position 5? Or wait, Br is at 1, nitro can go ortho or para, which are positions 2 or 4.

Wait, if nitro is added para to Br (position 4), then step iii: acylation would be directed by Br and nitro. Acetylation would need to occur at position 6 (ortho to Br at 1, but that's meta to nitro at 4). Alternatively, acetylation would be directed by Br (ortho/para) to Br. So, position 2 or 4. But 4 is taken by nitro, so acetylation would occur at position 2.

But that doesn't give the desired positions. So option B is incorrect.

In conclusion, I think the correct option is option A, despite the later steps possibly being incorrect. But perhaps the correct answer is option B because I'm missing some key point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The target is 1-acetyl-3-bromo-5-nitrobenzene.

In option A:

After step iii: 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone (target).

But option A's step iv is Fe/HCl, which would reduce the nitro group to an amine, which is not desired. So option A can't be correct.

So, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Let me think about the steps:

Option B: steps i) Br, ii) nitro, iii) acylation.

After step i: Br at position 1.

Step ii: nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to Br).

Now, ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 3.

Step iii: acylation. The ring has Br and nitro, both deactivating. So Friedel-Crafts acylation is not feasible. So option B is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Option C: steps i) nitro, ii) reduce to NH2, iii) acylation, iv) Br, v) nitro.

After step iii: acetyl is added at position 4 (relative to NH2 at 1).

Step iv: Br added at position 2 (ortho to NH2).

Step v: nitro added, perhaps at position 6 (ortho to NH2), but then it's in the wrong position.

So, after step v, the substituents would be at 1 (NH2), 4 (acetyl), 2 (Br), 6 (nitro). But that's not the target structure.

Hmm, I'm really confused now. I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the initial analysis, the correct order of substitution is acetyl → nitro → Br, which would be steps i, iii, ii in option A. But option A's steps have the bromine before nitration, which may not be correct.

Wait, wait. Oh, I see! Option A's steps are:

i) AcCl → acetyl at 1.

ii) Br2 → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3 → nitro at 5.

So, after step iii, we have the desired product. So the first three steps are correct, and the remaining steps are perhaps extra or not relevant.

But the question says "the sequence of reactions from the following options would lead to the high-yield synthesis." So perhaps the correct option is A, and the extra steps are not part of the correct path. Or perhaps the extra steps are a distractor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I can't see how.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Based on the analysis, option A's first three steps are correct for the target product. The remaining steps are incorrect, but perhaps the question expects us to choose the option where the correct steps are present, regardless of the rest. So, I'll conclude that option A is the correct answer.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has three substituents: an acetyl group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The order of substitution is critical, as each substituent directs subsequent substitutions. The acetyl group is meta-directing, so the bromine and nitro groups must be introduced meta to it. The bromine and nitro groups are also meta-directing, so their positions relative to each other must be carefully controlled.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).
3. **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group).
   - After these steps, the target molecule is formed: 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve reducing the nitro group to an amine, re-nitrating, diazotizing, and treating with H₃PO₂. These steps are unnecessary and would alter the desired product, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 3 (meta to bromine).
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group.
   - At this stage, the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation unlikely to proceed efficiently. This makes the sequence infeasible.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group at position 4 (para to the amine).
4. **Step iv**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 2 (ortho to the amine).
5. **Step v**: Nitration adds another nitro group.
   - The target molecule has only one nitro group, so this sequence is incorrect.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: H₃PO₂ reduces the diazonium salt, likely replacing it with bromine.
5. **Step v**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds another bromine.
6. **Step vi**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group.
7. **Step vii**: Nitration adds another nitro group.
   - The target molecule has only one nitro group, so this sequence is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions must introduce the acetyl group first, followed by bromination and nitration in the correct meta positions. Option A achieves the target molecule after the first three steps (i–iii). However, the subsequent steps (iv–vii) are unnecessary and would alter the product. Despite this, Option A is the only sequence that logically leads to the target molecule within the first three steps.
