Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and then try to figure out what each part is telling me.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. Also, the melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because water freezes at 273 K (which is 0°C), so 277 K would be about 4°C. So B is probably a solid that melts at near 4°C. What's a common substance that melts around there? Maybe something like ice, but that's 0°C. Wait, maybe something else. Hmm. I'll get back to that.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That's interesting. Since the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, I'm thinking maybe it's a molecule of a noble gas because noble gases are monoatomic, but wait, the problem says a molecule, implying it's diatomic or polyatomic. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think. The molecule's atoms each have equal protons and neutrons. So each atom has protons = neutrons. Which elements have that?

Looking at the periodic table, elements with equal protons and neutrons would have a mass number (protons + neutrons) equal to twice the atomic number. For example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But wait, the gas is produced when X and Y react. Let me think about common gases. Hmmm. Maybe CO₂? No, because the molecule would have more atoms. Wait, another thought: what about H₂O? No, because the molecule's atoms would have H (1 proton, 0 neutrons typically), so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe CH4, but again, the atoms don't fit.
