Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some specific compounds. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through them carefully.

The question is about two parts: part A and part B. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, part A is asking which compound does not show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, leading to different structural isomers. For example, in carbonyl compounds, tautomerism can occur if there's an adjacent hydrogen that can move, changing the structure.

Benzoquinone—wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups, right? Or maybe it's more like a diketone in a benzene ring. Oh, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, or something similar. Wait, actually, benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para and ortho. But regardless, the structure has two ketone groups. Now, for tautomerism to occur, there should be a possibility for a hydrogen to move from an adjacent position. But in benzoquinone, each ketone is on a benzene ring. So the carbonyl groups are attached directly to the benzene. Are there any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups that can shift?

Wait, in a carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons are usually from the ring. So the carbonyl is C=O, and the adjacent carbon is part of the aromatic ring. The aromatic ring's hydrogens are attached to the ring carbons, which are themselves attached to the carbonyl. So, for tautomerism, you'd need a hydrogen on the same carbon as the carbonyl, but in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a benzene ring, so the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So the hydrogens are not on the same carbon as the carbonyl. Therefore, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I think not. Because the H that would need to move is on the ring, but moving that would require breaking the ring, which is unlikely. So benzoquinone doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Now, looking at cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is O=C-(CH2) around the ring. Each ketone is on a carbon that's adjacent to other carbons. Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at opposite positions. So the carbons are numbered 1,3,5 with O=C, and the others are CH2. So each of those carbonyl carbons has two CH2 groups attached? No, wait: each carbonyl is at each alternate carbon. So between each O=C is a CH2. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2- etc. So each carbonyl is on a carbon that is attached to two CH2 groups.

Wait, but for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group. Let me think. In a ketone, the carbonyl is R-CO-R'. To have tautomerism, like in enol and keto forms, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl, meaning on the adjacent carbon. So, if the carbonyl in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has adjacent hydrogens, then it can undergo tautomerism.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at position 1,3,5, and the adjacent carbons are CH2, which have two hydrogens each. So each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group. So, each of these can lose a hydrogen, leading to enol formation. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exhibit tautomerism, as each carbonyl group is next to a CH2 with H's that can move.

So for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. Therefore, A is benzoquinone. So the correct choice for A is either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Wait, no, wait! The question says, which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, then the one that doesn't would be benzoquinone.

So part A's answer is A = benzoquinone.

Now, moving on to part B. The question is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, some compounds can have a plane of symmetry or other factors preventing chirality, but generally, it's about having a chiral center.

First, let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is: the propanoate part is CH2-CHOH-COOCH3. Let me draw it: the central carbon (C2) has OH, two CH3 groups (no, wait). Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the propanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, that's not right. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. No, wait, wait! Let's correct that. The formula of propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So it would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH.

But when it's the ester, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be: the carboxylic acid is converted to methyl ester. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the middle carbon.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure:

Propanoate ester: the parent acid is propanoic acid, so the ester would be R-O-CO-CH2CH2-O-. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No. Wait, the formula is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Or is it CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the molecule for possible chiral centers. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (if any) would be the one where the hydroxyl is attached.

Wait, the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate part is CH2-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, that would be CH2 is connected to the next carbon, which has OH, then COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is: O

So:
- The central carbon is the second carbon (CH(OH)), connected to two CH2 groups? Hmm, no, perhaps not. Let me think: the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the carboxylic acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. Then the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH2OH

Wait, no. Wait, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the carboxylic acid with the OR group. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

The central carbon is the one with the hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a CH2COOCH3. Hmm, wait, no. Let me count the substituents on that carbon. The carbon with OH is attached to:

- One CH2 group (from the CH2CH2... no, wait, no. Let me imagine the structure as:

The molecule is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. The propanoate part has three carbons. The ester is formed from the carboxylic acid. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) has an OH group, a COOCH3 group, and two CH3 groups? No, because propanoate is a three-carbon chain. So, perhaps the structure is:

The central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- One OH group,

- One CH3 group (from C1),

- One CH2COOCH3 group (from C3),

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The molecule is O

So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-C(O)OCH3

Wait, but that would be a two-carbon chain, not three. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead think about the possible chiral centers.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the carbon where the hydroxyl is attached (C2) is connected to:

- OH,

- The adjacent carbons: so C1 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

No, wait, that would be propanoate with the OH on C2. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)CH2OH. So, the central carbon is C2, connected to:

- COOCH3,

- CH2OH,

- Two CH2 groups? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, which would make the central carbon (C2) attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- CH2 (from the next carbon? No, wait, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible presence of a chiral center. For a chiral center, the carbon must have four distinct groups.

So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) has:

- CH3,

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and another substituent?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is (2R)- or (2S)-configured, with four different substituents.

Wait, wait, let me think of the structure as:

The molecule is HO-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, that would make it a two-carbon chain, but that's not possible because propanoate is three carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I should look this up mentally. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which has the structure HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two CH2 groups (from the adjacent carbons)? Wait, no. Let me number the carbons:

Carboxylic acid group: COOCH3 is on C3. C2 has the OH, and C1 is CH2.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the carbon with OH is C2. What are the four substituents on C2?

- One OH,

- One CH2COOCH3 group,

- Two CH2 groups? No, that can't be. Because C2 is connected to C1 (CH2 group), C3 (another CH2 group), and the OH.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

C1: CH2-

C2: CH(OH)-

C3: COOCH3

So the substituents on C2 are:

- OH,

- CH2- (from C1),

- CH2- (from C3),

- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the carbons are:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2,

- COOCH3,

Wait, but that's only three substituents. Wait, maybe I'm not seeing this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The ester is formed by the acid: CH2(OH)CH2COOH, which becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbon with OH is CH2(OH), connected to another CH2 and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, so the carbon with the OH is CH2(OH), which is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on that carbon are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the carbon with the hydroxyl has two identical substituents, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider the molecule as:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the OH is on the first carbon, and the COOCH3 is on the third. So, the middle carbon is CH2. So, the substituents on the middle carbon are two CH2 groups, a COOCH3, and a hydrogen? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the middle carbon is CH2 connected to the OH on the first carbon and the COOCH3 on the third.

Wait, maybe the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. Oh wait, no, that would be four carbons, but propanoate is three. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just give up and think about the possible optical isomerism. If the compound has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the carbon where the hydroxyl is attached is the central carbon. So, if that carbon is attached to four different groups, it's chiral.

So, substituents would be:

1. OH,

2. CH2COOCH3,

3. CH3,

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (if the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, then the middle CH2 is connected to two CH2 groups, which are not identical. Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

On the central carbon (C2):

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2-,

and another CH2-.

Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think of a different approach. Maybe I should instead look at dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid, with the two double bonds in a trans configuration. So, its structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid, but wait no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with double bonds, wait no. Wait, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with the double bond between the second and third carbons, and the substituents (the two COOH groups) on opposite sides. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the two carboxylic acid groups are on C1 and C4. So, the structure is trans (E) configuration.

When it forms dimethyl fumarate, each of the -COOH groups becomes a COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no. Let me think: the fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, that can't be because that would be succinic acid. Fumaric acid is a substituted butenedioic acid. So, the correct structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on either end and a double bond in the middle.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, each -OH of the carboxylic acid becomes OCH3. So, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Ah, so the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=CH
    /
O=C-OCH3

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, the structure is:

Each of the two COOH groups becomes COOCH3. So, the molecule is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the central double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is planar around the double bond, but since the substituents are same on each side, perhaps it doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, no. Fumarate is a trans (E) diastereomer. So, its structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. If it's a trans (E) isomer, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right because the structure would have a double bond. So, the correct structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But that would be a single bond, which isn't correct. The correct structure should have a double bond between the two middle carbons.

So, the correct structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Let me think: the fumaric acid structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so when esterified, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group.

In this structure, the molecule has two COOCH3 groups on either end of the double bond. Now, considering the possibility of geometric isomerism (cis or trans), but in terms of optical isomerism, which depends on chirality, not geometry.

Wait, but does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's look at each carbon in the molecule.

The two central carbons (the ones connected by the double bond) are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond. So, each of these carbons has two COOCH3, one CH2, and a double bond. Wait, no. Let's see: the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group? No, perhaps not.

Wait, in the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to:

- Two COOCH3 groups,

- and a CH2 group (for the left CH2),

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3, a CH2, and a double bond. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is O

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, each has two identical substituents, which would make them not chiral.

Wait, if each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups, then each has two identical substituents. So, each of these carbons would not be a chiral center.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, there's no chiral center. Therefore, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. So, the compound that shows optical isomerism must be the other one, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. Let me reevaluate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that's a three-carbon chain. So, the structure is:

CH3 - C(OH) - COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (C2) has:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another substituent. Wait, what's attached to the other side? If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and a hydrogen? No, because that would make it a secondary alcohol, but the carbon would have four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen. But wait, that's four substituents, but two are the same (CH3 and H? No, H is a different substituent than CH3). So, the substituents would be:

1. CH3,

2. COOCH3,

3. OH,

4. H.

So, four different substituents, which makes that carbon a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. In the structure I'm visualizing, the middle carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and the adjacent carbon from the other side, which is the next CH3 or COOCH3?

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from C1),

- COOCH3 (from C3),

- OH,

- and a hydrogen? No, because each carbon in a chain is connected to two other carbons (except the ends). So, for C2 in propanoate, it's connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (COOCH3), and two hydrogens (but wait, in the case of the hydroxyl, one of those hydrogens is replaced by OH). So, the substituents would be:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that's four different groups, making it a chiral center. So yes, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, so it can't show optical isomerism. So, between the two compounds, which one can show optical isomerism? According to this, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show it, and dimethyl fumarate cannot.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting conflicting thoughts because I'm not entirely sure about the structures. Let me think again.

Fumarate (dimethyl fumarate) is an ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The ester would be O=C-OCH3 attached to both ends, so the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

In this structure, each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each of these carbons has two identical substituents (two COOCH3), a CH2 group (on the left) and another CH2 (on the right), but wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But that would be a single bond, which isn't the case. So the correct structure must have a double bond between the two middle carbons.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

In this case, each of the double-bonded carbons (the two CH groups) is attached to:

- One COOCH3,

- and one CH2 group.

Wait, no, the right side would be a COOCH3 group attached to each CH.

So, each of the double-bonded carbons has:

- One CH2 group (on the left for the left CH),

- One COOCH3 group (on the right),

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to:

- Two COOCH3 groups and the double bond. But if that's the case, then each has two identical substituents, making them not chiral.

So, if a carbon is attached to two identical groups, it can't be a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center, as the middle carbon is attached to four different groups. Therefore, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but looking back at the options, part B is which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism. So the correct answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but I thought earlier that dimethyl fumarate is an E isomer and perhaps has some symmetry. Let me think: does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, if you imagine the molecule, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond axis. Therefore, it's not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, looking at the options:

Option B says A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the correct option is option B.


To determine the correct answers to the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the given information.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen atom and a bond shift positions, leading to structural isomerism. For this to happen, the compound must have an adjacent hydrogen atom to the carbonyl group.

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has a benzene ring with two ketone groups. The carbonyl carbons are directly attached to the aromatic ring, and there are no hydrogens on the carbonyl carbons themselves. Since tautomerism requires a hydrogen on the carbonyl carbon, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each carbonyl carbon is adjacent to a CH₂ group, which contains hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift to form enol tautomers, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-C(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to:
   - A methyl group (CH₃),
   - A hydroxyl group (OH),
   - An ester group (COOCH₃),
   - And a hydrogen atom (H).
   Since all four substituents are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The double-bonded carbons are each bonded to two identical groups (COOCH₃ groups), so they are not chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans (E) configuration, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism),
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
