Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state. The state vector is |ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|−α>)/N. I remember that |α> and |−α> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so any superposition of them would be non-Gaussian. But wait, under what conditions? If the state is a simple coherent state, it's Gaussian. But when it's a superposition, it's non-Gaussian. So in this case, since it's a sum of two coherent states with possibly different phases, the state should be non-Gaussian.

The question is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix, and rho is the non-Gaussian state's.

Wait, relative entropy... Oh right, the relative entropy of quantum states is also known as the quantum Kullback-Leibler divergence. It measures how different rho is from tau. So the non-Gaussianity would be this del_b value.

But wait, the problem states
