Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that equilibrium temperature has to do with the balance between the energy a planet absorbs and the energy it emits. The formula I think is something like T = (L*(1 - A)/(16 * π * σ * D²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe it's simplified for this problem. Oh right, since all the planets have the same albedo (A), that factor cancels out when taking the ratio.

The planets are in orbital resonance with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is P2=2*P1, Planet_3 is P3=2.5*P1, and so on. I think the key here is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. So the farther away, the lower the temperature because they receive less energy.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature when considering orbital period relates to the inverse square law. I think the formula is T ∝ (P^(-1/2)). Because the period is related to the distance cubed over the square of the star's mass (Kepler's third law), but since we're only dealing with the same star and planets, P is proportional to a^(3/2), where 'a' is the semi-major axis (which is the radius for circular orbits). So a = (G*M*P²/(4π²))^(1/3), but maybe I don't need to get into that.

Alternatively, I've heard that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the energy received per unit time is flux divided by the period (since energy is power times time, and flux is power per unit area). So T is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4) = (L/(16πσ))^(1/4) * (1/D²)^(1/4) = (L/(16πσ))^(1/4) * D^(-1/2). But D is proportional to a, and a is proportional to P^(2/3) from Kepler's law. Wait, maybe I can link P and T more directly.

Wait, another
