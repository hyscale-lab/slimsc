Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each with different combinations of energies.

Hmm, first, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy of a single particle in the nth level is given by E_n = (n² E), since E is that base energy unit. So for each particle, their energy depends on their quantum number n.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Oh, right, they're spin-1/2, which means they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're fermions, each can have a unique set of quantum numbers, including their spin. So in a potential well, each particle must occupy a unique quantum state.

But wait, the potential is one-dimensional, so the quantum numbers are just n_x for each particle. But because they're spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up or down). Oh, so that might allow more particles in the same spatial state because of different spins. Or wait, no, in this case, the particles are identical fermions, so each must have a unique combination of spatial and spin quantum numbers.

Wait, in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n. Each n can have two possible spin states, so for each n, you can have two particles: one with spin up and another with spin down. So for four particles, how do they fill the energy levels?

Let me think. The ground state would be the lowest possible energy configuration. For four particles, each with spin 1/2, each spatial orbital can hold two particles. So the first orbital (n=1) can have two particles. The second orbital (n=2) can have two as well. But wait, that's four particles total. So ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but no. Each orbital is a specific n, and each can hold two particles (due to spin).
