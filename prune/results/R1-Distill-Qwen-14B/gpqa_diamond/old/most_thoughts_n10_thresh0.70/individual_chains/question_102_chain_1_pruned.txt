Okay, so I have this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup is that a new ligand-receptor pair was identified in neural crest cells. The question is about why, when they looked for the eGFP signal under the microscope, they didn't see any green. So the experiment didn't work as expected. Let's go through the details.

First, the construct: it's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ligand is first, then the receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Wait, CBA is the chicken beta actin promoter, which is a strong promoter. So the ligand should be expressed from that. The receptor has an IRES upstream. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive the expression of a second gene in a bicistronic mRNA. So the setup is probably that the ligand and receptor are co-expressed from the same mRNA, with the IRES allowing for translation of the receptor after the ligand.

Wait, but looking at the stops... There's a stop cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry, using loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272 cassette. Oh, right, the loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. Cre recombinase will recognize loxP sites, but not lox2272? Or wait, lox2272 is a mutant version that can't be cut by Cre, but it's used in combination with FLP recombinase, I think. So in this setup, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so it's expressed, but the mCherry is behind a stop cassette (loxP-stop). So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop is present, preventing mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is under the control of the IRES, so its expression depends on the upstream sequences. The eGFP has a stop cassette with lox2272.

Wait, but the vector is lox-Cre, so when the Cre is active, it would excise the loxP sites. So, in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette between ligand and mCherry would be excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed as a fusion. Similarly, the stop before eGFP is under lox2272, which Cre can't cut, I think. So without FLP, the eGFP would remain under
