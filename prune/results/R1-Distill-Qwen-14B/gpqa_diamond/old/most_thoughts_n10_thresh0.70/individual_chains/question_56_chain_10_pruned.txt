Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom's transition between energy levels, and I need to figure out the correct option. Let's start by breaking down what I know about atomic transitions and the selection rules.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ through two dipole transitions. The options are different routes and their corresponding probabilities. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen according to certain selection rules. 

First, let me recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The selection rules are:

Δn = ±1, 0 (but in reality, Δn can't be zero for a transition to happen)
Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit)
Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number changes by 0 or ±1)

Wait, no, more accurately, for a dipole transition, the selection rules are:

Δl = ±1
Δm = 0, ±1

And Δn can be any integer, but in practice, for allowed transitions, the steps would be such that energy is emitted or absorbed. But wait, actually, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but in reality, only certain transitions are allowed due to the selection rules on l and m.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It's an s-orbital (l=0). The possible transitions from l=0 would need to go to l=1 (since Δl must be ±1). So the first transition would be from l=0 to l=1, meaning the next state after the first transition must have l=1.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So first transition is from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. That's allowed because Δl=+1. Then from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. That's allowed because Δl= -1. So this route is possible.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1. So from m=0 to m=1. That's allowed (Δm=+1). Then from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0. Wait, but here, the transition would have to change l from 1 to 0, which is allowed (Δl=-1), but what about m? From m=1 to m=0. That's Δm=-1, which is allowed. So the second transition is allowed. So this option's route is possible.

Option C: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0. So first, m goes from 0 to -1 (Δm=-1), which is allowed. Then in the second step, m goes from -1 to 0 (Δm=+1), which is allowed. So the route is possible.

Option D: The initial part is missing, but looking at the option, it says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩. So m stays the same (Δm=0), which is allowed. Then from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. m goes from 0 to 0 (Δm=0), which is allowed. So that's a possible route.

But wait, the problem is about the transition probability. The question asks which transition route and the corresponding probability is correct.

So I need to calculate the probabilities for each possible option.

I remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the dipole matrix element. The matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the spherical harmonics integrals. The probability amplitude for each transition depends on the integral of Y_{l', m'}^* Y_{l, m} Y_{L, M}, where L is the dipole operator's angular momentum (which is 1). 

But perhaps a simpler way is to know that for an electric dipole transition, the transition is allowed only if the selection rules are met, and the probability depends on the change in m and l. 

Wait, but in the case of a two-step transition, each step must meet the selection
