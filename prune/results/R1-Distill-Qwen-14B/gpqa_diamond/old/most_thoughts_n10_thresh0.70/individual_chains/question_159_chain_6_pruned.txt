Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's comoving distance. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar in the near-infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, what does that tell me? Oh right, in quasars, emission lines are often prominent, and the Lyman-alpha emission line is a big one. Lyman-alpha is emitted when electrons in hydrogen drop from the second energy level to the first. The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, in the observed spectrum, the peak is at 790 nm. That seems way longer than 121.6 nm. So that must mean that the quasar's light is redshifted. Because when light is redshifted, the wavelength stretches.

So the observed wavelength is 790 nm. The rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. So the redshift z is (observed - rest)/rest. Let me calculate that: (790 - 121.6)/121.6. Let's see, 790 minus 121.6 is 668.4. Divided by 121.6, that's about 5.5. Wait
