Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about oxygen acting as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, both thermodynamically and kinetically. Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its tendency to be reduced. So, a stronger oxidant has a higher tendency to accept electrons.

Wait, oxygen is a common oxidizing agent. In basic solutions, like in the presence of OH⁻ ions, oxygen might form different products compared to acidic conditions. Like, in basic solutions, oxygen might react to form hydroxide ions (like water or something else), whereas in acidic, it might form water or O2? Not exactly sure, but I think about the standard reduction potentials.

Oh right, the standard reduction potential for the O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e⁻ → 2 H2O reaction is higher (like around 1.23 V) in acidic solution. But in basic solution, the same reaction would involve OH⁻. The reaction would be O2 + 2 H2O + 4 e⁻ → 4 OH⁻, right? I think the standard potential for that might be lower. Because when you're in a basic solution, the H+ concentration is low, so the potential might decrease. So in acidic, O2 has a higher E°, making it a stronger oxidant.

Wait, but wait. The standard conditions for the O2 reaction in acidic is when pH is low. In basic, the pH is high. So, the E° depends on the solution's pH. So, the thermodynamic strength of the oxidant—like, how strong it is as an oxidant—depends on the solution's acidity.

So thermodynamically, in a basic solution, is oxygen a weaker or stronger oxidant compared to acidic? Let me think. Since the E° for O2 in basic is lower than in acidic (because in acidic, the reaction is more favorable), that means O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions. So in basic, it's a weaker oxidant.

So the first blank in the question, thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic. So the first part is 'weaker' since it's comparing to the same substance in different conditions.

Now, the second part is about kinetic reactivity in acidic versus basic. Kinetics is about how fast the reaction happens, not whether it's favorable. So, even if a reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it might not proceed quickly if the activation energy is high.

In acidic solutions, O2 can act as a stronger oxidant, but what about the reaction rate? I remember that in acidic conditions, the reaction might proceed faster because of the presence of H+ ions. Those can help in the reaction by stabilizing intermediates or facilitating the electron transfer. Also, the reaction in acidic conditions might involve more ions, making the reaction faster.

Alternatively, sometimes in basic solutions, the presence of OH⁻ can lead to different reaction pathways that have higher activation energies, making the reaction slower. Like, maybe the reaction in basic conditions requires the O2 to react with OH⁻ first, which could be a slower process compared to acidic where H+ is abundant.

So, the kinetic part: in acidic solutions, O2 reacts faster. So the second blank is 'faster'.

Wait, putting it all together. The statement is: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a ….. oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts ….. in acidic solutions.

So, thermodynamically in basic, it's weaker. Kinetic in acidic, it's faster. So the blanks are 'weaker' and 'faster'.

Looking at the options, option C is 'weaker – faster' and option A is 'stronger – faster'. Wait, the first part is about basic solutions, so the first word is thermodynamic. So the first blank should be 'weaker' because in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant.

So the options:

A) stronger – faster → No, first part is wrong.

B) stronger – slower → Both wrong.

C) weaker – faster → Yes, this matches.

D) weaker – slower → No, because in acidic, it's faster.

So the correct answer should be option C.


In electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its tendency to accept electrons, which is influenced by the solution's pH. Oxygen (O₂) acts as a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. This is because the standard reduction potential for the reaction in acidic conditions (O₂ + 4 H⁺ + 4 e⁻ → 2 H₂O) is higher (around 1.23 V) than in basic conditions (O₂ + 2 H₂O + 4 e⁻ → 4 OH⁻). Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

Kinetically, the reaction rate depends on the solution's conditions. In acidic solutions, the presence of H⁺ ions facilitates the reaction by stabilizing intermediates and lowering the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the reaction may involve OH⁻ ions, which can lead to slower kinetics. Thus, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations, the correct answer is that oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions and reacts **faster** kinetically in acidic solutions.

Answer: C
