Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me read the problem again.

The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is initially at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two energies, probably the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, neutrinos have very small (almost zero) rest mass, right? So their kinetic energy would be almost equal to their total energy. But I'm not sure. Hmm.

So, since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So after the decay, the total momentum of the products must be zero too. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But since neutrinos are leptons, their energy is a bit tricky.

I remember that in particle decay problems, when the parent is at rest, the maximum energy for each product is when they are emitted in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum vectors. But since neutrinos are massless (or nearly so), their energy would just be their momentum times c, but maybe in units where c=1, it's just equal to their momentum.

Wait, let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest energy plus kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).

So, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu, and E_nu = K_nu.

So total energy after decay: E_mu + E_nu = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu. This should equal 139.6 MeV.

Also, the total momentum must be zero. So the vectors of the muon's and neutrino's momenta must cancel each other. Let's denote p_mu as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and p_nu as the neutrino's momentum. So p_mu = p_nu, because they have to balance each other.

But wait, the muon has mass, so its momentum is related to its energy. The energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c )² + (m_mu c² )² ) / c²? Wait, maybe I should be careful with units. Since the problem is in MeV, and c is set to 1 in these units, I can simplify.

So in natural units where c=1, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² + m_mu² ), and E_nu = p_nu, since m_nu is approximately zero. Because for the neutrino, E = pc when m is zero.

So, since the momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, p_mu = p_nu. So p_nu = p_mu.

Wait
