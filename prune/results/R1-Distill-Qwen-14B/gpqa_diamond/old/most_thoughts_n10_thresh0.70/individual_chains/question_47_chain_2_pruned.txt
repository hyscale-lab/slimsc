Okay, so I have this question about identifying an organic compound based on spectral data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are in the range for N-H stretches. Usually, amines or amides show these. Since there are two peaks close together, maybe it's an amide with two N-H groups like a primary amide, which has two N-H bonds. Alternatively, it could be from an amine, but amides typically have stronger absorption. Also, the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That peak is usually a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound likely has both an amide group and an ester, or maybe just an amide and a carbonyl from something else like a ketone. Wait, but the molecular formula has two oxygen atoms, right? C9H11NO2. So, two oxygen-containing groups. So maybe an ester and an amide? Or perhaps a ketone and an amide. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is more indicative of an ester or a ketone. But esters usually have that around 1740, but conjugated esters or amides might lower it. Alternatively, a carbonyl from an amide is usually in the range of 1680-1700. Hmm, so 1720 might be an ester. Wait, but if the compound has an amide group, its carbonyl would be around 1680. Maybe the 1720 is for an ester. So perhaps the compound has both an ester and an amide. But wait, looking at the options, let's see.

The H NMR data: 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) suggests an ethyl group attached to something else, maybe an oxygen or a nitrogen. Because the triplet is from CH2CH3, so the ethyl group is probably an OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) or NCH2CH3. But considering the other parts, let's see.

At 4.0 ppm, a broad singlet (2H). Broad singlet could be from an NH group, but wait, in the IR, I saw N-H stretches. So maybe this is an NH2 group that's exchanging and broad. Alternatively, it could be an OCH2 group. Hmm, but 4.0 is a bit upfield for OCH2. Wait, if it's an amide, the NH could be in that region, but it's a broad peak, so perhaps it's an NH group. Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 group from an ester.

Wait, looking at the other shifts: 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H). Quartet suggests a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe that's the ethyl ester part. Because in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would
