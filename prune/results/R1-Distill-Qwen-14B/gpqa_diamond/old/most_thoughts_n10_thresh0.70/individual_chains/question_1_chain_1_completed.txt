Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To resolve these two states, ΔE should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties: ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Because when you have two states, each with their own uncertainties, the total uncertainty in their separation would depend on both. Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the difference is the sum. Let me get this straight.

The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of uncertainties in E2 and E1. So ΔE_total ≈ ΔE2 + ΔE1. Therefore, for the two energies to be distinguishable, the actual energy difference must be larger than this total uncertainty.

So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2. Let's plug in the numbers. 

First, ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe it's easier to convert everything to eV·s.

Wait, I know that 1 eV = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 J. So, converting ħ to eV·s:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602176634e-19 J) ≈ 6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s.

Right, so ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s.

So, for the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait a second, that can't be right. Let's compute that again.

Wait, 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 6.582e-7 eV. And 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-8 is 6.582e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 = 6.582e-7 eV, and ΔE2 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the total uncertainty would be ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because if the two energy levels each have their own uncertainties, the uncertainty in their difference would be the sum. So to resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than this total uncertainty.

So, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than 7.24e-7 eV. Now we look at the options provided.

The options are A) 1e-9 eV, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8.

Wait, calculating 7.24e-7 eV is 0.724e-6 eV, which is 724 micro-eV. The options are much smaller than that, except option C.

Wait, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 micro-eV. Hmm, but 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 7.24e-7 eV (0.000000724 eV). So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is about a hundred times larger than the total uncertainty.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The question asks for an energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. So, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the difference, which is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

In this case, the sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV. So, any energy difference larger than that would allow us to see them as separate peaks or distinguishable.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV (0.0001 eV), which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So that would work. But let me check the other options.

Option A is 1e-9 eV: 0.000000001 eV. That's way smaller than 7.24e-7 eV. So no, that's not bigger.

Option B is 1e-11 eV, even smaller. So no.

Option D is 1e-8 eV: 0.00000001 eV. Still smaller than 7.24e-7 eV. So no.

Only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is larger. Hence, the correct answer must be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think if I did the calculations correctly. Because I'm getting a bit confused with the exponents.

Wait, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / 1e-9 s = 6.58e-7 eV. Which is 0.724 femto-eV? Wait, no, wait, 6.582e-7 eV is 0.0000006582 eV.

Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV, which is 0.0000000658 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 0.7e-6 eV and ΔE2 is 0.0658e-6 eV. So their sum is approximately 0.7658e-6 eV, which is about 7.66e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than ~7.7e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 / 1e-6 = 100 times larger than 1e-6 eV. So 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV is larger than 7.7e-7 eV (which is 0.00000077 eV). So 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is way larger than 7.7e-7.

So option C is way above the required energy difference, so the energy difference of 1e-4 eV would allow us to distinguish the two levels.

But wait, wait a second. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So, the minimum energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in this difference, which is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

So, if the energy difference is, say, 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than ~1e-6 eV, then yes, it's resolvable.

But looking at the options, option C is the only one that's larger than the required 7.7e-7 eV. So the answer must be option C.

But wait, let me think again because sometimes I might be mixing up the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because each state has its own lifetime, so each has its own energy uncertainty. So when the two states are in a superposition, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the two individual uncertainties.

So, yes, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

So option C is the only one that fits.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates energy and time uncertainty as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) corresponds to the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For two states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.00000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller. Not sufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
