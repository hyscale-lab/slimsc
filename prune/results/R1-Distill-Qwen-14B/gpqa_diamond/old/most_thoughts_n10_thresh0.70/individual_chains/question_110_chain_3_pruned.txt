Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go up to 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh, wait, magnitude scales are a bit tricky. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's lower than 17. So the detectable range for ESPRESSO is V ≤ 17. Similarly, for HIRES, it's V ≤16. Because anything brighter than 16 is magnitude less than or equal to 16.

So the key is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 because that's what HIRES can see, and also ≤17 for ESPRESSO. But wait, no. Wait, because ESPRESSO can observe stars up to 17 mag, meaning it can detect stars as faint as 17, but not beyond. HIRES can go up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES can't see fainter than 16. So both spectrographs can detect it if it's <=16.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. The question states that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means M_V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe M_V <16. So any star with M_V less than 16 can be seen by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's certainly brighter than 17, so both can see it. But some stars might be between 16 and 17, which ESPRESSO can see but HIRES can't. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

So now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are ≤16. Also, some stars have E(B-V) given, which suggests interstellar extinction, so their apparent magnitudes are affected. Oh right, because interstellar dust causes extinction, making stars appear dimmer and redder. So their observed magnitudes are higher (fainter) than their intrinsic.

The formula I remember is: apparent magnitude = absolute magnitude + distance modulus + extinction. Or wait, let's think in terms of distance modulus and extinction.

The formula is: m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5 + A_V
Wait, extinction A_V is related to E(B-V). The problem states that the total absorption in V band is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). Because E(B-V) is the color excess, and A_V is the extinction in V band.

So for each star, I'll need to calculate their apparent V magnitude (

Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to remember what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning up to 17 mag or lower. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 V mag, so up to 16 mag or lower.

So any star that's apparent V magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be seen by HIRES. Therefore, a star that both can detect must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16, because that's the limit for HIRES, which is stricter than ESPRESSO's 17 mag limit.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, if a star is brighter than (apparent V mag ≤) 16, both can see it. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so any star below 17 can be seen by both? No, wait, no: wait, no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V magnitude of 16 is brighter than one with 17. So if a spectrograph can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, that would mean it can observe stars with V ≤17, right? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Wait, no, the way it's written: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, when they say brighter than, does that mean magnitude less than 17 (since lower magnitudes are brighter), or greater than 17? Oh. Magnitude scale is a bit tricky. So a star with V magnitude of 1 is brighter than a star with V=6. So when they say "brighter than 17 mag", it's stars with V <17. Because 17 is fainter than 16. So if a star's V is 16.5, it's brighter than 17.

Wait, let me double-check. So the ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17. HIRES can observe stars with V ≤16.

So a star must have V ≤16 to be detected by both, because HIRES can't see stars above 16. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤16 for both to see it.

Now, let's go through each star and calculate their apparent V magnitudes.

Star1: absolute V mag = 15.5, distance is 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) at 10 pc. So since Star1 is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as its absolute
