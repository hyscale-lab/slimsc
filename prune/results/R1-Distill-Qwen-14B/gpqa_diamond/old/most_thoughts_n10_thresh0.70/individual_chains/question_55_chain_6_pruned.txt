Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different types of acetates: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, and Trans-butenyl. Hmm.

First, I think I need to recall what each of these structures looks like. Acetates are esters, right? So, they have the structure R-O-CO-O-R or wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. Wait, no, the general formula is RCOOR', where R is the alkyl or aryl group from the acid and R' is from the alcohol. So, propenyl and butenyl would be the R' groups here.

So, propenyl would have a double bond, either as CH2=CHCH2- or maybe CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but more accurately, the structure could be CH2=CH2-CH2-O-CO-OAc? Wait, no, acetate is the acetyl group, so the ester is formed from acetic acid and an alcohol. So, the structure would be AcO-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. The ester from acetic acid is OAc-O-R, but more accurately, it's CH3COO-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. So, for propenyl acetate, R would be CH2CH=CH2? Or is it something else. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- something. So, propenyl could be CH2=CHCH2-OAc or CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere else. Wait, no. Propenyl groups are either allyl (CH2=CHCH2-) or isopropenyl (CH2=C(CH3)-).

Wait, so propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- when it's the allyl type. Then, butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond. So,
