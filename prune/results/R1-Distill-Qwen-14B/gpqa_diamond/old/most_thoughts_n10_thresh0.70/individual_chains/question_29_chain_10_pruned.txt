Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for synthesizing this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene's sequence in each mutant. The changes were in the first exon area. I need to find which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so the goal is to eliminate the compound. That probably means we want to disrupt the gene so it doesn't produce the compound. But how does that happen? Well, if the gene is disrupted, the protein might not be made or might be nonfunctional. So the mutation needs to cause a change that stops the gene from working.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the first exon. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutation in them could affect the protein product. But wait, the first exon is early in the gene, so a frameshift or a stop codon early on could significantly change the protein.

Let me look at each option:

The intact gene is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So comparing to the wild type, the 4th nucleotide is T in wild type, but in mutant 1 it's C. Let me see: the wild type starts ATG TTT CGC ... So the first few nucleotides are ATGTTTCTCGCTGG... In mutant 1, the sequence changes to ATGTTCTACGCTGG... So the fourth and fifth positions change, perhaps leading to a different amino acid.

Wait, let me see the exact changes. Let's break it down:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... 
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT GCG ... 

Wait, perhaps I should look at the exact sequence. Let me check the exact letters.

Wait, the wild type is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, let's look at the first part. Wild type starts with ATGTTTCTC... So the sequence is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...

Mutant 1's sequence is ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...

Wait, so
