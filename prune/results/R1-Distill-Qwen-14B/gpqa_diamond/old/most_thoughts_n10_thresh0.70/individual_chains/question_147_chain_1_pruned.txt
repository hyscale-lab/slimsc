Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about an annihilation process. Hmm, the question says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate and produce two particles each of type A+. And A-. The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, wait. Let me think. So the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So in this reaction, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton is probably at rest because it's not mentioned, but the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, wait no, the antiproton is moving slowly... wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some low velocity. Or wait, maybe both are moving, but the antiproton is moving but with a low speed. Hmm, not too sure about the setup.

Wait, the key here is that the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So perhaps we can approximate its energy as just its rest mass plus a small kinetic energy, but maybe in this problem, the velocity is so low that we can approximate it as non-relativistic. Or maybe since it's moving slowly, we can treat it as having non-relativistic speeds. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the conservation laws. Since this is an annihilation process, I should consider conservation of energy and momentum. But in annihilation, the initial particles' energy and momentum must equal the final particles' totals.

Assuming that the proton is at rest, which is a common assumption unless stated otherwise. So the proton has some rest mass energy, and the antiproton has some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly
