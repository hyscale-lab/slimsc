Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. So maybe I should check that. Let me calculate the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T but normalized. So maybe the actual state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))^T. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention normalizing. Hmm, maybe I should proceed as if it's given, but perhaps the way the operators are set up, it's already normalized. Or maybe the problem doesn't require normalization since the operators are given as such. Hmm.

The problem is about measuring P and then Q. Wait, the measurement of Q is done just after P, so we're looking for the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1. So the process would involve first measuring P, getting 0, then measuring Q, getting -1. So I think I need to find the probability of getting 0 in the P measurement, then the conditional probability of getting -1 in Q given that P was 0, and multiply them together.

But wait, wait, perhaps more accurately, the combined probability is the probability that the system is in
