Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but I think I can break it down.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted based on conservation laws. The options are A to D, each involving different transitions.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Let me recall what that means. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1 =1 implies S=0. L is S in this notation, so L=0 as well, and J would be 0 because L and S are both 0, so J=0+0=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X, so the final state is the NN plus X. But the problem is about the possible partial waves of X, which I suppose refers to the orbital angular momentum carried by X when it's emitted.

The question is about which partial wave isn't allowed. So I think I need to consider angular momentum and parity conservation.

First, when a particle is emitted, the total angular momentum and parity should be conserved. So the initial state has certain J and parity, and the final state must have the same.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Since parity for a two-body system (like the NN) is given by (-1)^L. Here, L is 0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So when it's emitted, its contribution to the overall parity would be considered.

But how does this fit into the overall conservation? Let me think. The parity of the entire system (initial) is the parity of the NN state. After emission, the parity should be the same as before. So the parity of the final state (NN + X) must be equal to the initial parity.

The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Wait, no, because the NN system and X are separate. So their combined parity would be the parity of the NN system times the parity of X. But wait, in reality, when you have a decay, the parity is conserved, so the initial parity (Pi) must equal the final parity (Pf).

So, initial system parity Pi = +1.

After emitting
