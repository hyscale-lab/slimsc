Okay, so I'm trying to answer this SMEFT question. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll think through it. Let's see, the question is about which symmetries all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect.

The options given are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm. I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, respecting the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have?

I think the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry. Because the particles are described by fields that transform under the Lorentz group, right? So any operator in SMEFT must also transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry is a must. That means options that include 1 are possible; those that exclude 1 are out.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Wait, I remember that Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a broader symmetry. But does SMEFT require Poincaré? Because in SMEFT, the operators are written in the Standard Model background, which already includes Poincaré symmetry. So the operators themselves don't have to be invariant under translations because the background handles that. So perhaps the operators don't have to explicitly respect Poincaré symmetry beyond what Lorentz symmetry implies. So Poincaré might not be a must for each operator.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, valid below the electroweak scale. Effective theories usually include all symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model is Poincaré invariant, so SMEFT should be as well. So maybe all operators in SMEFT must be Poincaré invariant. So that would mean both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are required.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Because the Poincaré group includes translations. So if the theory is Poincaré invariant, then the operators must transform appropriately under translations. But in SMEFT, the operators are written as local operators, so perhaps they automatically respect translation invariance. So maybe both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. So looking at the options, options that include both 1 and 2.

But wait, I think the SMEFT operators are
