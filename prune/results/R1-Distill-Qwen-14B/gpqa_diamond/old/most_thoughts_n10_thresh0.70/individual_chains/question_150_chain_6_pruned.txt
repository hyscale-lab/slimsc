Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and there are three reactions happening in sequence. I need to figure out what the final product is, right?

First, I should probably look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The NMR shows peaks at 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That's a pretty upfield shift. Wait, high ppm is deshielded. Oh wait, 9.72 is actually a downfield shift, which is common for aldehydes. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. But wait, an aldehyde is typically a singlet because the aldehyde proton is usually deshielded and doesn't split much. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, maybe the 9.72 ppm is something else. Let me think. Another possibility is an aromatic ring with substituents. Or maybe an enol? Or perhaps it's an aldehyde with some coupling... Or maybe it's an exchange broadened peak, but the question says it's a triplet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom or something.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H) â€” those are likely from an aromatic ring. The coupling constants for doublets of 2H each suggests a para-substituted ring. Like two substituents opposite each other. Wait, but the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group or something acidic. Wait, but it's 2H as a singlet. Maybe that's a di-substituted ring with two substituents that are each adjacent to an oxygen? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with two adjacent protons, but that doesn't fit with being a singlet. Hmm.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a downfield shift for CH2. Could be attached to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative atom. But the fact that it's a doublet (2H) suggests it's adjacent to another CH2 group or a group with two protons.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees: could be a benzene ring (3) + one double bond (1) +
