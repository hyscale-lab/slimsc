Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give different possibilities for the relative speed and total energy. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics because of the velocity addition formula. And for energy, each astronaut's energy would be their rest mass energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma. So I need to calculate both the relative speed and the sum of their energies.

Wait, but first, relative speed. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1*v2)/c²). Let me make sure I got that right. So for the relative speed between them, since they're moving in the same direction, I think I subtract the smaller speed from the larger one and apply the formula. Wait no, both are moving in the same direction, so from the perspective of one astronaut, what's the speed of the other? Oh, right, the relative velocity would be (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²), where v is the velocity of the astronaut's frame relative to the other. Wait, let's get that straight.

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at
