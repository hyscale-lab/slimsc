Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details of their decay.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D, all in the order of 10^-15 to 10^-16 meters.

Wait, so decay distance... I think that has to do with how far the meson travels before it decays. So the mean decay length would be the average distance it moves before breaking apart. But how do I calculate that?

I remember something about particle physics lifetimes. The mean lifetime (tau) is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh right, the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for particles, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I think the actual formula might be τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width of the resonance, and τ is the proper lifetime of the particle. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have τ, the lifetime, I can find the decay length. Decay length L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ, right? So L = v * τ. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the particle. But if the meson is moving, we have to consider its velocity.

Wait, but the meson is produced with a certain energy. So I need to find its velocity based on that energy. How's that done?

The production energy E_X is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so the kinetic energy is E_X minus the rest mass energy. But wait, no, E_X is the total energy, right? Because in high-energy physics, when they say energy, it's often the total energy.
