Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let's break it down.

First, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, I guess the first thing I should do is normalize this state because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, and we need the state to be a unit vector.

Wait, how do you normalize a state? Oh right, you take the inner product of the state with itself and set it to 1. So, |alpha> is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the inner product would be the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. Let me compute each modulus squared.

For the first term, |1+i|² is (1² + 1²) = 2.
For the second term, |2 - i|² is (2² + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5.
So the total squared modulus is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].

Next, the operator in question has a matrix A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because the spin states are up and down, which are two states. So let's write out matrix A.

Since it's a 2x2 matrix, A would look like this:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when i≠j, the element is hbar/2. So the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. Oh, right, so that's a 2x2 matrix with off-diagonal elements and zeros on the diagonal.

Hmm, what kind of operator is this? Oh wait, this looks familiar. This is similar to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x because scaling by a constant doesn't change the eigenstates. The eigenstates of σ_x are the superpositions (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? And their corresponding eigenvalues are +1 and -1 multiplied by hbar/2.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of the operator A. So the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x, just scaled. So when the question says "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix is A", those eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> -|down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates |+x> and |-x> and then square the coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the inner product between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A, then square the absolute value to get the probabilities.

Let me write down the eigenstates:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>) / sqrt(2)

So, the coefficients for |+x> and |-x> in the expansion of |alpha> are the inner products < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

Let me compute them.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ]

So, the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) < +x | up > + (2 -i) < +x | down > ]

Since < +x | up > is 1/sqrt(2) and < +x | down > is 1/sqrt(2), because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, putting it together:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= (1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Simplify inside the brackets: 1 + 2 =3, i -i=0. So 3.

So this becomes 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (3^2)/(14) )=9/14 ≈ 0.642857... So that's roughly 64.28%.

Wait, but what about the other inner product? Let's compute < -x | alpha >.

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) < -x | up > + (2 -i) < -x | down > ]

< -x | up > is 1/sqrt(2), and < -x | down > is -1/sqrt(2), since |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1/sqrt(2))
