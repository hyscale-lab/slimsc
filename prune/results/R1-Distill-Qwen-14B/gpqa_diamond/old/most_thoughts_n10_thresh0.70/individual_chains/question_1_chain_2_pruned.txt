Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because if ΔE is much larger than the uncertainties, the two levels are well-separated and distinguishable. Alternatively, it might just need to be larger than the individual uncertainties, but I think the usual approach is to require that the energy resolution is better than the spacing. 

Wait, but the energy resolution ΔE for the system would be determined by the time uncertainty of the measurement. Alternatively, perhaps here each state's uncertainty is considered, and the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the sum. Hmm, maybe I should think about the energy resolution needed to distinguish between two states. 

If two states have energies E1 and E2, with uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the separation between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to ensure they don't overlap. Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties. Wait, but actually, when you have two states, each with their own uncertainties, the combined uncertainty when measuring their separation would be the sum of their individual uncertainties, I think. 

So for the energy difference ΔE, to be resolvable, it needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Let's say you have two states with energies E1 and E2. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1. But each has their own uncertainty. So the total uncertainty in
