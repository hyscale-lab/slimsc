Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about the para-isomer yield in electrophilic substitution reactions when certain substituents are present on a benzene ring. Substances 1 to 6 are different benzene derivatives, and they undergo bromination with excess Br2. We need to arrange them in increasing order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Hmm, I remember that substituents on a benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is electron-donating or electron-withdrawing. Electron-donating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2) are strong activating groups and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. On the other hand, electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2, -COOH) are deactivating and typically direct to meta positions.

Wait, but some groups have different directing effects. For example, nitro groups (-NO2) are strong meta directors because they are deactivating and meta-directing. Similarly, carbonyl groups like ketones or esters (like -COO-) are also meta directors since they are deactivating.

So, the para-isomer's yield depends on how strongly the substituent directs the incoming Br+ to the para position. If a substituent is a strong ortho/para director, then the para product will be major. But if it's a meta director, para product won't form much.

Looking at each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when brominated, the para position is a major product. So the para-isomer's weight fraction would be high.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: This is a phenyl ester, like ethyl benzoate. The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, so it's deactivating and meta-directing. So the incoming Br would go to meta positions, not para. So para-isomer's yield is low.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. The Cl is an ortho/para director because it's an electron-withdrawing, but activating group? Wait, no. Wait, Cl is actually a deactivating group because of its electronegativity, but it's ortho/para directing because it's a weakly deactivating (like -I effect) but also can donate through resonance (but not as strong as activating groups). So for Cl, the substitution occurs primarily at ortho and para, but since it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive than benzene. But in bromination, which is an electrophilic substitution, the substituent directs the attack. So Cl is ortho/para director. So para product is major.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in some cases, chlorobenzene has more ortho products than para. Because when I think about the substituent, it's more activating in ortho than para? Or maybe in the case of a substituent that is ortho/para directing but deactivating, the para product is still a major product. Hmm, maybe I should think about the relative directing strengths. For example, in nitration, chlorobenzene gives more ortho and para products, with para being more than meta, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the para isomer is a possible major product.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So bromination would occur at meta positions, so para product is not formed much.

5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So para product is a major, but perhaps more so than methyl because the ethyl group donates more? Wait, no, the effect is similar; both methyl and ethyl are activating and o/p directors. Wait, but in reality, when the substituent is a bulky group, the para position might be more favored because ortho substitution is hindered by steric effects. Wait, but ethyl is a larger group than methyl. So in ethylbenzene, the ortho positions are more hindered, so the para isomer might be more predominant. So perhaps substance 5 has a higher para yield than 1.

6) C6H5-COOH: Phenylacetic acid? No, wait. C6H5-COOH is benzoic acid. The substituent is a -COOH group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So para product is low.

Wait, but wait, the -COOH group is a strong deactivating group. So in bromination, the ring is less reactive, and the substituent directs to meta. So para product is minimal.

So now, let's list each substance and the substituent's directing effect on the para product's yield.

1) Toluene (methyl): o/p-directing, activating. Para is major.

2) Ethyl benzoate (COOEt): meta-directing. Para is minor.

3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): o/p-directing, but deactivating. So para is major, but perhaps less than toluene or ethylbenzene.

Wait, but chlorobenzene: I think that in electrophilic substitution, Cl is a meta director? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, substituents can be classified as activating (directing ortho/para) or deactivating (directing meta). The substituent's nature (electron-donating or withdrawing) determines this.

- Electron-donating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3) are activating and o/p directors.

- Electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, -SO3H) are deactivating and meta directors.

Wait, but Cl is an exception. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity) but it's an ortho/para director. Because Cl has a lone pair which can donate into the ring via resonance, making it an ortho/para director despite being deactivating (due to inductive effect). So chlorobenzene is an o/p director. So when Br2 is added in excess, the para product is favored compared to ortho, but wait, no. Wait, for chlorobenzene, the major products are ortho and para. But in some cases, the para isomer might be more predominant because steric hindrance in ortho positions.

Wait, but in toluene, para isomer is more than ortho because the methyl group is small, so both positions are accessible. But in chlorobenzene, which has a larger substituent, perhaps the para product is more favored than the ortho, similar to ethylbenzene.

So for substituent 3 (Cl), para is a major product.

Similarly, substituent 5 (ethyl) is a strong o/p director, and being bulky might lead to more para product.

So let's list the substituents and their expected para yield:

Substance 1: o/p (methyl) → high para.

Substance 2: meta → low para.

Substance 3: o/p (Cl) → high para.

Substance 4: meta (NO2) → low para.

Substance 5: o/p (ethyl) → high para.

Substance 6: meta (COOH) → low para.

Wait, but in the case of substituents that are o/p directors, the para product is high. Let's think about the relative strengths.

Wait, perhaps the order of activating strength affects the position. For example, more activating groups (like -NH2) are more strongly activating than -CH3. So the more activating the substituent, the more likely the para product.

Wait, but for bromination, which substituents are on the benzene ring and how they activate or deactivate the ring affects the reactivity. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, not the overall yield.

So, the key is to find the percentage of para-isomer formed for each substituent.

So, let's think about each substituent:

1) Toluene (methyl): o/p-directing. Since it's activating, the ring is more reactive. The major products are o and p. But in bromination, due to steric effects, the para is more favored than ortho. So para is the major product. So the weight fraction of para would be higher than 50%? Well, in bromination, toluene gives about 58% para, 38% ortho, and 4% meta. So para is major.

3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): o/p director. It is deactivating, so the ring isn't as reactive. Meta is a minor product. However, in the substitution, the para product is major. The ortho product is less favored due to Cl being bulky? Or is it more about the activating effect. Wait, Cl is a meta director? No, earlier I thought Cl is o/p but deactivating. So the para product would be major, but perhaps less so than toluene.

Wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify. For chlorobenzene, the substituent is Cl, which is ortho/para directing because it has a lone pair that can donate into the ring (resonance), even though the inductive effect is electron-withdrawing. So when chlorobenzene undergoes bromination, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene, but more than ortho? Or is ortho more favored?

Wait, no. For chlorobenzene, the major products are o and p. But ortho tends to be more substituted due to the resonance effect. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up an example. From what I recall, chlorobenzene on bromination gives para as the major product because the ortho product is disfavored due to steric hindrance. Because the Cl is ortho/para directing, but when the substituent is in the ortho position, it's too close. So para is more favored, but I'm not sure about the exact percentages. Alternatively, perhaps chlorobenzene's bromination gives a higher ortho product than para.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the relative rates. For substituents that are o/p directors, which is more favored: ortho or para.

In general, when the substituent is an o/p director and not sterically hindered, the para product tends to be more favored because the ortho positions are more hindered. For example, toluene: methyl is small, so both o and p are possible. But the para is more favored because it's easier to attack without steric issues. So in toluene, the para product is about 58%, ortho 38%, and the rest meta.

For chlorobenzene, the substituent is a larger atom (Cl). So the ortho positions would be more hindered, leading to para being more favored. So perhaps chlorobenzene's para product is higher than toluene's.

Wait, but chlorobenzene is a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs Br to o and p.

Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups lead to more para because the ring is more reactive, but the substituent's directing is more important.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's activating or deactivating nature affects the overall reactivity but not the position. So, the main thing is whether substituent is o/p or meta.

So for this problem, the order of para-isomer's weight fraction would be determined by the substituent's directing effect. So, substituents that are o/p directors will have a higher para yield, and meta directors will have a lower para yield.

So, arrange the substituents based on the tendency to form para isomer:

Substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors, so their para yields are higher.

Substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para yields are lower.

So the substances with substituents 1,3,5 will have higher para yields than those with 2,4,6.

Now, among 1,3,5, which has the lowest para yield? And among 2,4,6, which has the highest para yield (but still lower than the o/p group ones).

Wait, but the question is about increasing order of para-isomer yield.

So the order would be: the substances with meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para yields, and the o/p directors (1,3,5) have higher.

Now, among the meta directors, which one has the highest para yield?

Wait, but wait, the meta directors will result in the least para product. So their para yield is low. Among the meta directors, perhaps the strongest meta directors have even lower para yields.

So, let's think:

Substituent 4 is -NO2, which is a strong deactivating, strong meta director. So para yield is very low.

Substituent 6 is -COOH, another strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So para yield is low.

Substituent 2 is -COOEt (ester group). Also a meta director but perhaps less strong than nitro and COOH? Or is it similar? Hmm. Or perhaps it's similar in strength. So for these meta directors, the order of para yield is 2 < 4 <6? Or 4 < 6 <2?

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the strength of the substituents.

The order of electron-withdrawing strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR (ester). Because nitro is a stronger deactivating group than carboxylic acid, which is stronger than esters. So, substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivating, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

So for the meta directors, their para yield would be in the order: 2 (highest) >6>4 (lowest). Because the stronger the meta director, the less the para product is formed. So 4 has lower para yield than 6, which in turn is lower than 2.

Wait, no. Wait, for meta directors, all the substituents in 2,4,6 are meta directors, so the para yield is low regardless. So within these, how much para is formed?

Wait, the meta directors cannot form para isomers, but some may form a small amount. Alternatively, perhaps the para isomer is not formed at all. But that's not possible because the substituent might allow for some para product.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it another way. For each substituent:

- The o/p directors (1,3,5) will have higher para yields.

- The meta directors (2,4,6) will have lower para yields.

So for the meta directors, their para yields are lower than the o/p directors. So when arranging from least to most para yield, the meta directors come first, followed by o/p directors.

Wait, but the question is about increasing order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the lower para fractions come first.

So the order would start with the meta directors, then the o/p directors.

So, the substituents in order from lowest para yield to highest:

2,4,6 (meta directors) → 1,3,5 (o/p directors).

Wait, but wait, among the o/p directors, which one has the lowest para yield? Because perhaps some substituents are better at directing to para than others.

Wait, the substituents in o/p directors are 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), 5 (ethyl).

Which of these substituents leads to the higher para yield?

Methyl is an activating group, o/p director, and small, so para is more favored. So 1 has high para yield.

Ethyl is a bigger group, so probably para is more favored than ortho (as steric hindrance in ortho is higher). So 5 has high para yield, perhaps higher than 1.

Chlorine is a substituent that is o/p directing but deactivating. So for chlorobenzene, the para product is major but maybe less than ethylbenzene.

So, the order of para yield for o/p directors is 5 (ethyl) >1 (methyl) >3 (Cl). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the actual regiochemistry.

Methyl group is activating, so the ring is reactive, and the para product is major because the substituent is small, allowing for both o and p positions, but p is more favored.

Chlorine is deactivating (but o/p director). So the ring is less reactive, but the para position is still a site of substitution. But perhaps the para product is more than ortho because of steric hindrance (Cl is large).

Ethyl group is activating, o/p director, and larger than methyl. So steric factors would make para more favored than ortho, leading to higher para yield than methyl.

So the order of para yield for o/p directors would be 5 (ethyl) >1 (methyl) >3 (Cl).

Wait, but some sources say that chlorobenzene's bromination gives a majority para product. For example, about 50% para, 40% ortho, and 10% meta? I'm not certain, but perhaps the para yield is quite high for Cl.

Alternatively, maybe for Cl, the para yield is less than for methyl and ethyl.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of activating vs deactivating.

Activating groups (like methyl and ethyl) make the ring more reactive, so bromination occurs more readily, and the para product is a major product.

Deactivating groups (like Cl) make the ring less reactive, but they are o/p directors. So the para product is formed, but perhaps in lower amounts compared to activating groups.

Wait, but the actual percentage of para product depends more on the directing effect than the activating nature. So for example, whether the substituent is o/p or meta is more important in determining if para is formed.

So, the key is that o/p directors have higher para yields, while meta directors have lower.

So, among the substituents:

Substituent 1 (methyl): o/p, activating → high para.

Substituent 3 (Cl): o/p, deactivating → high para, but perhaps less than 1 and 5.

Substituent 5 (ethyl): o/p, activating → high para, perhaps higher than 1.

Substituent 2 (COOEt): meta → low para.

Substituent 4 (NO2): meta → very low para.

Substituent 6 (COOH): meta → low para.

So the order of increasing para yield is:

The meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para yields than o/p directors (1,3,5).

So the order would start with the meta directors, then the o/p directors.

Within the meta directors, which one has the highest para yield? Let's see, substituent 2 (COOEt) is a meta director. How does its para yield compare with substituents 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH)?

Since substituent 4 is a stronger deactivating group, it would have a lower para yield than substituent 6, which is weaker than 4 but stronger than 2. So the para yields would be in the order 2 >6>4.

Wait, no. Wait, if substituent is a stronger deactivating and meta director, does that mean it produces even less para product?

Yes, because stronger deactivating groups make the ring less reactive, so even less para substitution. Wait, but the para substitution depends on the directing effect, not the reactivity of the ring.

Wait, no. The ring's reactivity affects the rate of reaction but not the position. So the para product's yield is more about the directing effect. For meta directors, all of them have low para yields, but perhaps substituents with weaker deactivation have higher para yields (as in, less deactivation means the ring is more reactive, but still meta-directed).

Wait, but if a substituent is a strong deactivating group (like NO2), then the ring is less reactive. So the reaction might be slower, but the position is dictated by the substituent.

Hmm, perhaps the para yield is about the relative strength of the substituent's directing effect, regardless of the ring's reactivity. So the substituent's ability to direct to meta is what matters, not the reactivity.

Thus, for the meta directors, their para yields are low, but which is higher between 2,4,6?

Substituent 2: COOEt (ester) → moderate deactivating.

Substituent 4: NO2 → strong deactivating.

Substituent 6: COOH → strong deactivating.

So substituent 2 is less deactivating than 4 and 6. So when it comes to meta directors, substituent 2 would have a higher para yield than 4 and 6.

Wait, but how does the strength of the substituent affect the para yield? Since they are all meta directors, their para yields are all low, but substituent 2 (weaker deactivating) might have a higher para yield than 4 and 6.

So the order among meta directors is 2 >6>4.

Now, among the o/p directors, the substituents are 1 (methyl),3 (Cl),5 (ethyl).

Which o/p director has the lowest para yield? Let's see:

Substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating o/p director. So the ring is less reactive, and even though o/p is directed, perhaps the para yield is lower than for activating groups.

Substituent 1 (methyl) is activating → high para.

Substituent 5 (ethyl) is activating and larger, so even higher para.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the order is 5 >1 >3.

So putting it all together:

The order from least to most para yield would be:

Substituents with meta directors: 4 <6 <2.

Substituents with o/p directors:3 <1 <5.

So the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, according to my reasoning, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option C says 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So that's 4,6,2,1,5,3.

But according to me, the o/p directors are 1,3,5, with 5 having the highest para yield, followed by 1, then 3.

So the order after 4,6,2 would be 3 (Cl), 1 (methyl), 5 (ethyl).

So the order would be 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Wait, but looking back, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has higher para yield than substituent 1 (methyl).

Wait, no. Methyl is a strong activating group and o/p director, so para product is major.

Cl is a deactivating o/p director, so the para product is still major, but perhaps less than methyl.

So the order of o/p directors would be 5 (ethyl) >1 (methyl) >3 (Cl).

So putting it all together:

Meta directors: 4 <6 <2.

O/p directors:3 <1 <5.

So the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No, because that ends with 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the meta directors are 4,6,2 in order of increasing para yield. So 4 has the lowest, then 6, then 2.

The o/p directors are 3 (Cl), 1 (methyl), 5 (ethyl).

So the full order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So it's 4,6,2,1,5,3.

But according to our analysis, after 2, the o/p directors start, which are 3,1,5.

So in the overall order, after 4,6,2, the next is 3, then 1, then 5.

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Hmm, none of the options exactly match the order 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the o/p director order.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para yield than substituent 1 (methyl). I thought that substituents that are activating (like methyl) have higher para yields, but maybe Cl's deactivating effect reduces its para yield.

Wait, but Cl is an o/p director but deactivating. So in bromination, the ring is less reactive, but the para product is still formed. But how does this compare to substituents that are activating?

Alternatively, perhaps the para yield for Cl is higher than that for methyl, which would change the order.

Wait, no. Because the activating groups are better at directing and making the ring more reactive, I think the para yield would be higher for activating substituents than deactivating o/p directors.

So substituent 1 (methyl) would have a higher para yield than 3 (Cl).

So the o/p director order is 5 (ethyl) >1 (methyl) >3 (Cl).

Thus, the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking again at the options, none exactly match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the meta director order.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) has a lower para yield than 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH). No, that can't be because 2 is a weaker deactivating group than 4 and 6.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the para yields as:

Meta directors: 4 <6 <2 (because 2 is the least deactivating, so highest para yield among meta directors).

O/p directors:3 <1 <5.

So the full order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, which option has 4 first, then 6, then 2, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So 4,6,2,1,5,3. No, our order is 4,6,2,3,1,5.

So none of the options have this exact order. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the o/p order.

Wait, maybe substituent 5 (ethyl) is less bulky than I thought, leading to similar para yield as methyl. Or perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para yield than substituent 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <3 <5.

Wait, but that doesn't fit any option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C) 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Hmm, our analysis suggests that after 2 comes 3, but option C goes 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So according to that, 5 is higher than 3, which aligns with our o/p director order.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the substituents in the o/p directors have the following order of para yield:

5 (ethyl) >1 (methyl) >3 (Cl).

Thus, in the overall order:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Looking at the options, this would be 4<6<2<3<1<5. None of the options match that exactly.

Wait, the options are:

A)4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

So none of the options match my conclusion. But perhaps I made a mistake in the o/p director order.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para yield than substituent 5 (ethyl). Because Cl is an o/p director, and perhaps the ring's reactivity is not as high as ethyl, but the para yield is higher than ethyl's.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Reactivity affects the overall reaction rate, not the position. So if Cl is an o/p director, the para product is formed, but the ring's less reactive. So perhaps the para yield is lower than that of ethylbenzene.

So substituent 5 (ethyl) has higher para yield than 1 (methyl) and 3 (Cl).

So the order among o/p directors is 5 >1 >3.

So the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have that. So what's wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So according to this, substituent 5 is higher than 1, which aligns with our analysis. But substituent 3 is after 5, which would mean substituent 3 has lower para yield than 5, which is correct. But substituent 3 (Cl) has higher para yield than substituent 1 (methyl)? No, because methyl is activating, so higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me make a table.

Substance | Substituent | Director | para yield (relative)
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | CH3 | o/p | high (activating)
2 | COOEt | meta | low
3 | Cl | o/p | high (but deactivating)
4 | NO2 | meta | very low
5 | C2H5 | o/p | high (activating, bulky)
6 | COOH | meta | low

So, for para yield:

Meta directors (2,4,6) have low para yields. Among meta, 4 <6 <2.

O/p directors (1,3,5) have higher para yields. Among o/p, 5 >1 >3.

So the overall order is: 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Wait, that's correct. So the order is 4,6,2,3,1,5.

Looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No, because it ends with 3.

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5. No, because 2 comes after 4 and before 6.

Option D: 3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4. No.

Wait, none of the options fit. Did I make a mistake in the analysis?

Wait, perhaps the para yield of substituent 3 (Cl) is higher than substituent 1 and 5. Because Cl is an o/p director but deactivating, so perhaps the para product is more than in activating groups. No, that can't be right. Activating groups make the ring more reactive, so para product is more likely in higher amounts.

Wait, but the substituent's ability to direct is the main factor, regardless of activating or deactivating. So if a substituent is o/p director, regardless of being activating or deactivating, the para product is major. So for Cl, the para product is major, but the overall reaction is slower due to deactivation.

But the weight fraction of para is not about the reaction rate but the position. So substituent 1 (methyl) would have a higher para yield than Cl.

Hmm. So the order should be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the meta director order.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) has a lower para yield than substituent 6 (COOH). Because COOH is a stronger deactivating group than COOEt.

Wait, but the para yield is about the directing effect, not the activation. So for meta directors, all have low para yields. The order among meta directors would be substituent 2 (COOEt) has higher para yield than 6 (COOH) and 4 (NO2), which has the lowest.

So the order is 4 <6 <2.

So the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Again, looking for this in the options.

Option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I have a mistake.

Alternative approach: Let's think of each substituent's para yield.

Substance 1: CH3 (o/p) → high, about 58% para.

Substance 2: COOEt (meta) → low para, maybe 5% or so.

Substance 3: Cl (o/p) → high para, say 50% (since Cl is less activating, but still o/p).

Substance 4: NO2 (meta) → very low para, maybe 2%.

Substance 5: C2H5 (o/p) → high para, perhaps 60% (due to being bulky and o/p).

Substance 6: COOH (meta) → low para, maybe 3%.

So the percent para would be:

4: 2%,

6: 3%,

2:5%,

3:50%,

1:58%,

5:60%.

Wait, but that can't be because substituent 3 (Cl) would have higher than 50%, perhaps around 70% para.

Wait, perhaps I should look for actual data.

Toluene: para about 58%.

Ethylbenzene: para around 65%.

Chlorobenzene: para about 70%.

Nitrobenzene: meta is major, so para is negligible.

Phenoxybenzene: o/p.

But maybe I'm getting off track. So, based on this, the order of para yields would be:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Which would correspond to 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none exactly match. So perhaps the correct option is C, which is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. But according to my analysis, substituent 3 (Cl) has higher para yield than 1 and 5. So perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) has higher than 1 (methyl), which is correct.

So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Alternatively, maybe substituent 3 (Cl) is after substituent 1 and 5 in the order. So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Hmm, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C. But according to my analysis, 3 comes before 1 and 5 in the order.

Wait, perhaps the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is C, which is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But according to the analysis, substituent 3 has a higher para yield than 1 and 5. So perhaps the correct order should be 4 <6 <2 <1 <3 <5.

But that's not an option either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the o/p director order.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) has the highest para yield, followed by substituent 1 (methyl), followed by 3 (Cl).

So the order after substituent 2 is 3,1,5.

But the options don't have that. 

Hmmm. This is getting a bit too complicated. I think I'll have to go with the best possible option based on the substituents' directing effects.

The meta directors are 2,4,6, with 4 <6 <2.

The o/p directors are 1,3,5, with 3 <1 <5.

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking for this in the options, none match. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But according to my analysis, 3 should come before 1 and 5. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para yield than 1 (methyl). So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

So the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option C.


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in the bromination of the given benzene derivatives, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents:

1. **Substituents and Their Directing Effects**:
   - **Substance 1 (C6H5-CH3)**: Methyl (-CH3) is an electron-donating group, making it an **ortho/para-directing (o/p)** and **activating** group. This leads to a **high para-isomer yield**.
   - **Substance 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5)**: The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, making it a **meta-directing (meta)** and **deactivating** group. This results in a **low para-isomer yield**.
   - **Substance 3 (C6H5-Cl)**: Chlorine (-Cl) is an electron-withdrawing group but still ortho/para-directing due to resonance effects, making it an **o/p-directing (o/p)** but **deactivating** group. The para-isomer yield is **high**, but slightly lower than fully activating groups like -CH3.
   - **Substance 4 (C6H5-NO2)**: The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, making it a **meta-directing (meta)** and **deactivating** group. This results in a **very low para-isomer yield**.
   - **Substance 5 (C6H5-C2H5)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an electron-donating group, making it an **o/p-directing (o/p)** and **activating** group. Due to steric hindrance, the **para-isomer yield is high**, potentially higher than methyl (-CH3).
   - **Substance 6 (C6H5-COOH)**: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is an electron-withdrawing group, making it a **meta-directing (meta)** and **deactivating** group. This results in a **low para-isomer yield**, but slightly higher than -NO2.

2. **Order of Para-Isomer Yield**:
   - **Meta-directing groups** (2, 4, 6) have the lowest para-isomer yields. Among these, the order is **4 < 6 < 2**, as -NO2 is the strongest deactivating group, followed by -COOH, and then -COOEt.
   - **Ortho/para-directing groups** (1, 3, 5) have higher para-isomer yields. Among these, the order is **3 < 1 < 5**, as -Cl is deactivating and less effective than -CH3 and -C2H5.

3. **Final Order**:
   Combining the above, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - **Option A**: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5 (incorrect, as 6 should come before 2).
   - **Option B**: 6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3 (incorrect, as 4 should come before 6).
   - **Option C**: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3 (incorrect, as 3 should come before 1 and 5).
   - **Option D**: 3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4 (incorrect, as 4 is the lowest).

None of the options perfectly match the derived order. However, **Option C** is the closest, as it correctly places 4 < 6 < 2 and 1 < 5, even though it incorrectly places 3 after 1 and 5.

**Answer: C**
