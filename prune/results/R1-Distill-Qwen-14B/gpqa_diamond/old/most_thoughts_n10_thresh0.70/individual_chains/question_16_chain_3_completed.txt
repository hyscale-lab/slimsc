Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually happens when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So I need to check each compound to see if it has any chiral centers or other features that could cause optical activity.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, the structure here is a chloroalkene. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon: on C1, it's Cl, a methyl group, and two hydrogens. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is probably Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So it's Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Let me draw it.

Structure: C1 is Cl, double bond to C2. C2 has a methyl group, and then the rest are CH2? Wait, but butene has four carbons. So it's Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? No, but but-1-ene is four carbons with double bond between 1 and 2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl), then C3 and C4. Wait, but the molecule would be Cl-C=C-CH(CH3)-? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH2- something. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

But the key point is that for optical activity, we need a chiral center. In this compound, are there any chiral centers? Let's see. The molecule is (Z) configuration, which refers to the geometry of the double bond. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are arranged in a certain way. But on C1, we have Cl and two Hs (since it's but-1-ene). Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not the case here. Oh wait, no. The starting compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. So, the structure would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so four carbons. So C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), then C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3. So the groups on C2 are CH3, CH2CH3, and two other substituents. Wait, but is C2 a chiral center?

Wait, C2 is double-bonded to C1, so it's sp² hybridized. So it can't be a chiral center because it's trigonal planar. So no chiral centers here. Also, the molecule is a double bond with (Z) configuration, but that doesn't create a plane of symmetry? Wait, but Z configuration could lead to a stereogenic center if the substituents are arranged correctly. Wait, but I think in this case, since it's a double bond, the substituents are on the same or opposite sides, but the molecule is planar around the double bond. So no chiral centers in this compound. So no optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main part is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So that's a fused ring system. The substituent is a chloromethylene group (Cl-CH2-) attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E). The 'E' likely refers to the configuration around the double bond in the chloromethylene group.

Wait, so the chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-) is attached as a substituent. But wait, the substituent is actually a methylene group (CH2Cl?) or Cl-CH2- attached where? The substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), which would be -CH2Cl attached to position 8. Or wait, chloromethylene is CH2Cl, but as a substituent, perhaps it's part of a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a double bond. So the substituent is =CHCl, perhaps? Or maybe it's a double bond somewhere else.

But regardless, let's think about the molecule. It has a ring system with substituents. The (3aR,7aS) suggests that the molecule has two chiral centers at 3a and 7a positions. So that's two chiral centers. Now, the E configuration on the substituent might refer to a double bond. But regardless, the molecule has chiral centers, so it should exhibit optical activity. But wait, if the substituent's double bond is in E configuration, does that make any of the rings have a plane of symmetry? I think the molecule would have chiral centers regardless, so it's optically active.

But wait, perhaps the substituent is part of a ring and doesn't contribute to chirality. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent's configuration affects the possibility. But for now, I'll assume that the molecule has chiral centers (since the stereodescriptors R and S are given), so it's optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Succinic acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would have methyl groups on the second and third carbons. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group.

Now, looking at each of these carbons. C2 has: CH3, CH(CH3), two other groups... Wait, the structure: C2 is CH(CH3), connected to the two COOH groups on either side? Wait, wait, wait. No, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would have CH(CH3) on C2 and CH(CH3) on C3. So C2 is CH(CH3) connected to the two -CH(CH3) groups and the two oxygen from the COOH groups.

Wait, wait no. Let me clarify. Let's number the succinic acid as:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: COOH

In 2,3-dimethyl, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups, but wait, wait. Each of those carbons has:

- COOH group on one side,
- CH(CH3) on the adjacent carbon,
- and two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. Let me correct. Each middle carbon (C2 and C3) has:

C2: bonded to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups? Wait, no.

Wait, wait, no. Let me structure it correctly.

Structure:

COOH - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

At C2: attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups? No, wait, no.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected as follows:

C2: -CH(CH3) is connected to C1 (carboxylic acid), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two other groups? Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) is connected to two CH(CH3) groups. Wait no, the structure is:

C1: COOH
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: COOH

But C2 is connected to C1, C3, and two CH3 groups? No, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), two CH3 groups, and C3 (which is another CH(CH3)).

Wait, that would make C2 have four substituents: COOH (from C1), two methyl groups (CH3), and the C3 (which is CH(CH3)). Wait, no, C2's substituents are: COOH (from C1), a methyl, another methyl, and the C3 (which is CH(CH3))?

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me structure this properly. Imagine the four carbons:

1: COOH
2: CH(CH3)
3: CH(CH3)
4: COOH

So the structure between 1,2,3,4 is:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle CH(CH3) groups has:

For C2: groups are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), two CH3 groups (from its own substituents)?

Wait, no. The C2 has the following substituents:

- One COOH group (from C1).
- One CH(CH3) group (C3).
- Two methyl groups attached directly to C2.

So the substituents on C2 are: COOH (from C1), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So four substituents? No, wait. Wait, each CH(CH3) is connected to what? The carbon chain is: C1 (COOH) – C2 – C3 – C4 (COOH), with C2 and C3 each having a methyl group.

So for C2:

- One bond to C1 (which is COOH).
- One bond to C3 (which is CH(CH3)).
- Two bonds to methyl groups (CH3).

So the four substituents on C2 are: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3.

Wait, that can't be. Because CH(CH3) is a substituent, but what about the other substituents on C3? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COO- group when deprotonated, but in the acid form, it's -COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So the substituents are:

1. COOH group (from C1)
2. CH(CH3) (from C3)
3. CH3
4. CH3

Wait, that's four groups. So C2 has two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3). So two of the substituents are the same (two methyl groups). So C2 is attached to two methyl groups, so can't be a chiral center because two substituents are same.

Similarly, C3 is attached to two methyl groups, a CH(CH3) from C2, and a COOH from C4. So C3 has substituents: COOH (from C4), CH(CH3) (from C2), and two CH3 groups. Again, two CH3 groups, so not four different substituents. So both C2 and C3 are not chiral centers. So this compound has no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical activity. But wait, the question says (2R,3S) configuration. If the molecule has those configurations, but the substituents are not all different, then the R and S descriptors might not apply. Because for a stereocenter, you need four different groups.

Wait, but wait. If C2 has two methyl groups, then it can't be a chiral center. So the (2R,3S) descriptors are incorrect, which would mean the molecule can't exist in that configuration. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Wait, could the substituents be arranged differently? Let me think again.

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3), connected to each other.

So for C2, the substituents are:

- The two CH(CH3) groups on either side? No, C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. So two CH3 groups, meaning C2 isn't a chiral center. Similarly for C3.

So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Wait, but the question says (2R,3S). If the substituents aren't four different groups, then the R/S configuration can't be assigned because the molecule isn't chiral. So I think this compound isn't optically active.

Hmm, but wait. Maybe the molecule is symmetric and has a plane of symmetry, so even if it has chiral centers, the molecule is achiral. For example, if the two chiral centers are mirror images, leading to an internal plane of symmetry. Let's see: if C2 is R and C3 is S, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

Looking at the structure, C2 and C3 each have two methyl groups, so if the configurations are R and S, perhaps the molecule is meso. Because if the two stereocenters are mirror images, the molecule as a whole is achiral.

Wait, yes. For example, tartaric acid has two stereocenters. If both are R, it's dextrorotatory. If both are S, it's levorotatory. But if one is R and the other S, but with a plane of symmetry, the molecule is meso and not chiral. So in this case, (2R,3S) would make the molecule a meso compound, which is not optically active.

So this compound is meso, so no optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Same structure as the previous compound but with (2R,3R) configuration.

Again, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Same as before, each middle carbon (C2 and C3) has two methyl groups. So substituents on C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), and two CH3. So same as before, two CH3 groups. So C2 isn't a chiral center. Similarly for C3. So the molecule, having (2R,3R) configuration, but since the substituents on each aren't all different, these can't be chiral centers. So no optical activity.

Wait, but wait a minute. If the substituents on each carbon are the same, then the R/S configuration can't be assigned because the molecule isn't chiral. So in this case, the (2R,3R) descriptors may not apply, meaning the molecule isn't chiral. So no optical activity here either.

Wait, but wait again. Let me imagine the molecule. If both chiral centers have the same configuration (R,R), and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. But in this case, the substituents on each carbon are not all different. So, no, the centers can't be chiral centers. So the descriptors R and S are not applicable, so the molecule isn't chiral. So no optical activity.

Hmm, but this is tricky. Because if the substituents on a carbon are all different, it's a chiral center regardless of configuration. But if two substituents are same, it's not. So in this case, because each of the middle carbons has two CH3 groups, they can't be chiral centers. So regardless of the configuration, they aren't chiral. So no optical activity.

Wait, but wait! Another possibility: perhaps the substituents include the carboxylic acid groups. So for C2, the substituents are:

- COOH (C1),
- CH(CH3) (C3),
- two CH3 groups.

Wait, no. Wait, C2 is attached to:

- C1: which is a COOH group,
- C3: which is a CH(CH3),
- and two CH3 groups attached to C2.

So substituents on C2 are:

COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two CH3. So two CH3 groups, which are same, so C2 isn't a chiral center.

So, no optical activity in this compound either.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is a cyclic molecule with a double bond between C3 and C4. The -OH group is on C1. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents: OH on C1, and the double bond between C3 and C4.

Does this molecule have a chiral center? The OH is on C1, which is connected to two other carbons in the ring, one hydrogen, and the OH. So substituents on C1: the ring (three substituents?), no. Let me think. Each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons (the ring structure), and two other substituents. So for C1, the substituents are:

- OH group,
- two adjacent ring carbons,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring is connected to two other ring carbons, one substituent (like OH or a hydrogen), and another substituent (like a CH2 group or another substituent).

Wait, no. Let me imagine cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the ring has six carbons, with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1.

So, C1 has:

- OH,
- C2,
- C6,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. C1 is connected to C2 and C6 (since it's a ring). So each ring carbon has two adjacent ring carbons, and the other two substituents. So for C1, the substituents are:

- OH,
- C2,
- C6,
- and a hydrogen.

So four substituents: OH, two adjacent carbons (as part of the ring), and a hydrogen. So that's four different groups? Wait, the two adjacent carbons are part of the ring. Are they considered the same or different? Wait, no, the substituents are groups attached to the carbon. The ring is a cyclohexene, so the adjacent carbons are part of the ring structure, but on C1, the substituents besides OH and hydrogen are two CH2 groups (if the ring is in a certain conformation), but wait, no.

Wait, in a cyclohexene, the ring is made up of CH2 groups except where the substituents are. So in this case, C1 has OH, C2 (which is CH2), and C6 (which is CH2), and a hydrogen. So substituents on C1 are:

1. OH,
2. C2 (CH2 group),
3. C6 (CH2 group),
4. H.

But C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups. Are they considered the same substituent? Well, in terms of the groups attached to C1, if C2 and C6 are both CH2, then they are same substituents. So C1 would have substituents: OH, CH2 (two times), and H. So two substituents are same (the two CH2). So that makes C1 not a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. The ring might have substituents that make the two adjacent groups different. For example, if C2 is connected to another substituent, like the double bond. Let me think about the structure.

Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, in the ring, C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1 and C3. C3 is double-bonded to C4.

So, from C1's perspective, substituents are:

- OH,
- C2 (which is connected to C3, which is double-bonded to C4),
- C6 (connected to C5 and C1),
- and a hydrogen.

So the substituents on C1 are OH, H, C2, and C6.

But are C2 and C6 different substituents? Because C2 is part of the double bond, while C6 is a single bond. So perhaps the substituent groups are different. Because C2 is connected to a double bond, making it a CH group, whereas C6 is connected to a single bond, making it a CH2 group. So on C1, substituents would be:

- OH,
- H,
- CH (from C2, which is part of a double bond),
- CH2 (from C6, which is a single bond).

So four different substituents. So C1 is a chiral center.

Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has a chiral center, so it's optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
This is a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The configurations are all s.

So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1,3,5. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Each OH is on a carbon that's part of the ring.

Each OH is on a carbon connected to two other ring carbons, and two other substituents (maybe H and another group).

Let me consider each OH-bearing carbon (C1, C3, C5):

For C1: substituents are:

- OH,
- C2,
- C6,
- and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but in cyclohexane, each carbon is CH2. But in this case, each of these carbons has an OH group, so they're CH(OH).

So for C1:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2 or something else?),
- C6 (CH2 or something else),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but if the substituents are:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),
- and a hydrogen.

So substituents on C1: OH, H, and two CH2 groups. So two substituents are same (the CH2 from C2 and C6). So C1 has two same substituents, meaning it's not a chiral center.

Same applies for C3 and C5. Each has OH, H, and two CH2 groups from adjacent carbons. So each of these carbons has two same substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups), making them not chiral centers.

Wait, but wait. Are the substituents on these carbons all different?

Wait, for C1:

Connected to:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2OH?), no, wait, C2 is CH2 only if it's not substituted. Wait, no, the molecule is cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So only C1, C3, C5 have OH groups. The other carbons (C2, C4, C6) are CH2.

So for C1:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- H.

So substituents: OH, H, and two CH2 groups. So two CH2 substituents are same. So C1 is not a chiral center.

Similarly, for C3 and C5. So the molecule, despite having three OH groups, has no chiral centers. So it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there a possibility of axial vs. equatorial positions leading to different substituents? No, because regardless of the conformation, each carbon's substituents are determined by their connections. So in this molecule, each of the three OH-bearing carbons has two identical substituents (CH2 from adjacent carbons), so no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
Structure: butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but longer. Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2COCH3? No, butan-1-one is CH2CH2COCH3? Wait, butanone is either 2-butanone (most common), which is (CH3)2CO. But 1-butanone would be CH2CH2COCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, butan-1-one is CH3CH2COCH3? No, wait, butan-1-one would be CH2=CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Actually, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, which is CH2CH2COCH3? No, perhaps it's better to draw it.

Butan-1-one would have the carbonyl group on the first carbon. So structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, but wait. Butan-1-one is a four-carbon chain with the ketone on the first carbon. So it's O=C-R group.

Wait, but butan-1-one would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2- something? Oh wait, but butanone is 2-butanone (most common), which is (CH3)2CO. So butan-1-one would be (CH2)3CO? No, that would be a four-carbon chain with the ketone on the first carbon. So (CH2)3CO.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be pentan-1-one, not butanone. I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as:

The structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the ketone is on C1. The substituents on C1 are:

- The cyclopentyl group,
- The methyl group (from 3-methyl),
- And two other substituents.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)2CHCO, no. Let me think of butan-1-one as:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-. But that's four carbons in the chain, but the ketone is on the first carbon, making it O=C followed by three CH2 groups and a methyl? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe butan-1-one is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe the structure is (CH2)3CO, but that's four carbons, making it O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be pentan-1-one. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps butanone is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Butan-1-one would be a four-carbon chain with the ketone on C1. So:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the ketone on C1, so the structure would be (cyclopentyl) and (methyl) groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So, the carbonyl carbon is C1, attached to:

- A cyclopentyl group,
- A methyl group,
- And two other substituents.

Wait, but butan-1-one would have four carbons. So the carbonyl is on C1, then there are three more carbons. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's butan-1-one, which is possible. But in this case, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, so substituents are on C1 and C3.

Wait, no. Let me parse the name again. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Butan-1-one: four carbons, ketone on C1.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, no. The substituents are on the carbonyl carbon and on C3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-R, where R is a three-carbon group. So butan-1-one is O=C-CH2CH2CH2-.

But with substituents:

1-cyclopentyl: the cyclopentyl group is attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon).

3-methyl: a methyl group is attached to C3.

Wait, but butan-1-one has four carbons: C1 (carbonyl), C2, C3, C4.

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, but butan-1-one can't have four carbons because that would make it pentan-1-one. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-1-one. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the molecule: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1. The substituents on C1 are cyclopentyl and methyl? No, because the 3-methyl is on C3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So four carbons in the chain, with the ketone on C1.

In this case, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have:

- At C1: a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituents are:

- On C1: a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group (from 3-methyl?).

No, the 3-methyl is on C3. So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-something?

Wait, perhaps:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

But that's four carbons, which would make it butan-1-one.

So the substituents on C1 are:

- Cyclopentyl,
- (CH2) group,
- (CH(CH3)) group,
- and the other (CH2) group.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think in terms of substituents on the carbonyl carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl carbon (C1) is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group, and two other substituents. Wait, but 3-methyl is on C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

But that's a four-carbon chain, so C1 is O=C, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2. But that would make the chain longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)- ?

No, not sure. Maybe I should move on, but I'm worried I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

The carbonyl is at C1, attached to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group. Wait, but that would make it a geminal di-substitution, which might be possible.

Wait, but geminal di-substitution on the carbonyl carbon is possible. So (cyclopentyl) and (methyl) are both attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon). Then, the rest of the chain is CH2 and CH2.

So the structure would be O=C(C5H9)(CH3)CH2CH2? Hmm, perhaps.

But regardless, the key point is whether there's a chiral center in this molecule.

So, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is:

- Double bonded to O,
- Attached to cyclopentyl,
- Attached to methyl,
- And two other substituents (maybe CH2 groups leading to longer chains).

Wait, but if C1 is the carbonyl carbon, it's double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center because it's only bonded to three groups (since double bonds count as one substituent). So C1 can't be a chiral center.

Looking for other chiral centers: perhaps C3.

C3 has a methyl group attached. Let's see what's attached to C3.

If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-..., then C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and the methyl group.

So substituents on C3:

- CH2 group from C2,
- CH2 group from C4,
- CH3,
- and another substituent, which is the rest of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH2 (from C4),
- CH3,
- and a hydrogen?

No, wait, C3 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to C2, C4, methyl, and what else? Wait, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-something, that would have C3 connected to:

- C2 (CH2),
- C4 (CH2),
- CH3,
- and perhaps another CH2 group.

Wait, no, each carbon in the chain after C1 would have two CH2 groups except C3, which has a methyl.

Wait, perhaps C3 is connected to:

- C2 (CH2),
- C4 (CH2),
- CH3,
- and a hydrogen. So four substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H.

So substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, H. Are any of these same? Well, the two CH2 groups are same if they're both attached to their respective CH2 groups. So substituents on C3: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, H.

So substituents are:

1. CH2- (C2),
2. CH2- (C4),
3. CH3,
4. H.

Are any of these the same? The two CH2 groups are from different positions. Are they considered same substituents?

Wait, substituents are the groups attached to the carbon. If the two CH2 groups are part of the same chain, like in a straight chain, then they might be the same. For example, if the molecule is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and CH3, and H.

In this case, substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH2 (from C4),
- CH3,
- H.

So, are the two CH2 groups different? Because one is connected to C2 and the other to C4. So perhaps they are different substituents because their neighboring groups are different.

Wait, but for determining if a carbon is a chiral center, the four substituents must be different. So if the two CH2 groups are attached to different parts of the molecule, they could be considered different.

But wait, if the two CH2 groups are identical in structure, perhaps they are considered same substituents.

In a straight chain like O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, the substituents on C3 are:

- CH2- (from C2, which is connected to C1),
- CH2- (from C4, which is connected to C5),
- CH3,
- H.

So, if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the two CH2 groups are same. For instance, if the structure is symmetric around C3, then the substituents would be same on either side. But in this case, the substituents on either side (C2 and C4) are CH2, but they're attached to different parts of the molecule.

I think the substituents on C3 would be:

- One CH2 (from C2, which is connected to the carbonyl),
- One CH2 (from C4, which is connected to the end of the chain),
- CH3,
- H.

So substituents are CH2-(C2), CH2-(C4), CH3, H. Are any of these same? The two CH2 groups are attached to different positions, so perhaps they are different substituents. Hence, C3 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are:

1. CH2-CO (from C2),
2. CH2-CH2 (from C4),
3. CH3,
4. H.

So they are all different substituents. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center, making it optically active.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the substituents on C3 are:

- One CH2 group leading to the carbonyl group,
- Another CH2 group leading to the end CH3,
- CH3,
- H.

So:

Group 1: CH2-CO (from C2),

Group 2: CH2-CH2CH3 (from C4),

Group 3: CH3,

Group 4: H.

So all four are different. So yes, C3 would be a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

So, to recap the compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Not optically active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers. Optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound. Not optically active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not chiral. Not optically active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Has a chiral center. Optically active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No chiral centers. Not optically active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Has a chiral center (C3). Optically active.

Now counting the optically active compounds:

Compounds 2, 5, and 7 are active. So that's three. Wait, but I thought compound 2 was active, 5 is active, 7 is active. So three.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-... has chiral centers at 3a and 7a. So two chiral centers. So the molecule is chiral. So yes, optically active.

Compound 5: chiral center. Active.

Compound 7: chiral center. Active.

So that's three compounds that are optically active.

Wait, but no, looking back. The options are: A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

Wait, did I miss any?

Let me recount:

1. No
2. Yes (1)
3. No
4. No
5. Yes (2)
6. No
7. Yes (3)

So total of three. So the answer should be B)3.

Wait, but I thought there were four. Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, compound 7: is that the only one with a chiral center? Let me think again.

In 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to two CH2 groups, a methyl, and a hydrogen. So four different substituents. So yes, chiral. So three in total.

So the correct answer is option B)3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other features that enable optical activity. Optical activity arises when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other structural features that prevent superimposability of the molecule on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl, H, H, and C2 (sp² hybridized). Since C1 is sp² hybridized and part of a double bond, it cannot be a chiral center. Similarly, C2 is also sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule lacks chiral centers and is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound contains a fused ring system with stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS). These indicate the presence of chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a. Since the molecule has chiral centers, it is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. In this compound, the middle carbons (C2 and C3) each have two methyl groups, a carboxylic acid group, and a hydrogen. Since both carbons have two identical methyl groups, they are not chiral centers. The molecule is a meso compound (due to symmetry) and is not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the (2R,3S) isomer, the middle carbons (C2 and C3) each have two methyl groups, a carboxylic acid group, and a hydrogen. Again, the two methyl groups on each carbon make them non-chiral. The molecule is not optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents on C1 are OH, H, and two different carbons (C2 and C6). Since C1 has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. The molecule is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexane ring with -OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these carbons is bonded to two identical CH2 groups, making them non-chiral. The molecule lacks chiral centers and is not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound has a ketone group on C1, a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group on C3, and a CH2 group on C2 and C4. The substituents on C3 are CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. Since all four substituents are different, C3 is a chiral center. The molecule is optically active.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**, and **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**. This gives a total of **3 optically active compounds**.
