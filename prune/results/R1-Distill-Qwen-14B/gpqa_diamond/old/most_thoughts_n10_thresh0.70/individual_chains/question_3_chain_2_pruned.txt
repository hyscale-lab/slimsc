Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. And the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. We need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on identical systems. So in this case, we're looking for ⟨10σz +5σx⟩.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So I need to compute this for each part and then sum them.

Let me break it down. The operator is a sum of two terms: 10σz and 5σx. So the expectation value is the sum of the expectation values of each term. So ⟨10σz⟩ + ⟨5σx⟩. Which can be written as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That might make it easier.

Now, let's handle each part separately.

First, σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of σz in this state would be the probability of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

What are the eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩? Oh right, σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

So the state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me write the probabilities. The probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is |√3/2|^2 = (3/4) → 0.75.

So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ would be (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

Now the second term: σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. I think σx doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. So I'll need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Wait, σx is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So, perhaps it's easier to write the state in vector form and compute the expectation value.

Wait, ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me represent this as a vector. |↑⟩ is typically (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ would be (0.5, √3/2). Let me confirm that magnitude: (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So it's a normalized state, which makes sense.

So the vector is [0.5, √3/2]. Now, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, since σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], then the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ.

So let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]
