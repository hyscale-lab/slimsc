Okay, I'm going to try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a genetic construct and why a certain fluorescent signal isn't showing up when the mice are visualized.

Alright, let's start by understanding the setup. The experiment involves a ligand-receptor pair initially found in neural crest cells. The researchers are looking into their developmental fate by creating a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. 

So, the vector has two coding sequences: the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and before the receptor, there's an IRES element. 

Wait, bicistronic vectors usually have two ORFs, and IRES elements are used to allow internal ribosome entry, which can drive the expression of the second gene in a polycistronic mRNA. But here, the ligand and receptor are separate, each with their own expression elements. 

Looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, I think this is using a system where Cre recombinase can excise the stop cassettes. Oh, right, the LoxP and Lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. So, if Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which makes sense as a loading control. So, the expression is working at the protein level.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed this with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and Cre is used for recombination in specific cells. So, the Cre will excise the stop cassettes in cells where SOX10 is expressed, probably the neural crest derivatives.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal. They expected green (eGFP) but don't see it. So, why is eGFP not being expressed?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how that affects the expression here. The eGFP should light up when the receptor is expressed. So maybe not A.

B) Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If eGFP isn't getting secreted or to the cell surface, you wouldn't see the fluorescent signal. But eGFP is a reporter for expression, so if it's stuck, maybe it's not expressed. But why wouldn't the Western blot show it? Because Western blot detects the protein regardless of its location. Oh wait, the Western blot uses total proteins, so the presence would be detected. So if the construct is stuck in the Golgi, the protein would still be present in the cell, so the Western would show a band. But in the live mouse, the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce because it's not on the surface. But the question says the blot shows signals proportional to actin, implying that both mCherry and eGFP would be expressed. Hmm, but I'm not sure. The question says they used antibodies for overexpressed proteins, but maybe the eGFP wasn't overexpressed? Or perhaps the construct isn't being expressed at all. Not sure about this option yet.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so probably enhancers aren't an issue. Also, the IRES is for the receptor. If the enhancer was missing, perhaps neither would be expressed. But the Western blot showed signals, so the promoter must be working. So maybe C is not the right option.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, that's a possibility. If the ORF is not correctly in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed properly. But wait, the vector is designed so that the receptor is at the 3' end, with the IRES, and then the eGFP. So the eGFP is under the control of the IRES, which is after the receptor ORF. So, the eGFP should be expressed as a separate ORF. So, if the eGFP isn't in frame, perhaps it's not being translated correctly. But how would that affect expression?

Wait, the setup uses stop cassettes. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but between them is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So, without Cre, the ligand ORF is terminated, and mCherry is not expressed. Similarly, the receptor is before the eGFP, but with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, in the presence of Cre, which recognizes loxP and lox2272 sites, the stop cassettes are excised. 

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct where both ORFs
