Okay, so I'm trying to understand this nuclear decay problem. Let's see what the question says.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So two nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's and emit two E and two V particles. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Now, the variant changes this by emitting one exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V's. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E particles changes in this new scenario.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decays, the energy spectrum of emitted particles depends on whether they're part of a two-body or multi-body decay. Oh right, in beta decay, for example, when a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino, the electron's energy is continuous because it's a three-body decay. But when you have two electrons emitted, like in some other decay, maybe their energy spectrum changes.

Wait, in the original case, we have two E particles and two V particles. So it's a four-body decay. But wait, no, actually, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So it's a four-body decay? Or wait, the initial is two particles (2A), and the products are 2B, 2E, 2V. So that's a total of 2+2+2=6 particles? Or wait, no, maybe 2E and 2V are two each, so 4 particles in total? Wait, perhaps 2E and 2V are two each, so 2 particles of E and 2 of V.

But regardless, in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. So why is that? I think in multi-body decays, especially when more particles are emitted, the energy spectrum tends to be continuous because each particle can carry away a varying amount of energy.

Wait, if the particles are emitted in all possible directions, their energies can vary, leading to a continuous distribution. So for E in the original case, the energy is continuous, which makes sense.

Now, in the variant, the decay emits M instead of two V's. So the products are 2B, 2E, and 1 M. So it's 2+2+1 = 5 particles in total. But wait, the original decay had 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V — that's 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 particles. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the original decay is 2A → 2B + E + V? No, no, the question says 2E and
