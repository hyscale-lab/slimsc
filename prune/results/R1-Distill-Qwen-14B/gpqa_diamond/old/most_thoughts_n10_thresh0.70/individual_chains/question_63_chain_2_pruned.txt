Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. The elements have masses Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I'm trying to remember what that implies about the quantum numbers.

In the rotation-vibration model, each state is characterized by two quantum numbers: the vibrational quantum number v and the rotational quantum number J. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, I think. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next higher energy state, but how exactly?

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the molecule is in the ground state, which is the lowest energy state. To reach the next state with the least energy, the molecule would probably increase either its vibrational or rotational quantum number in the smallest possible way.

But I'm not entirely sure. In quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule can be modeled using the non-rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations. The energy levels for vibration and rotation are quantized. So, the total energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies.

The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either increasing J by 1 or increasing v by 1. But wait, the vibrational energy is quantized as (v + 1/2) ħw, and the rotational energy is something like (J(J+1)ħ²) / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Now, the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than the rotational ones. Wait, no, actually, the spacing between vibrational levels is ħw, which for w=4e14 rad/s is about (6.626e-34 Js)(4e14) ≈ 2.65e-19 J. For rotational levels, the spacing is on the order of (ħ
