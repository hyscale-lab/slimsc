Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with some underlying symmetries.

The question is about which symmetries must all operators respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so any effective theory derived from it should preserve that. Operators in SMEFT are constructed by adding terms that are consistent with the SM, so Lorentz symmetry must hold. So point 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in the SMEFT, the operators are built into the Lagrangian with higher dimensions, which includes terms that may not respect strict translation invariance. For example, operators with higher derivatives or higher fields might break translation symmetry. But wait, no, SMEFT by construction maintains renormalizability and respects the symmetries of the SM. Oh, but the SM includes Poincare symmetry, so all SMEFT operators must respect that. Because the SM's Lagrangian is Poincare invariant, SMEFT operators are built respecting that as well. Or do they? Because higher-dimension operators are added to the SM Lagrangian, which already respects Poincare, so the sum must also respect it. So point 2, Poincare, is also a symmetry that must be respected.

Hmm, but wait, are all higher-dimension operators Poincare-invariant? I think so. Because the SMEFT is built as an effective theory, it should maintain the same symmetries as the SM. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, about CP symmetry. The SM doesn't necessarily have all CP symmetry. For example, CP violation is present in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have it, the SMEFT doesn't have to preserve it either. So operators in SMEFT might violate CP, depending on what the underlying physics is. So point 3, CP symmetry, is not necessarily required for all operators. So 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry, on the other hand. I remember that the Standard Model is CPT symmetric. Because CPT involves charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM has CPT symmetry because it has Lorentz symmetry and certain other properties. Wait, does any Lorentz-invariant theory automatically respect CPT symmetry? Or is that a separate condition?

Wait, a theory that is Lorentz-invariant must be CPT-invariant. Because in special relativity, the combination of Lorentz transformations and CPT can lead to certain invariances. So any operator in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, and because of that, they must also respect CPT symmetry. So point 4, CPT symmetry, is a must.

So putting it together: which symmetries must be respected by all operators? Lorentz (1 yes), Poincare (2 yes), CPT (4 yes). But wait, earlier I thought Poincare is automatically respected if Lorentz is, but maybe not necessarily. Wait, because Poincare includes translations. Do the operators in SMEFT break translational symmetry?

Wait, the operators in SMEFT are constructed as local operators, so they must respect the same symmetries as the SM. Since the SM Lagrangian is translation-invariant, the SMEFT operators must also be translation-invariant. So yes, Poincare symmetry is respected. So points 1, 2, and 4 must be respected.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct option would include 1, 2, and 4. Let me check the options:

Option C is 1,2,4: yes. So the correct answer would be C. But wait, another
