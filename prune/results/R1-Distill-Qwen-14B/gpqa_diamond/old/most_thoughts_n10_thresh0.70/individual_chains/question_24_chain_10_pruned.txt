Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question involves a mixture X which is equimolar of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, give the same hydrocarbon Z, which is a solvent and has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, and mixture X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that substances that decolorize bromine water are usually unsaturated. So, the two liquids in X must be unsaturated, like alkenes or alkynes. But the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. So, maybe each has a single double bond, but not conjugated.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes disproportionation. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, if a molecule has a functional group that can be both oxidized and reduced, like an alkene? Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: what if the two liquids in X are alkenes, and the reaction is a hydrogenation. But wait, no, because the problem says when treated with Pt, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but the product is a mixture Y with two liquids. Oh wait, no, the reaction is a disproportionation, so it's a decomposition reaction where one product is an oxidation and another is a reduction.

Wait, maybe X is a di-substituted alkene, like 1,2-disubstituted, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the two liquids in X are different isomers, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach. Let's think
