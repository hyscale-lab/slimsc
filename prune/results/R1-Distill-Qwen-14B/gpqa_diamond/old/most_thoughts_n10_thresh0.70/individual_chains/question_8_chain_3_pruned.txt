Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that three genes, G1, G2, G3, were identified as candidates for contributing to anthracnose resistance. Knock-out mutants were created for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The key information is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. 

The experiment measures resistance levels. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. The mutants' resistances are as follows:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The question is about drawing conclusions on the gene interactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each making different claims about which gene is a transcription factor, whether genes show pleiotropy or redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If a gene is epistatic to another, it means that its phenotype masks or modifies the phenotype of the other gene. 

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But here, maybe it's more about how the genes interact in their pathways.

Redundancy would be if two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking out both has a more severe effect than each alone.

So, the data shows that when each single mutant is tested:

- g2 has 0% resistance, so it's the most severe. So knocking out G2 completely abolishes resistance. 

- g1 has 75%: so it's less resistant than wild-type but not completely. 

- g3 has 50%: so it's halfway.

Looking at double mutants:

g1g3: 10% (much worse than each alone)
g2g3: 0% (same as g2 alone)
g1g2: 0% (same as g2 alone)

Wait, so when G2 is in a double mutant with any other gene, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes. If G2 is knocked out, then those downstream genes (maybe G1 or G3) aren't expressed, leading to a loss of resistance.

Wait, but let's think about the possible pathways. Suppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Then, if G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to no resistance. 

Looking at the single mutants: g2 has 0% resistance, so without G2, the downstream genes (maybe G1 and G3) aren't expressed, so the plant can't resist the fungus. So G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

Now, what about the other mutants? 

g1 has 75% resistance. So, without G1, the plant is less resistant but still has some resistance. Maybe G1 is part of a pathway that contributes to resistance, but there's another pathway (like G3's pathway) that provides some resistance when G1 is knocked out. 

g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the plant's resistance is halved. 

In double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower. That suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, perhaps additively. If they're both knocked out, almost no resistance remains.

Wait,
