Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. We need to determine its chemical formula from the given data, and the options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll break down each piece of data given.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 is usually O-H stretch, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad. Wait, O-H in alcohols is usually broader, but in carboxylic acids, it's also broad. Could it be a carbonyl group as well? The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amide, but since there's no mention of N, maybe not. The 1650 is a bit lower than 1700, so that could be an conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Or maybe an amide, but again, no N info.

Wait, but 1650 is in the range of conjugated carbonyls. For instance, an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. Or maybe a carbonyl group in an aromatic ring, like in a phenol ester or something. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have an alkene group. That means there's a C=C double bond somewhere.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what could produce a fragment of 45. Common fragments: maybe CH3CO (which would be 43?), but 45 is a bit higher. Wait, let's think in terms of possible molecular ions. 45 is the mass, so the fragment could be something like (CH3)2O (31), but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group (formaldehyde is 30, but that's not 45). Or maybe another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O? Wait, let me calculate. Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So C3H8O: 3*12=36, H8 is 8
