Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

The problem says we have two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So system_1 has a longer period than system_2. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, which I think relates to their orbital periods.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. I remember that in binary systems, the RV variations are due to the Doppler effect as the stars orbit their common center of mass. The amplitude of the velocity is related to the mass of the companion.

Wait, I think the key here is the mass function. The mass function relates the velocities and the orbital period to the masses of the stars. The formula I recall is something like (v1^3 + v2^3) / (P^2) equals some function involving the masses. Or wait, maybe it's the individual velocities.

Wait, no, the mass function for each star in a spectroscopic binary is given by f(M) = (v^3 * P) / (2Ï€ G), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact equation. Alternatively, perhaps the mass ratio plays a role here.

Wait, I remember that in a binary system, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because velocity is inversely proportional to mass when they're orbiting each other (since momentum must be conserved). So if one star has a velocity v1, the other will have v2, and m1*v1 = m2*v2. So the mass ratio m1/m2 = v2/v1.

In system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So let me calculate the mass ratio. m1/m2 = v2/v1 =5/10=0.5. So m1 is 0.5 times m2. Wait but wait, no, because the more massive star would have a lower velocity. So if star A has velocity v1, and star B
