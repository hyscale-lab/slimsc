Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with two-dimensional potentials. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says: A particle with mass m moves in two dimensions, and the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. And I'm supposed to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for a particle in a potential is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. The kinetic part usually involves the Laplacian, and the potential here is given. Since the potential depends on r and θ, maybe it's better to work in polar coordinates.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me try to simplify that expression. Oh, cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. (3/2)k r² * (1/2) = (3/4)k r², and (3/2)k r² * (cos 2θ/2) = (3/4)k r² cos 2θ.

So the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ.

Wait, adding the first two terms: 1/2 + 3/4 is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ.

Hmm, maybe it's better to factor out r². So V(r,θ) = (k r²) [5/4 + 3/4 cos 2θ ].

Wait a minute, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts. So V(r,θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ). Let's see:

V_r(r) is the part that depends only on r, and V_θ(θ) depends only on θ.

In the given expression, the first term is (1/2) k r², which is purely radial. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the second term as (3/4)k r² (1 + cos 2θ), but I think that approach might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe analyze the potential in terms of angular components.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of angular momentum or something. Or maybe it's actually separable in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written as a sum of functions each depending
