Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem has two reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I have to match them with the given options.

First, looking at reaction A: It's 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+ to form product A.

Wait, what's a spiro compound? From what I remember, a spiro compound has two rings connected by a single atom. So spiro[3.5]non means a nine-carbon chain where one carbon is part of both rings, one of size 3 and the other 5. The structure would be something like a bicyclic system with a bridge.

The molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So it has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at position 1. The spiro part is at carbon 1, which is also the alcohol group. There's a double bond at position 5, I think.

The reaction conditions are THF, which is a solvent. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base, and then H+ is probably an acid workup. So, this looks like a deprotonation followed by some kind of reaction.

In such conditions, especially with an alcohol, I'm thinking it's an elimination reaction. When you have an alcohol treated with a strong base like KH, it usually deprotonates to form an alkoxide, which can then undergo elimination, like E2, to form an alkene. But wait, the starting material already has a double bond.

Wait, but the starting molecule is a spiro compound with a vinyl group and an alcohol. So maybe it's going to form a ring via some kind of cyclization. Because the base could deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which could attack some electrophilic center.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Cope elimination? The Cope elimination involves a 1,5-diene and under strong base conditions, it eliminates to form a conjugated diene. Wait, but the structure here is a spiro compound. Let me try to visualize the structure.

The spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol: So, the spiro atom is C1, connected to two rings. One ring is 3-membered (probably a cyclopropane), and the other is a 5-membered ring. Wait, no, wait. Spiro[3.5]non implies that the main chain is 9 carbons, with one carbon being the spiro atom connected to two rings: a 3-membered and a 5-membered. So, the structure is two rings joined at C1. C1 is also where the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) and the hydroxyl group (-OH) are attached.

So, the structure is something like:

- C1 is connected to a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring. The 3-membered ring would be cyclopropane, and the 5-membered would be cyclopentane or similar, but perhaps with a double bond at position 5.

Wait, the molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the non indicates nine carbons, but the spiro structure probably reduces the count because two rings share a carbon.

I think the structure is a nine-carbon chain where C1 is the spiro atom connected to a three-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and a five-membered ring. Hmm, maybe it's a bicyclic system. Alternatively, perhaps it's a spiro compound where one ring is a three-member
