Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So, the conductor is like a bigger sphere with a hole (cavity) inside, but the cavity isn't centered—it's shifted by s units.

Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but then a charge is placed inside the cavity, how does that affect things?

Wait, I think the key here is to consider the method of image charges or the properties of conductors. Oh right, in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So charges reside on the surface. But wait, this conductor has a cavity, so the charges would be induced on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, how does that affect the charges on the conductor? I remember that the conductor being neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal and opposite to q. Then, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the original charge to keep the conductor neutral. Or wait, no—if the conductor was initially neutral, then the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q? Or maybe the other way around? Wait, wait. Let me think.

No, wait. The conductor as a whole is neutral. So the charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have an induced charge of -q, because the charge +q induces opposite charges on the cavity's walls. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance. So, the outer surface has +q. But wait, the problem says the conductor is uncharged. Oh wait, no, the conductor is uncharged, but then you add a charge inside the cavity. So the conductor's inner surface will have -q, and outer surface +q to ensure the conductor remains neutral overall. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surface charges. So, total conductor charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0, which makes sense because the conductor is uncharged.

Wait, but that's when the cavity is concentric with the conductor. In this case, the cavity is not concentric; its center is s away from the conductor's center. So, does that affect the way the charges are induced?

Hmm, I think the induction still happens, but the distribution might be different. But wait, in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. So, the charges rearrange themselves on the surfaces to ensure that.

But for a cavity not at the center, I think the inner surface charge will still be -q, and the outer surface will be +q, but the distribution won't be uniform anymore. But when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the effect of the outer surface charge is like a point charge at the center of the conductor.

Wait, right! Because for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were at the center. So, regardless of the distribution on the outer surface, the external field is as if it's a point charge. So, the outer surface charge of +q would produce an electric field outside the conductor as if it's at the center.

But wait, in this case, the charge placed inside the cavity is +q. So, the inner surface would have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q. So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field would be due to the outer charge, which is +q, located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So, the field at P would be due to the outer surface's +q charge, positioned at the center. So, the distance from P to the center is L, so the electric field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). That would be option B.

But wait, let me think again. The point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's outer surface charge acts as a point charge at the center of the conductor. But the charge inside the cavity is +q, and that affects the inner surface, but the outer is +q, so the net effect is that the conductor's outer surface has +q which determines the external field.

However, wait another thing: the position of the cavity's center is s away from the conductor's center. So, the +q is inside the cavity, which is shifted. Does that affect the outer surface charge distribution? For the purpose of the external field, the outer surface behaves as if it's a point charge, so regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface will have +q because the conductor is neutral. So, for the external field, it's as if you have a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So, the field at P is due to this charge.

But wait, the point P is a distance L from the conductor's center. So, the magnitude of E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That would be option B.

But let me reevaluate. The other options: option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. Hmm, that seems like a combination of l and s, but why would the position of the cavity affect the external field when the conductor's outer charge is symmetric?

Wait, but wait. The way I thought about it, the outer surface's charge is uniform in a sense that, for external points, the field is as if the charge is at the center. But is that always true?

Wait, no, that's only true when the conductor is a solid sphere. If the conductor has a cavity, but the charge distribution on the outer surface is such that it's a shell, then yes, the external field is as if the charge were at the center. Because the outer surface's charge distribution doesn't depend on where the inner charge is placed—only on the total charge.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is a spherical shell. So, any charge on it would produce an external field as if all the charge were at the center. So, regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the outer field is based on the total outer charge, which is +q, and located at the center.

So, the external electric field at point P would be as if it's a point charge +q at the center, at distance L. So, the E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which is option B.

Wait, but let me think about the configuration again. The point P is outside the conductor. The conductor's outer radius is R, and L is greater than R. So, yes, point P is outside. The question is whether the displacement of the cavity affects the E field outside. My conclusion is that it doesn't because the outer surface charge is the same and symmetrically distributed, leading to the same external field as a point charge at the center.

So, the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Setup and Induction**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge $-q$ to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is due to the symmetry of the outer surface charge distribution. Thus, the electric field at a point $P$ outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

3. **Effect of Cavity Position**: The cavity is not concentric with the conductor, as its center is shifted by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center. However, the external electric field is unaffected by the position of the cavity or the inner charge distribution. This is because the outer surface charge acts as a point charge at the center of the conductor, and its field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$.

4. **Magnitude of the Electric Field**: Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ does not apply here, as the external field depends only on the total charge and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field due to the outer surface charge acting as a point charge at the center of the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is not relevant to the external field.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the form $\frac{q}{l^2}$ is similar to Coulomb's law, it does not account for the correct distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
