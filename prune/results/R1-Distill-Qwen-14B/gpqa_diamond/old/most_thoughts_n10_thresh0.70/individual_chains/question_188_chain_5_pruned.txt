Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with specific angles and an interatomic distance. Let's break this down.

Wait, a rhombohedral crystal... right, that's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them aren't 90 degrees. Oh wait, no, I think in a rhombohedral system, the lengths a, b, c are all equal, but the angles can be different. Or wait, sometimes they're all the same too. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait—rhombohedral means that a=b=c, but the angles can vary. So that's the case here. So the lattice is rhombohedral, and all angles are 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance—so the distance between atoms along the edges? Oh right, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a' (the lattice parameter). So in this case, the a, b, c are all 10 Angstrom each because it
