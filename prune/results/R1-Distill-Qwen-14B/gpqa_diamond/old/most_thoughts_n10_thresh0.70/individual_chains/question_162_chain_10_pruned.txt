Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. I remember that the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. So, this looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's got dx and dy terms. But wait, pseudosphere... oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a hyperbolic space.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait a second, the radius in hyperbolic geometry is a bit different. But I'm not sure, let me recall. The area of a sphere (which is a 2-sphere) in 3D is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic sphere, so maybe the area is different.

Wait, but another thought: I think the metric given might be related to hyperbolic space. The general form for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is something like ds² = (dr² + dz²)/sinh²(r) or something like that. Wait no, maybe in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + dθ²), where r is the radial
