Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps given, and some hints, along with multiple-choice options.

Let me break down the problem:

1. **Reaction Steps:**
   - Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
   - Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
   - Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
   - Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

2. **Hints:**
   - Hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
   - Hint b) mentions IR peaks: A has a strong peak ~1750 cm^-1, and E has ~1715 cm^-1.

3. **Options for E:**
   - A) 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one
   - B) 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one
   - C) 4-methylcycloheptan-1-one
   - D) 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one

Okay, let's tackle each part one by one.

**First, understanding the reaction steps:**

- **Step 1: A + HCN → B**
   Hmmm, HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde), adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. Wait, but wait: HCN addition is usually to ketones. So A is likely a ketone, and B would be a cyanohydrin.

- **Step 2: B → C with H2 and Pd (hydrogenation)**
   Hydrogenation of a nitrile (if B is a cyanohydrin) would reduce the nitrile group (-CN) to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait no, hydrogenation of nitriles typically yields amines. Wait, but under H2 and Pd, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to a primary amine, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone group was converted into an alcohol. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, let's think about what B would be. If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which is an addition product where the HCN adds across the carbonyl. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. Then, upon hydrogenation (H2 and Pd), the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. Hydrogenation of nitriles (R-CN) typically gives amines when using H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or Pd. Wait, but let me think: H2 and Pd might be for hydrogenation of triple bonds or other groups. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine. So for example, R-CN → R-CH2-NH2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If B is a nitrile, perhaps from an aldehyde. Wait, but HCN adds to aldehydes as well. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group as substituent. So when B is hydrogenated, the nitrile group (-CN) would be reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-). Wait, but how?

Wait, wait—hydrogenation of nitriles (R-CN) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically
