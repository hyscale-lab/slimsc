Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y which satisfies the eigenvalue equation A_y φ = a φ. The matrix has the form A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix's first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which of the four options (A to D) is correct.

Hmm, right. I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to Pauli matrices. Oh wait, because the intrinsic angular momentum for spin-½ particles is given in terms of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. But here, the setup is a bit different. Let me think.

So the matrix S given is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Wait a second, that looks familiar. The Pauli Y matrix is usually given as:
σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]
So S is exactly the Pauli Y matrix, σ_y.

Now, the operator A_y is given by c times S, which is c σ_y. So A_y = c σ_y. But what is c? The problem states c = h/(4π). Wait, I should check the constants. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the spin angular momentum is (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. But here, c is h/(4π), so let me compute that.

Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ. So h = 2π ħ. Substituting that into c:

c = (2π ħ) / (4π) ) = (2π ħ) / (4π) = (ħ)/2. So c is ħ/2. Oh, wait, wait. Let me recompute that. c = h/(4π), and h is 2πħ, so c = (2πħ)/(4π) =
