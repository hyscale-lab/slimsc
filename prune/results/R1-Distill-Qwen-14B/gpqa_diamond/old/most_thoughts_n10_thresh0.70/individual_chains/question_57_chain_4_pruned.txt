Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question gives me phase shifts for different l values, I think. So, phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, up to δ₄ are provided. The measured values are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively.

Wait, the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Right, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) has real and imaginary parts, and in certain cases, like along the beam direction, φ is 0°, so maybe the expression simplifies.

The formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ, φ) = Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) / (k r) ) P_l(cosθ) ), maybe? Or wait, was it f = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ) )? I'm a little confused here. Oh wait, I think the correct expression is f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1)) ) P_l(cosθ) ). But wait, I'm not sure if that's right.

Wait, no, another approach. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}

But since the question is about the direction along the incident beam, φ would be 0°, so the exponential becomes 1^l, which is 1. So, the expression simplifies to:

f(θ=0, φ=0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(1)

Wait, because cosθ is 1 when θ is 0, right? So
