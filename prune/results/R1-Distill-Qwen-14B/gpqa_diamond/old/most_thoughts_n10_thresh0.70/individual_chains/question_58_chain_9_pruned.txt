Okay, so I've got this physics question here about which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think. I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work, right? But wait, which theories don't need this?

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) QCD, C) QED, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, first I should recall what each of these theories is about. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is the theory of electromagnetism, right? It deals with electrons and photons. I think QED has issues with divergences, like when calculating loop diagrams. So they must use regularization here. Same with Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong force. QCD has things like asymptotic freedom, but I'm pretty sure it also has divergences, so regularization is needed.

What about Superstring Theory? Oh, right, superstring theory is a type of string theory, which aims to unify all the fundamental forces, including gravity. String theories are different because they work at higher energies and don't have the same kind of divergences as point particle theories. Because strings are extended objects, maybe the divergences are tamed somehow. So superstring theory might not require regularization, or at least not in the same way. Or wait, do they still need it? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Classical Electrodynamics (option D) is the non-quantum version. It's a classical theory, so it doesn't deal with quantum divergences. In classical E&M, Maxwell's equations are fine and don't have infinities that need handling. So in that case, classical theories wouldn't require regularization because they don't have the same quantum loop issues. Regularization is a quantum field theory thing.

So the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So which of these is a classical theory? Option D is classical, so it doesn't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. The others are quantum theories and thus probably require it, except maybe superstring theory.

Wait, but superstring theory is a quantum theory. Oh, right, but it's a theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences as QED or QCD. Or does it? I'm a bit confused. Because in string theory, interactions are represented by vertices with higher-order corrections, but perhaps their
