Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, which makes sense because transits are easier to detect when more likely.

So, the given data: both planets have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, P days, Planet_1's is P/3. Wait, no, wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's would be about 33 days. Got it.

Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Wait, so star_1 (hosting Planet_1) is more massive than star_2 (hosting Planet_2), but same radius. Interesting.

The question is about which planet has a higher transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. The formula I recall is something like P = (R_star / a) * (something else?) Or maybe the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) squared divided by something? Wait, no, I think the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - eÂ²))) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1. So it simplifies to R_star/(a) * something else?

Wait, no, I think the approximate probability is given by (R*/a) * (1/ (something)), but maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think. The formula for transit probability is roughly P = (R* / a) * ( (R_p / R*) )^2 )? Hmm, not sure
