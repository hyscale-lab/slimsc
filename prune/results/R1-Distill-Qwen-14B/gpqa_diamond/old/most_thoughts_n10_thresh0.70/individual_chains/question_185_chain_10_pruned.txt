Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the question is asking for the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H, which is given as ε times the dot product of σ and n vectors. I remember that σ represents the Pauli matrices. Let me think about this step by step.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, right? Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product σ·n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of the unit vector n. So σ·n = σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

The Hamiltonian H is ε times this dot product, so H = ε (σ·n). Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this operator. I remember that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. But wait, H is a scaled version of a Pauli matrix combination. So maybe I can find the eigenvalues by considering the properties of σ·n.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the expectation values or the possible outcomes of a spin measurement in the direction of n. Since the spin operator is (ħ/2)σ·n, the eigenvalues of the spin component S·n would be ±ħ/2. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is ε times σ·n. So if I think of H as proportional to the spin operator, maybe the eigenvalues are ± ε multiplied by something.

Wait, let me think about the general case. The operator σ·n is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with a unit vector. The eigenvalues of any such operator should be ±1 because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and the combination here is a sum of their products with components of the unit vector. Since the sum would still have eigenvalues ±1 because when you diagonalize σ·n, it's
