Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, okay. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, it reacts to form acetate ions and water. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. 

First, I think I need to calculate the initial concentrations after dilution. Let me start there.

When we mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution will be (volume1 * concentration1) / total volume. 

So, initial moles of acetic acid = 0.020 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So, the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH at equivalence point = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So, the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question asks about two points: 25% titration and equivalence point. So for 25% titration, it's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer. Because some of the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form acetate ions, and the rest remains as acetic acid. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

But first, let me find the concentrations at 25% titration.

The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. When 2.5 mL (0.0025 L) of 0.1 M NaOH is added, moles of NaOH added = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. 

So, moles of acetic acid reacted = 0.00025 mol. Remaining acetic acid = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed = 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 mL NaOH is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.
Concentration of acetate = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approx 0.005882 M.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])
The pKa is given from Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73 (since log(5.4e4) is about 4.732). Wait, wait, let me calculate that properly.

Wait, wait. Let me compute pKa correctly. Ka = 1.85 × 10^-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that. 

Log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ). Let's compute the ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. Hmm, that's around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. So that's probably the pH at 25% titration.

Now, at the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, producing sodium acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions needs to be calculated. 

At equivalence point, the moles of sodium acetate is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL NaOH (equivalence point) = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 = approx 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. 

Now, using the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. Since Kb is very small, we can approximate [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517, so 5.517 - 6? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3.288e-6 is 3.288 × 1e-6, so the log is log(3.288) + log(1e-6) = 0.517 -6 = -5.483. So pOH is 5.483. Then pH is 14 - 5.483 = 8.517, approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is around 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is (4.26;8.52), which matches our calculations. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait. I should double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in the steps.

Wait, when I calculated the initial dilution, I had 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. So 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol, correct. Then adding 20 mL of water, total volume 40 mL, so 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point is 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH = 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. Correct.

So moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol. Right.

The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL → 0.0425 L. So concentrations are 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M and 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333, which is 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which rounds to 4.25, so 4.26 in option A.

At equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. So 0.001 mol acetate in 50 mL (0.05 L) → 0.02 M. Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10, correct.

So Kb = x² / 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517 so 5.483? Wait wait, 3.288e-6 is 3.288 × 1e-6 → taking log: log(3.288) is 0.517, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.517 -6 = -5.483. So pOH is 5.483 → pH = 14 -5.483=8.517. So 8.52, which is the second value in option A.

So yeah, looks like option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, there are 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid, containing:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.020 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point is reached. The equivalence point requires 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH (calculated as:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at equivalence point} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}.
\]

Thus, at 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forming:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume after adding 2.5 mL of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Acetate}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) \approx 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of sodium acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{Acetate}]} \implies [OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{Acetate}] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
