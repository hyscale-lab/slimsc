Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the Pz operator, ΔPz, for a given quantum state. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), and it's an eigenstate of the Px operator with eigenvalue -ħ.

Wait, the uncertainty principle... right, the uncertainty ΔA for an observable A is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared, then plug them into this formula.

But wait, the system's state is in the eigenstate of Px, not Pz. Hmm, but since the operators Px, Py, Pz are all related to angular momentum, which I think they're talking about here. But in this case, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the given state is expressed in the Pz basis?

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which means the state is written in terms of Pz's eigenstates. So the state vector given is already in the correct basis for Pz. That should make things easier because I can directly work with the components.

So our state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

First, I need to find the expectation value of Pz, which is ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩. Then the expectation value of Pz squared, ⟨ψ| Pz² |ψ⟩. Then compute ΔPz.

Wait, but Pz is a matrix. Let me write down the Pz matrix given:

Pz's matrix is:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

Wait, so Pz is a diagonal matrix. That's helpful because then the expectation value is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the probabilities of each state.

But wait, the state vector is a 3-component vector. Let me index
