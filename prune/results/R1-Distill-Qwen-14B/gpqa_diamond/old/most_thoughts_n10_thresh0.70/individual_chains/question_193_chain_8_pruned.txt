Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, mathematically, I think that means number of stars, let's say N, is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Wait, but how does parallax relate to distance?

I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, but actually, parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d where d is in parsecs.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I think I need to relate the number of stars to distance.

Given N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in: 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. 1/(1/(d^5)) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait wait, no, let's think again. If plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx)^5 = (d)^5. So
