Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which compound it is based on the spectral data provided. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. So I'll start by calculating the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNp. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. Plugging in the numbers: n=9, m=11, x=2, p=1. So (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, or a ring and a double bond, or other combinations. Common structures with this might be a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees, wait no, benzene is 3 degrees—each ring or double bond is a degree. So a benzene ring is three degrees, so maybe that's part of it. Then maybe an amide group or something else.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are likely N-H stretches. But wait, 3420 is usually a broad peak for O-H, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Hmm, wait, but 3325 could be N-H. Or perhaps it's amines or amides. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong band. That often corresponds to carbonyl groups, like esters, amides, or ketones. Since the molecular formula includes O2 and N, it's likely an amide or ester.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's list it out:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, like in an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad singlet could be a NH2 group, but wait, in the IR, the N-H might be from an amide. Alternatively, could it be an OCH2 group? But 4.0 is a bit low for an OCH2. Alternatively, maybe an NH group but not split because it's exchanging or in an amide.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: Quartet typically means coupling with three neighboring protons, but wait, 2H as quartet? Wait, quartet has four peaks, which would mean each proton is coupled to two others. Wait, thinking about splitting. If there are two protons and each is split into a quartet, maybe they're adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, like a -OCH2CH3 group. Wait, but the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, which would correspond to the CH3 in an ethyl group. So maybe the 4.5 ppm quartet is the adjacent CH2 in an ethyl ester group, like OCH2CH3. But wait, the ethyl ester protons are usually split into a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. Wait, but here it's 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe it's an amide-linked ethyl group?

Wait, another thought: the 4.5 quartet (2H) and the 1.2 triplet (3H) could be from a ethyl ester (like OCH2CH3). But wait, the ethyl ester's CH2 would split into a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. But in this NMR, the quartet is at
