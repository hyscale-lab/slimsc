Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the correct compound is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the peak is very broad, it's probably a carboxylic acid because they tend to have broad, strong O-H stretches due to hydrogen bonding. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.

The FTIR also shows a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. In a carboxylic acid, the C=O is usually around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that fits. So the compound must have a -COOH group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So that means there are no double bonds (or at least no protons on double bonds), which rules out any alkenes or similar structures. So the molecule has to be a saturated compound—no double bonds.

The NMR has several signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about possible structures and what their NMR would look like.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like CH3-C-(C2H5)-C-(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, more accurately, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution. Let me draw it.

Wait, all the options have a similar structure. Let me see. All options end with COOH. The main difference is the structure before COOH.

Let me look at each option:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
So here, the central carbons have substituents. Let's see. The central part is -C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-. So each of those carbons has a CH3 and a CH2CH3 perhaps? Wait, no, maybe not. Let me parse it correctly.

Wait, the formula for D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the chain is: the first part is CH3CH2-, then a C connected to H and CH3, then another C connected to H and CH3, then COOH.

Wait, hang on, maybe it's a substituent on each of the two adjacent carbons. So like, CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So that would be a structure where the two middle carbons each have a CH3 group attached.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H
