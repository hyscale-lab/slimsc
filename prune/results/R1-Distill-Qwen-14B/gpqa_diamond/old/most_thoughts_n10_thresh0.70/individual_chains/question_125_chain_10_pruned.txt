Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = ½ m ω² r². Oh wait, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator, right? Because I remember that the harmonic oscillator potential is V(r) = ½ m ω² x² in one dimension, and in three dimensions, it's the same but with r squared instead of just x. So this is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to think about the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, right? Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. I think that for each degree of freedom (x, y, z), the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω for each direction. So the total energy is the sum for each direction. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and adding them gives 3*(1/2) + (n_x + n_y + n_z) ħω. So E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, but sometimes the principal quantum number is introduced as N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh right, yes, so the energy levels are E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So each N corresponds to a certain energy level.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state, first excited, etc. For the ground state, all n_x, n_y, n_z are zero. So N = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would have N=1, so E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited, N=2 → E=(7/2) ħω. Third excited is N=3 → E=(9/2) ħω. So that's the energy part.

So looking at the options, let me check which ones have (9/2) ħω as the energy. Option A has (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. Option C also has (9/2) ħω but only 3 eigenfunctions. The other options don't have the right energy; they have some terms with pi squared and r squared, which doesn't fit the harmonic oscillator formula. So options B and D can probably be dismissed because their energies don't match the form I remember.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, how many distinct states have the same energy E when N=3?

So when N = 3, the possible combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z are all non-negative integers such that n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

I need to find the number of
