Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron annihilating each other and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle meet, they annihilate into photons. Right, so electrons and positrons annihilate into two photons usually. But wait, why two? Oh right, because momentum has to be conserved. So the system must emit photons in opposite directions or something like that. 

The question says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Oh, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is 4 for the electron. And the positron is moving from the right, same horizontal axis, but with a Lorentz factor of 2. So gamma is 2 for the positron. 

After they collide, both annihilate into two photons. The energies of both photons are the same. Interesting. So each photon has equal energy. Also, their directions: one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right but in different vertical directions. Wait, but that means they're both moving in the same general direction, just above and below the horizontal. So the angle between them would be... something less than 180 degrees, but more than 90 perhaps?

I think I need to use conservation of momentum and energy here. So the initial momentum of the system should equal the momentum of the photons after the collision.

But wait, since they're annihilating into two photons, I should probably calculate the total momentum before annihilation and set it equal to the total momentum after.

First, let's find the momenta of the electron and positron before collision.

The electron is moving left, the positron right. Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so along the positive x-direction, perhaps. And the positron is moving from the right, so opposite direction, maybe negative x-direction? Or maybe the electron is moving along the positive x, and the positron is moving along the negative x. Hmm, need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says: electron is moving along the horizontal (x) axis from the left. So let's say the direction is positive x. Positron is moving along the horizontal, from the right. So that would be the negative x direction. So the
