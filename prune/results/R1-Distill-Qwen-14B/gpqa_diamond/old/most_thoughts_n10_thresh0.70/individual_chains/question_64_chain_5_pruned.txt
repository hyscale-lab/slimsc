Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200Â°C without air. Heating the salts without air probably means it's done in a closed container or under inert atmosphere, so no oxygen or moisture is present. As a result, a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through several tubes without cooling.

So the setup is: the gases go through three tubes. Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, it absorbs water. So tube 1 must be measuring the amount of water vapor in the gas mixture. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. That suggests that 3.60 grams of water were absorbed.

Then, the gases pass into tube 2, which contains a Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight of this tube didn't change. Wait, if the solution was in a tube, maybe it's a wash bottle or something. Oh wait, Ca(OH)2 solution is used to absorb CO2. So if the weight didn't change, that means there was no CO2 in the gas mixture. Or maybe the CO2 was already absorbed, but perhaps the tube was set up to collect any CO2. If the weight didn't change, maybe the gas wasn't present, or it was already removed elsewhere.

Next, the gases pass through tube 3, which has red-hot copper. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. Like, maybe sulfur dioxide (SO2) or hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could be oxidized. Oh wait, but red-hot copper would react with H2S, producing CuS or Cu2S perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with CO. Oh wait, another possibility is that the copper is in a reaction with a halogen gas. But wait, the problem states that CuO is formed in tube 3. So CuO is a product. What reacts with copper to form CuO? Probably oxygen. Wait, but the initial setup was heating without air, so maybe the gases include H2O or something else that can oxidize copper when heated. Alternatively, maybe the gas is hydrogen, but I'm not sure. Wait, the reaction of H2 with CuO under heat would produce Cu and water, but that's not what's happening here. Alternatively, SO2 reacting with copper wouldn't produce CuO. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a halogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the gas is H2S, and it's passed over hot copper, maybe it decomposes or reacts. Wait, H2S can react with copper oxide, but at high temperatures, perhaps. Alternatively, if the gas is something like CO, which might react with CuO. Oh wait, CO is a reducing agent and can reduce CuO to Cu, producing CO2. So if the tube
