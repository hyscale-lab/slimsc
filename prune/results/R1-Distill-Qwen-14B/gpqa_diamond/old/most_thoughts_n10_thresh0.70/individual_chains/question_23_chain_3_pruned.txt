Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and see what's going on. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. Hmm, the compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Wait, I need to visualize that structure.

Let me draw it out. The benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The ether is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-O-Ph. Oh wait, but the substituents on the double bond are a bit specific. It's 2,2-dimethyl, so the double bond is between C3 and C2 of the butenyl group. Wait, maybe I should number it again.

But-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait butenyl is four carbons. So numbering starts at the end where the oxygen is attached. So the structure is O-Ph-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? No, wait. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH-O-Ph? No, wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that can't be because but is four carbons. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3? Wait, but the numbering is from the end attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4? But that's impossible because a butenyl group only has four carbons. Wait, the 1-yl position means the substituent is attached at carbon 1. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-O-Ph? No, wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group. So the chain is four carbons, with the double bond at positions 3 and 4, but that's not possible because that would leave only two carbons before the double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2-CH2
