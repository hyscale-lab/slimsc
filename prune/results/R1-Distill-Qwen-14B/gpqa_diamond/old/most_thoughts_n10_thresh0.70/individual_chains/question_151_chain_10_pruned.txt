Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. The observable is represented by the matrix P, and the state of the system is given as a column matrix.

Wait, right. So the state vector is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? So I should probably check if this vector is normalized. To normalize, the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the elements should be 1.

Let me calculate that. The elements are -1, 2, 1. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector isn't normalized. That means I need to normalize it before proceeding.

So the normalized state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state becomes ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, the observable is given by matrix P. Let me write down what P looks like.

P is a 3x3 matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, what's the structure of P? It's a Hermitian matrix because observables are Hermitian. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The transpose of P would swap elements. The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and (2,1) is same, so that's good. The (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is same. The diagonal elements are 0, so their transposes are same. So yes, P is Hermitian. That's correct.

Now, the observable P has possible eigenvalues, which are the possible measurement outcomes. The problem asks for the probability of measuring 0.

Wait, but how do I find the possible eigenvalues of P? I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Hmm, that could be tricky, but maybe I can find them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then find the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize P and find its eigenvalues. Let me think about that.

The matrix P:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, maybe finding eigenvalues can be done by solving det(P - λI) = 0.

So the characteristic equation is determinant of:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ
