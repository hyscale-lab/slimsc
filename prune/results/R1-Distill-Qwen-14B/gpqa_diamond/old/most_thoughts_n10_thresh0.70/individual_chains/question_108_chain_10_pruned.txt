Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question states that we have a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's saying that m is small (so the orbital magnetic quantum number is small). The field is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong field, I think. We need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the term involving the magnetic interaction) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom with a given wavelength λ=0.4861 μm.

Wait, first, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? Oh right, in the context of atoms in a magnetic field, the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field. So the magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, since the orbital magnetic quantum number m is given as small, maybe that's the m we're referring to here. Or maybe it's the spin m? Hmm, no, wait. The orbital magnetic quantum number is l, and m can be from -l to l. But when m is small, like m=0 or 1, perhaps.

The paramagnetic term, H, is the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. So H = -μ·B. Since the field is along Oz, it's H = -μ_z B. Substituting μ_z, that would be H = -g μ_B m B, but wait, m here is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum? Or is it spin? Hmm, I'm a bit confused there. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = μ·B, which for orbital magnetic moment is H = μ_B m B. Wait, but paramagnetic coupling usually refers to spin, but sometimes can involve orbital as well. Hmm. Wait, the question says paramagnetic coupling term, which I think refers to the spin-orbit coupling, but maybe not. Paramagnetism in atoms is due to the spin of electrons, so perhaps the term here is considering the Zeeman effect for spin.

Wait, but the problem says 'paramagnetic coupling term', which
