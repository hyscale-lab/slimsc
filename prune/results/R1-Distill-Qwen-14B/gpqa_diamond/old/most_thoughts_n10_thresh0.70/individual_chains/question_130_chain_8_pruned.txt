Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting quasars with neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light is stretched as it travels through the expanding universe. The higher the redshift, the farther away the object is, right?

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, I think the Lyman alpha emission line is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. No, wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Right.

But wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen clouds. So the hydrogen is in the quasar's vicinity, or maybe intervening? No, wait, the clouds are in deep space, so they're probably intervening between us and the quasar. So the quasar's light passes through these clouds, and the hydrogen absorbs at their own rest wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength of that absorption line depends on the redshift of the cloud.

But wait, the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of these objects (the clouds) such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telesc
