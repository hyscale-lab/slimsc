Okay, so I have this genetics question here about gene interactions in plants and their resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm, I remember that when genes interact, their combined effects can tell us a lot about their function and relationships.

The question gives me three genes: G1, G2, G3. Each has knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants. The resistance levels are provided for each mutant and the double mutants. I need to figure out the interactions based on these results.

Let me list out the data:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Wait, so when I look at the double mutants, some are as bad as g2. Interesting.

I recall that in genetics, when a double mutant doesn't show a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it suggests that the two genes might be in the same pathway. Alternatively, if a double mutant's phenotype is more severe, perhaps the genes are in parallel pathways.

Also, the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So maybe one of the genes is a TF that activates others.

Looking at the individual mutants:

g2 is the most susceptible (0%), so G2 might be a critical gene. Maybe it's the transcription factor, because if it's knocked out, the resistance is completely gone. So when G2 isn't working, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.

G1 has 75% resistance, which is less than wild-type but not as bad as g2. G3 is at 50%, which is more severe than G1. So when G3 is knocked out, the plant is more susceptible than G1 knockout.

Now the double mutants:

g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. So, in both cases, the double mutant is as susceptible as g2. That suggests that the presence of g2 in the double mutant is the determining factor; perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, or maybe G2 is the only one with a function.

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, then maybe it activates both G1 and G3. If that's the case, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed (if they are downstream targets). But wait, what about the single mutants? g1 has 75% which is not 0%, so maybe G1 isn't required for G2's function. Hmm, maybe G2 activates another gene besides G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the only gene that matters. Or maybe G2 works with G3 but not G1.

Looking at the g1g3 double mutant: their resistance is
