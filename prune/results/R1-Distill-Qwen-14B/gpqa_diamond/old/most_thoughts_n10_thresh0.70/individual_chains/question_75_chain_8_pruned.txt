Okay, so I need to figure out why the transgenic mouse model isn't overexpressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Let's go through the problem step by step.

The setup is that the researcher introduced a GADD45G coding sequence into a plasmid with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. They looked at the plus strand sequence of the construct and noticed something wrong.

Looking at the options, the issue could be a few things. Let's consider each option.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, the HA tag might have a mutation. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If there's a missense, the protein might still be expressed but not recognized by antibodies for affinity purification. But the problem says they couldn't overexpress the protein, which suggests it's not made in sufficient quantities. So maybe this isn't the main issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. How could that happen? Maybe a premature stop codon. Let's look at the sequence. The given DNA is the coding (plus) strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to that. Let me scan for stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Looking through the sequence, I'm looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the mRNA. Wait, the DNA sequence is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the same as the DNA, except T for U. So I need to look for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the mRNA.

Looking through the sequence, I'll go through parts. Let's see:

The given sequence starts with ATG, so that's start. Let's scan for stop codons:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA. Let me go through the sequence:

The first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AA... Wait a minute, there's a TGA right after the start.

Wait, the sequence: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, looking for TGA in the mRNA. So in the DNA, the stop codon would be TAG, if the mRNA is TGA. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: DNA is double-stranded. The coding (sense) strand is same as mRNA. So if the DNA
