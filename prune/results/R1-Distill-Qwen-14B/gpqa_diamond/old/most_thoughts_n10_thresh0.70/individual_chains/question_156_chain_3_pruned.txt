Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The problem says a chemist does two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both standard (achiral) and chiral. The question is about what the chromatograms will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's used in epoxidation reactions, specifically for epoxidizing alkenes. So, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions matter. Oh right, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide, and the stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, so Reaction 1 starts with (E)-oct-4-ene. The E geometry would have the substituents on opposite sides. When you epoxidize that, the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the reaction. mCPBA typically does an electrocyclic opening or maybe a concerted process. Oh wait, I think mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition. So for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the resulting epoxides will have different configurations.

Wait, the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh, right, acid work-up. So, what happens when epoxides are treated with acid? They undergo ring-opening. The acid usually protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with nucleophilic attack. Water is the nucleophile in this case, I think.

So for each epoxide, when treated with acid, what products form? Let me think about the epoxide structure.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. Wait, more accurately, oct-4-ene
