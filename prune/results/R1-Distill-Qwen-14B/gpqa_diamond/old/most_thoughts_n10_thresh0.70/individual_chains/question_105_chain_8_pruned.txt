Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about starspots and exoplanets. Hmm, I need to figure out what the radius of an exoplanet would be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere, with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered, right? So if it's 20%, that's 0.2 of the hemisphere area.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Wait, so spots are at 5000K? Or maybe it's 1000K difference, but the star's Teff is 6000, so spots are 5000K. Not sure, but I'll note that.

The question is about photometric variations due to rotation. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing dips in brightness. We're told that this can mimic an exoplanet transit. So they want to find the exoplanet radius (R_pl) such that its transit would cause the same brightness dip as the spots.

Wait, but the problem says, "if the star was not covered by spots!" So the brightness variation from the planet's transit would be the same as the observed variation from the spots. So we can model both situations and set their brightness changes equal.

First, let's model the brightness variation caused by the spots. When spots are on the visible hemisphere, they block some light. But since they're cooler, their contribution to the star's total light is lower. So the overall brightness change is the difference between the star's brightness with spots visible and without.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Normally, spots cause a dip because when they're facing us, their lower brightness makes the total star appear dimmer. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

Alternatively, the flux from the star when spots are visible compared to when they're not. So, the change in flux is the (normal flux) minus (flux with spots). To find the fractional change, I need to compare the total flux from the star in both scenarios
