Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A to D, each being a different power law.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs). So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, parallax is smaller.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So like, how many stars are there in a given range of parallax values. Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their distances are spread out in a certain way.

I think about the concept of volume in space. The number of stars in a volume depends on how that volume changes with distance. Because the universe expands as you go further out, the volume increases, but how does that translate to the number of stars in a given parallax range?

Wait, parallax plx is 1/d, where d is distance. So if I consider a small change in parallax, d(plx), that corresponds to a change in distance. Let me think about the relationship between a change in parallax and the corresponding volume.

If I have two distances, d1 and d2, with parallaxes plx1 and plx2, the volumes between those distances would be the volume of a sphere with radius d2 minus the volume with radius d1. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the volume between d1 and d2 is (4/3)π(d2³ - d1³).

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with parallax. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume would be proportional to the volume. So the number of stars in a certain distance interval (and thus a certain parallax interval) depends on the volume per unit distance.

Wait, but the parallax isn't a distance directly; it's the reciprocal. So I should probably express the volume in terms of parallax.

Let me define plx as p. So p = 1/d
