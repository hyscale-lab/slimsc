Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a complex with more SCN- ions attached. So β1 is probably the complex with one SCN-, β2 with two, and so on.

Wait, but the order of β might matter. Let's see the β values: β1=9; β2=40; β3=63; β4=16. Wait, β4 is lower than β3. That's interesting. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps the complexes don't form in a certain way. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)n^2−n+? Like, CoSCN^+ (n=1), Co(SCN)2 (n=2), etc.

Wait, the problem mentions "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- groups. So which complex has two SCN- ions? That would be the β2 complex, perhaps. So the question is asking for the percentage of Co(SCN)₂²+ among all the cobalt species.

But wait, the options are percentages, and the answer depends on the distribution of the complexes. I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be calculated using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions involved.

The formula for the fraction of a particular complex in the solution is based on the formation of each complex step by step. Each complex is built by adding SCN- ions to the previous one.

So the general approach is to consider the stepwise formation of each complex and calculate the fraction for each. The fractions will sum up to 10
