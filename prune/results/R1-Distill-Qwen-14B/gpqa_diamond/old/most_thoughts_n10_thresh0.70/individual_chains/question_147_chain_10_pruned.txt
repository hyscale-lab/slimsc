Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me see what it's about. The question is about an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide and produce two particles each of type A⁺ and A⁻. So the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. 

The given data says that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV/c². Wait, I think I remember that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, right? So both p and p̄ have m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV each.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe it's moving at a speed much less than c, so we can approximate it using non-relativistic mechanics? Or perhaps we need to consider relativistic effects because the products might be moving at higher speeds.

Hmm, the question asks for the velocity of particle A. Since the reaction produces two A⁺ and two A⁻, perhaps each A particle is a pion or some other meson, but the mass given is 300 MeV, which suggests it's a heavier particle than a pion. Pions are about 140 MeV/c² each. So maybe it's a kaon or something else.

But wait, the reaction equation: p and p̄ annihilating into two A+ and two A-. So the charges must balance. Proton has charge +e, antiproton has -e. So combining, the total charge is zero. On the product side, 2A⁺ and 2A⁻: that's +2e and -2e, so total charge zero. So charge is conserved.

But I'm not sure about that, maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed.

The key here is to apply conservation laws. Since it's an annihilation process, it's likely that energy and momentum are conserved.

Given that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity. Or maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So probably, the initial setup is that the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So perhaps we can approximate its energy as just its rest energy plus a small kinetic energy. Alternatively, if the problem
