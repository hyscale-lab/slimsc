Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a compound has chiral centers, which are atoms with four different substituents. But wait, there's moreâ€”some compounds might have other forms of asymmetry, like allenes or certain ring structures, but I think for this question, focusing on chiral centers is probably the main thing.

Alright, let's go through each compound one by one. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. The options given are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. It's a double bond at position 1, so the structure is CH2=C(Cl)(CH2CH3). Wait, no, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, and 2-methyl would be a methyl group on the second carbon.

Wait, the structure would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-something? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1. Wait, but it's 2-methyl, so on C2, which is the double bond, you have a methyl group. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that can't be right because the double bond starts at C1. So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. But in the double bond, C1 and C2 are each bonded to two CH2 groups. Hmm. Wait, but in this case, the
