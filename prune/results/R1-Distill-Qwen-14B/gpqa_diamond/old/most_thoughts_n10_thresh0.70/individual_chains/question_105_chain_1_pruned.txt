Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and exoplanets causing brightness variations. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Oh wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered, right? So 20% of the star's surface is spots. But wait, no, wait—the star's one hemisphere is spotty. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. Because the star itself is a sphere, so a hemisphere is half the surface. So the spots cover 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R². Or wait, maybe the filling factor is already 20% of the entire star's surface? Because if it's one hemisphere, the total spot coverage is 20% of that. Hmm, the problem states "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor for that hemisphere is 20%. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The star rotates, causing the spots to come into and out of view, which makes the star's brightness vary. This is similar to when a planet transits a star, causing a dip in brightness. The question is asking, what planet radius would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do?

So the goal is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip caused by the planet is equal in amplitude to the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would the planet's radius need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So the spot-induced variation is the reference, and the planet's effect is compared to that.

I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (the amplitude) caused by the spots. Then, set that equal to the fractional change from the planet transit and solve for Rpl.

First, let's think about the star's total flux when spots are present. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. The amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area and the temperature difference.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. So the total flux from the star would be the sum of the flux from the spotted area and the unspotted area.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots that are on the near side (the hemisphere facing us) will contribute less flux. So when the star rotates, as the spots come into view, the observed flux decreases. The variation in flux will be periodic as the spots rotate in and out of view.

So the
