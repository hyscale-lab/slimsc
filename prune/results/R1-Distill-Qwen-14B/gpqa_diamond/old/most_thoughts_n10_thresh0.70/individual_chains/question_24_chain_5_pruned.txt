Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem talks about a mixture X, which is equimolar and consists of two liquids. This mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but has two other liquids. Importantly, Y does not decolorize bromine water. 

Next, both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions to give a single substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. 

Additionally, it says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds in mixture X.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

First, the fact that X decolorizes bromine water suggests that it has unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes. Because bromine water reacts with alkenes via addition, causing it to decolorize.

But then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y doesn't have double or triple bonds? Or maybe Y's unsaturated bonds are in a form that doesn't react with bromine.

Wait, but if X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and Y is also equimolar, and the reaction is a disproportionation, that means that one component is being oxidized and another is being reduced. Or maybe one of the components is undergoing a disproportionation itself, breaking into two different products. Hmm.

Wait, the reaction is a disproportionation, so the same species is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps the mixture X contains a compound that can undergo this. For example, something like an alkene or alkyne that can form different products upon addition of H2 with catalyst.

Wait, but the catalyst is platinum, and heating is involved. So, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation? Or hydrogenation?

Wait, no, the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y. So it's a reaction with H2? Because Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Oh, wait, but the mixture X is treated with Pt when heatedâ€”does that mean it's being hydrogenated? Because if X contains double bonds, adding H2 with Pt would hydrogenate them. But then, the product Y wouldn't have double bonds, so Y wouldn't decolorize bromine, which aligns with the statement.

Wait, but the problem says that Y does not decolorize bromine, implying no double bonds. So X has double bonds (dec colorizes Br2), Y doesn't (no Br2 decolorization). So the reaction is hydrogenation of X's components. But then why is
