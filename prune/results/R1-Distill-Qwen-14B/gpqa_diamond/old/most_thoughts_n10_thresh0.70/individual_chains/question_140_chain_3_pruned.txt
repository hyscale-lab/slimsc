Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Hmm. So, let's break this down. First, I think I need to figure out what X and Y are. The reaction is violent, which makes me think of something reactive, like maybe a base reacting with an acid, but more likely something more reactive, like a metal reacting with a liquid.

Wait, the product gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule must be something like H2O or CH4, but wait, the same number for both. Let's think: if a molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, perhaps it's something like O2? No, O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons if it's O-16. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Wait, but each oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so two atoms would make 16 each. So the total would be 16 protons and 16 neutrons, same number. So W could be O2? Or maybe CO2? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, the total number of protons would be the sum of the protons of each atom in the molecule. Same for neutrons. So for example, if W is H2O: H has 1 proton, O has 8. So total protons: 2(1) +8=10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8 (assuming O-16). So neutrons total 8. 10 â‰ 8. So no.

Another example: CO2. C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 2*8 =22 protons. Each C is C-12, so 6 neutrons. Each O is O-16: 8 neutrons each. So total neutrons:6 + 2*8 =22. Oh! So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons, same number. So W could be CO2. But wait, CO2 is a gas, and when substances react, maybe releasing CO2?

But wait, the reaction is between X and Y, which is a liquid.
