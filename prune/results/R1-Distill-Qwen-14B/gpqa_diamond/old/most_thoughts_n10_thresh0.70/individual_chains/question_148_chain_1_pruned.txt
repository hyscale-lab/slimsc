Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F. Binary means each compound has Y and F only.

Substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the reaction is probably something like A1 → A2 + F2. The oF for A2 is 31.96%, which I think means the percentage of fluorine by mass. So for A2, the fluorine content is about 32% by mass.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is an oxidizing agent, it's probably a strong oxidizing agent. That makes me think that A1 is a fluoride where Y is in a high oxidation state. Wait, no, fluorine is usually the oxidizing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent because it can cause xenon to oxidize. Xenon in its standard state is Xe^0, but it can form compounds like XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6. So if A1 is causing Xe to oxidize, perhaps A1 is a strong oxidizing agent itself. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizer, but maybe A1 is a compound like F2O or something else? Wait, no, O isn't mentioned here. Wait, Y is the element.

Wait, what's the context? Y forms binary compounds with F. So Y could be something like Cl, but I'm not sure yet. Let's see.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y plus F2 gives A3. So A3 is probably YF_x, a binary compound. So for example, if Y is Cl, A3 would be ClF3 or something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Moving on, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. I need to find the molecular weight of A4.

Hmm. Let's list out what we know.

First, A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the reaction is 2A1 → 2A2 + F2? Or some stoichiometry like that. Let's think about possible fluorides that decompose upon heating.

Wait, maybe A1 is something like NaF·nH2O? No, probably not. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a complex fluoride. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a polymeric structure that breaks down into smaller units upon heating.

But the key point is that A1 decomposes into A2 and F2 gas. So when A1 is heated, it releases fluorine gas and leaves behind A2.

The oF (fluorine content) of A2 is 31.96%. Let me compute the formula mass of A2. Let's say A2 is YF_x. The percentage of F
