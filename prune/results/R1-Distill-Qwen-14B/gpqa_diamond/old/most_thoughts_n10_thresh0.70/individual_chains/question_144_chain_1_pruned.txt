Okay, so I've got this question about meson resonance decay and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think I need is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but wait, the lifetime is related to the width Γ via Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

So the general idea is that the width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ. The relationship is Γ = ħ/τ, which means τ = ħ/(Γ). Then, the mean decay distance L would be velocity (v) multiplied by lifetime τ, so L = v * τ = v * ħ/(Γ).

Wait, but velocity v can be expressed in terms of the energy and mass. For relativistic particles, the energy E is much larger than the mass, so E ≈ pc, where p is the momentum. Then, since v = (p c²)/(E), because p = γ m v, and E = γ m c². So putting it together, v ≈ c * (p)/(E) = c * (sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/E) ) = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). But since E is much larger than m, this simplifies to v ≈ c. But maybe I shouldn't approximate so quickly.

Alternatively, I can calculate beta (β) as β = v/c = (pc)/E. Since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so (pc)² = E² - (m c²)^2. So β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c²)) / c²? Wait, not sure. Let's think again.

Wait, β = v/c, and since E = γ m c², and p = γ m v. Then, p = (γ m v) = (γ m c) β. So p c = γ m c² β. And since E = γ m c², then β = (p c)/E. So yes, β = (p c)/E.

But p can be found from E and m. Since E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2, so p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) → so β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^2)) )? Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to compute β as sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)). Because (pc)^2 = E^2 - m² c^4. So:

β = (pc) / E = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) /
