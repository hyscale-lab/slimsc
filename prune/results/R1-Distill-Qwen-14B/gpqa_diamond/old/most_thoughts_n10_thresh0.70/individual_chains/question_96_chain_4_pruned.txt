Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D with various exponents.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon, k is Boltzmann's constant, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant.

So first, I need to find the area A. To get A, I probably need the radius of the event horizon, which is the Schwarzschild radius R_s. The Schwarzschild radius is given by R_s = (2 G M) / c^2. But wait, I don't have the mass M yet. Oh, maybe I can find M using the angular size.

Angular size θ (in radians) is related to the actual size (like the diameter) and the distance. The formula is θ ≈ diameter / distance. Wait, no, more accurately, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance when the size is much smaller than the distance. So, θ ≈ R_s / d, but I need to be precise.

Wait, the diameter of the event horizon is 2 R_s, so the angular size θ (in radians) would be θ = (2 R_s) / d. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me think. The event horizon radius is R_s, so the diameter is 2 R_s. So the angular size is (2 R_s) / d, but θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first.

So, first step: convert θ from degrees to radians. Since 1 degree is π/180 radians, θ = 1e-17 degrees is (1e-17) * (π / 180) radians. Let me calculate that: π
