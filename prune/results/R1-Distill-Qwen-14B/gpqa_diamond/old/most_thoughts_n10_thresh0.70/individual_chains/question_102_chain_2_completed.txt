Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down and figure out what's going on.

So the question is about a ligand-receptor pair that's expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments, and the outcome is that there's no green signal under the microscope. I need to figure out why that is.

First, let me understand the components. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. So the receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) maybe? Or another type of membrane receptor. The ligand and receptor are being expressed using a bicistronic vector, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct.

The vector is bicistronic and uses lox-Cre technology. So it's probably using loxP sites for recombination. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe used for overexpression. The receptor has an IRES element upstream, which allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated from a separate ribosome binding site, meaning the two proteins can be expressed as separate entities.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette in loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's another stop cassette in lox2272. I remember that loxP and lox2272 are recognition sites for the Cre recombinase, but they are different in sequence. So when Cre is present, it can excise the stop cassettes.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So when Cre is expressed, it will recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassettes. That would allow both the ligand and the receptor to be expressed. Without Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP.

So the setup is for the Cre to excise the stop signals, allowing the expression of both proteins. So in cells expressing Cre, you should see both mCherry (from the ligand) and eGFP (from the receptor). But in the case of the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under the control of SOX10, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells.

The mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So their offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre. The mice are visualized under a confocal microscope, but no green signal is observed. Green would come from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor.

Hmm. So why isn't eGFP expressed? Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression? If they're paracrine, perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on nearby cells. But in this setup, the construct is in the same cells, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed in the same cells. I don't see how paracrine would cause no eGFP expression. Maybe if ligand is secreted, but the question is about the expression of the GFP, not the function.

Option B: receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. Receptors are often trafficked to the cell surface. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be on the surface, so antibodies might not detect it. But in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The Western showed signals proportional to actin, so presumably the proteins were expressed and detected. But wait, the question is about the mouse model's fluorescence. Did they check expression via Western? Let me go back. The initial setup says they tested the construct expression on Western blot, using the antibodies. So if the proteins were expressed, the Western would show the bands. But the question is about the mouse model, which presumably has the construct in the genome, and they're using SOX10-Cre to activate it.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre construct. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor would not be expressed, because the stops are in place. When Cre is present, it would excise the stops, allowing both ORFs to be expressed.

But the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, but they're crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, the construct would have Cre activated, leading to the expression of ligand and receptor.

But in the confocal, no green signal. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Let me think about the expression. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, so it should be expressed when the stop cassette is removed. The receptor is under the IRES element, which is after the stop cassette. So the IRES allows for the translation of the receptor regardless of the upstream stop, perhaps?

Wait, the vector is set up so that the ligand ORF is first, then the stop cassette, followed by mCherry. The receptor is after the IRES, with its own stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, the vector is:

Ligand ORF + stop (loxP) + mCherry ORF

IRES + Receptor ORF + stop (lox2272) + eGFP ORF

So without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP. But when Cre is present, it removes the cassettes. So in the presence of Cre, both mCherry (ligand) and eGFP (receptor) should be expressed.

But in the mice, they're using SOX10-Cre, so in neural crest-derived cells, Cre is active. So the construct should be excised, allowing ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the visualization, no green signal. So either the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed, or it's not present on the surface, or the antibody isn't working.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection to primary astrocytes. So when they transfected the construct into astrocytes, which presumably don't express Cre, the stops would remain, so only when they introduce Cre (like in the experiment) would the proteins be expressed. But in the mouse model, the construct is in the genome, and they're using SOX10-Cre to activate it. So in neural crest cells, the Cre would activate the construct.

But why no eGFP? The options suggest possible issues.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed, the receptor ORF might be read through into the stop, but in the presence of Cre, the stop should be excised. Alternatively, if the eGFP is not in frame, meaning the reading frame is disrupted. So when the stop is excised, if the coding sequence of the receptor is followed by eGFP in the same ORF, but if the reading frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be expressed.

Wait, the vector is set up as ligand ORF followed by a stop (loxP), then mCherry. Then IRES, then receptor ORF followed by a stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the loxP stop is excised. So the ligand ORF is followed by mCherry. But mCherry is downstream of the ligand, but without a stop, would that cause a problem? Or perhaps the ligand is in frame with mCherry? Wait, the ligand's ORF is followed by the stop, so when the stop is removed, the ligand is followed by mCherry. So the ligand's ORF would be in frame with mCherry's ORF? That would create a fusion protein, but that's probably not intended.

Wait, but the construct is a bicistronic vector. So perhaps each ORF is separated by a stop cassette. So the first ORF is ligand, then the stop, then mCherry. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of the vector as having two separate expression units. The first is ligand under CBA, followed by a stop cassette, then mCherry. The second is IRES-driven receptor ORF, followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, no. The usual bicistronic vectors have two cassettes, each with their own promoter or internal ribosome entry. But in this case, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter because it's within the same transcript but uses internal initiation. So without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. With Cre, the stops are removed, so the ligand is expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the construct should be active, leading to expression of ligand and receptor, along with their respective fluorescent proteins.

Assuming the expression is correct, why no eGFP? Maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed. Looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame. So when the stop cassette is removed, the receptor ORF is followed by eGFP, but if the frames don't align, the eGFP wouldn't be translated. So the construct would produce the receptor, but without the eGFP.

Wait, maybe the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so the stop is not in the same frame as the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF is read into the eGFP's ORF, but if the frames are off, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a separate protein. So the GFP might not be made, leading to no signal.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is in the same frame, but in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frame shift and no proper GFP.

But the question is about the expression. So if the stop is correctly removed, but the eGFP is not in frame, the GFP won't be made. So in the Western blot, would the receptor be expressed? Because the receptor is under the IRES. Wait, IRES allows the receptor's ORF to be translated without the need for a promoter. So even if the stop is in the same transcript, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in the correct frame with respect to the receptor. So the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, but not in frame, so it's not expressed. So without the correct reading frame, the eGFP wouldn't be translated.

So in this case, the Receptor-eGFP would not be a fusion, but the eGFP is just not being expressed. So in the Western, the receptor would be detected, but eGFP wouldn't. But in the mouse model, they're looking for eGFP fluorescence. So the eGFP isn't present, so no green.

Another possibility is option B: the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. But if the eGFP is a C-terminal tag, and the receptor is properly trafficked, the eGFP should be on the cell surface. But if the receptor is retained in the ER or Golgi, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed on the surface, so it wouldn't fluoresce. However, in this case, the construct would still produce eGFP, just not on the surface. So the Western blot would show the receptor and eGFP as a single band, but the fluorescence would be weak or absent. But the question says no green signal, which could be due to this.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector wasn't properly excised, so the stop remains. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should excise the stop. Unless SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells. But SOX10 is involved in neural crest, which is where the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, another possibility: the enhancer for expression is missing. Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. So perhaps without an enhancer, the expression isn't happening. But CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe that's not the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the vector doesn't have the necessary regulatory elements. For example, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, but perhaps the construct lacks an enhancer or other elements required for proper expression in the mouse. But I think the question focuses more on the vector's design leading to failed expression.

So, putting it together, the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop wasn't properly excised, or because the reading frame is wrong.

Wait, but the lox2272 stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is excised, allowing eGFP to be expressed. So if the stop isn't excised, eGFP isn't made. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate it.

Wait, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells, or the construct isn't properly recombined. But the question says they breed the mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wt background, then cross with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is active in neural crest cells, which should excise the stops.

But wait, the vector is bicistronic lox-Cre. So the construct is inserted into the genome in a way that the lox sites are present. The presence of Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stop cassettes. So both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed in the same cells as the ligand and receptor.

But if the lox sites are not properly recognized, the stops would remain. But in the setup, the stops are loxP and lox2272, which are different. So Cre can only excise loxP and lox2272 if it's the same as another lox site? Or wait, Cre acts on loxP sites in a specific way. If the construct has loxP sites, and the Cre is compatible, then the stops would be excised.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has multiple lox sites, and the Cre is not recognizing them properly. But that's more about the construct design.

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So after the stop is excised, the receptor's ORF is followed by eGFP, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be translated correctly. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal.

Another thought: lox2272 is a variant of loxP, and recombinant Cre can recognize it, but perhaps in this case, the construct has a lox2272 site upstream of eGFP. When Cre is present, it would excise the lox2272-stop cassette, allowing eGFP to be expressed in frame.

Wait, but if the stop cassette has a different lox site than the one upstream, maybe the stops aren't excised correctly. Or perhaps the eGFP is in a different reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the IRES affects the downstream expression.

Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. The IRES allows for the translation of the receptor independently of the ligand's promoter. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF is expressed, and the eGFP should be at its C-terminus. So eGFP should be expressed as part of the receptor.

But if the stop is correctly removed, the eGFP should be expressed. So why is there no green signal?

Another angle: maybe the vector is set up such that the eGFP is not expressed because the reading frame is off. So the receptor's ORF is in one frame, and the eGFP in another, making the eGFP not in the same frame, thus not being translated.

So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be produced because the frames don't match.

So looking at the options, option D suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, then the eGFP won't be expressed, leading to no green signal.

Alternatively, the vector design might have a mistake in the reading frame.

So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor ORF and eGFP, there is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. SOX10-Cre is used to excise these stop cassettes, enabling expression of the ligand, receptor, mCherry, and eGFP. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed in the offspring when visualized under a confocal microscope.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand acts on nearby cells, but the question focuses on the expression of eGFP fused to the receptor in the same cells. Paracrine signaling does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor were retained in the Golgi, eGFP might not fluoresce on the cell surface. However, the Western blot would still detect the receptor and eGFP if they were expressed. This explanation does not account for the complete absence of eGFP expression.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under an IRES element, which does not require a promoter. While enhancers can influence expression, the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to be the primary reason for the lack of eGFP expression.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The vector design includes a stop cassette upstream of eGFP. If the stop cassette is not excised or if the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, eGFP would not be translated. This would result in no green signal, as observed. This explanation aligns with the vector design and the experimental outcome.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of a green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, preventing the expression of eGFP. This would occur if the stop cassette upstream of eGFP was not properly excised or if the frames of the receptor and eGFP ORFs do not align.
