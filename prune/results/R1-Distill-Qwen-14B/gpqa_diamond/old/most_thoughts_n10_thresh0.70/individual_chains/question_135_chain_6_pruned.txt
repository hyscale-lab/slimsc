Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think through it.

The problem states that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, X is a boson field interacting with fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the allowed decay modes of X at the lowest order.

First, I remember that in particle physics, a boson that can decay into fermions must satisfy certain energy and conservation laws. The decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but in pair production, each fermion has a rest mass. So for a pair (like f and f-bar), each has mass m, so total is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to list all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. 

What are the known fermion masses? Let me think. The fermions are quarks, leptons, and maybe others. But in the Standard Model, the known ones are:

Quarks:
- Up (u), Down (d): light, around a few MeV each. So 2m is around 10 MeV, which is way less than 6 GeV.
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV, so 2m ~ 200 MeV. Also way under.
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV. So 2m ~3 GeV. That's exactly the limit. So c c-bar is allowed.
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV. 2m is ~9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b can't be produced.
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So no.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV. So 2m is negligible.
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV. 2m ~0.2 GeV, allowed.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV. 2m ~3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait, wait. Wait, no. 1.78 GeV for tau, so 2*1.78=3.56 GeV. So 3.56 <6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Wait, 1.78*2 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Wait, but wait: let me double-check the tau mass. The tau is about 1.78 GeV. So two taus would sum to ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, tau pair decay is allowed.

What about the others? Neutrinos are massless (or nearly so), so their pairs would be allowed too. But the problem doesn't list neutrinos as options, so maybe we don't consider them.

So for fermions, possible decay pairs are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-bar, e e-bar, mu mu-bar. Wait, but in the options, some of these are present.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s, u u, d d, tau + tau-, e+ e-. But wait, the b mass is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV which is more than 6. So b decay isn't allowed. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: X → c c, s s, u u, d d, tau tau, mu mu, e e. Wait, but the option says it includes c c-bar, s s-bar, etc. So c c-bar is allowed (as 2*1.5=3 GeV≤6), tau is allowed (2*1.78=3.56 GeV ≤6), mu is allowed (each ~0.1 GeV, 2*0.1=0.2 GeV). So B includes c, which is allowed. So B would have c and tau, e, mu, s, u, d.

Wait, but wait, the option says "c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-". So all of these, except maybe the bottom, which isn't included. So in this case, the allowed fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. 

Wait, but the interaction term is written as L = ... (v + X) psi_f. So X interacts with fermion fields psi_f. So which fermions couple to X? The coupling is proportional to the fermion field, so any fermion can in theory couple. But the mass of X is 6 GeV, so only fermions with 2m ≤6 GeV can be decay products.

So the possible fermions are: up, down, strange, charm, tau, electron, muon. Because their rest masses are less than 3 GeV. Wait, wait: the tau is 1.78 GeV, so two taus sum to 3.56 GeV. So that's allowed.

So the possible decay channels for X would be into any of these fermion-antifermion pairs. So X→ c c-bar, s s-bar
