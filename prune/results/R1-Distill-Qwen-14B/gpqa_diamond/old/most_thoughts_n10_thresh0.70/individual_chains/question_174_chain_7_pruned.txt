Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about an atomic nucleus undergoing spontaneous fission. So, I remember that fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy. In this case, it splits into two fragments. The initial nucleus has a rest mass M, and its rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Hmm, that's a huge amount of energy, way more than what we normally deal with in everyday situations.

The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Let me denote the masses. Let's say the lighter fragment has mass m, so the heavier one has mass 2m. Together, their combined rest mass is 99% of the initial mass M. Wait, but the initial nucleus's rest mass is M. So, the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M.

So, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M / 3. Let me calculate that. 0.99 divided by 3 is 0.33, so m ≈ 0.33 M. So the two fragments have masses approximately 0.33 M and 0.66 M each.

Wait, but the initial mass was M. So the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M, which is less than M. That means some mass has been converted into energy, probably the kinetic energy of the fragments and possibly other forms like binding energy, but the question mentions only two fragments, so perhaps we can ignore other energies beyond their rest masses and kinetic.

So the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let me think about conservation of momentum here.

In the non-relativistic case, each fragment will have some kinetic energy, and their momenta should cancel each other. So, for non-relativistic, we can use the classical equations.

But the question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation of T1, where T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

So, I need to compute T1 relativistically and then compute it classically, then find the difference.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the velocities of the two fragments using conservation of momentum (relativistic case).
2. Compute their kinetic energies.
3. Find the difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical T1.

Wait, but how do I handle the relativistic case? I think I'll need to set up equations using the conservation of both energy and momentum.

So, the initial energy is just the rest mass energy of M, which is 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies.

But wait, the rest mass energies sum to 0.99 M * c². Wait, the initial nucleus had a rest mass of M, so M * c² = 300 GeV. Therefore, each fragment's rest mass energy
