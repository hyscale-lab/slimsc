Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, I remember that FTIR is good for functional groups, and NMR helps with structure details.

First, the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and stronger. A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester, but combined with the O-H from a carboxylic acid, that makes me think the compound is a carboxylic acid. So the molecule probably has a -COOH group.

Now looking at the NMR data. There are no vinyl hydrogens (like from double bonds) because the NMR doesn't show any peaks for those. So the structure doesn't have any double bonds. That eliminates any possibility of that, but all the options seem to be branched without double bonds.

The NMR has some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that sounds complicated. Let me think. Splitting in NMR comes from neighboring protons. So a doublet of triplets would come from coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe each neighboring group has a different number of protons.

Looking at the options, I need to consider the structures. Let's list them out:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, so each of these has a carboxylic acid group, as I thought. Let me see their structures.

Option D: It's CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central part is a four-membered chain? Wait, no, it's like a central carbon attached to another carbon. Maybe it's (CH2CH3) groups attached? Wait, let me draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structures are similar to 2,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or something. Wait, maybe it's a substituted pentanoic acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like 3,3-dimethylpentanoic acid or another substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the NMR splitting. Let's think about the possible structures and the neighboring hydrogens.

In a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually broad, but in the NMR, it's often not observed because it's exchanged and broad. So maybe the COOH proton isn't showing up as a sharp peak. So the NMR signals we're seeing are for the other protons.

The signals might be from the CH groups adjacent to the ester or the substituents.

Looking at the options, let's think about the possible H environments.

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the two central carbons each have a CH group attached to two CH3 groups. So each CH has two adjacent CH3 groups. Maybe the protons on those CH groups would be split by neighboring H's.

Wait, the central CHs would each be attached to two CH3 groups. So each CH would have H's that are next to a CH3 and another CH. Let me consider.

In option D, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, the formula is CH3CH2C(H
