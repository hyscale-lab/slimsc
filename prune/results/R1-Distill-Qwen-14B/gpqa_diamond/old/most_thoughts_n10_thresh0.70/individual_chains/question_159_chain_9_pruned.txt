Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let me think through this.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in near infrared and optical spectrum. Then, the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths less than 790 nm. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, this might relate to redshift. Because when objects are moving away, their light shifts to longer wavelengths. So if the peak is at 790 nm, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha emission line or something else. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. If we see it at 790 nm, that would mean a redshift z such that 121*(1+z) = 790. Let me calculate that.

So, 121*(1 + z) = 790. Divide both sides by 121: 1 + z = 790/121 ≈ 6.528. So z ≈ 5.528. Wait, that's a high redshift. So the quasar is quite far away.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance from Earth to the quasar in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM parameters. The given parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m = 0.3, dark energy Ω_λ = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k =0).

Comoving distance D_c is the distance we calculate based on the expansion of the universe. For a given redshift z, D_c is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(t)) dt, where E(t) is the expansion factor's function.

Wait, E(z) is sqrt(Ω_r (1+z)^4 + Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_λ (1+z)^0 + Ω_k (1+z)^(-2)) ). But since Ω_r (radiation) is negligible now, and Ω_k is zero because the universe is flat, E(z) simplifies to sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_λ
