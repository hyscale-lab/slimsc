Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation, I think. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. So there's this alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they're sending a spacecraft at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip would take from their point of view. The options are whether he dies, or specific years like 72,77,81.

Wait, the question is about the astronaut's own perspective. So from their frame of reference, how much time passes. Right, because when you travel at such high speeds, time dilation occurs—so the astronaut's clock runs slower compared to an outside observer.

But wait, no. Wait, no, actually, from the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted. So the distance isn't the same as what we observe from Earth. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Hmm, okay, let's think about the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh, right, so maybe I should look up how far away the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Earth. Let me recall—I think it's about 160,000 light-years away. So that's the distance from Earth's frame.

But in the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted by the Lorent
