Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question deals with the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields, which are described by the potentials V and A.

The problem says that there's a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). At some earlier time tr, the charge's velocity is v. The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So, d is like the displacement vector between the two points at time tr.

The question asks for the expressions of the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr. So, t is the later time when we're measuring the fields, and tr is when the charge was at a position that generated the fields we're observing.

I think I remember that the scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward, something like V = q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because you have to consider retarded times and such. Oh wait, right, the retarded time is the time when the field was actually generated, considering the finite speed of light. But in this case, the problem seems to already give us that tr is the earlier time, so maybe I don't need to calculate that part.

Wait, but the problem gives the vector d as the vector from the field generation point to r. So, maybe d is the distance between where the charge was at tr and the observation point. So, the distance would be |d|, perhaps. But I'm not sure how that factors into the potentials.

I also recall that the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge. The general expression for A when a charge is moving is something like (μ0 q v )/(4π) times some function. But I'm not exactly sure about the denominator.

Let me think about the retarded potential approach. The scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential but evaluated at the retarded time. Wait, but in this question, they're already considering the fields generated at tr, so perhaps that's factored into the expressions given.

Wait, but the options have different forms. Let's
