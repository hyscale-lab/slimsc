Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I need to calculate [PO4^3-] in the solution.

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, but I'm not sure if that matters right now. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Wait, the problem is about phosphate ions. So I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The K values tell us about the acidity of each deprotonation step.

So the salts given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociation in water. KH2PO4 is a diprotic acid, right? It can donate two protons. When it dissociates, I think it becomes H2PO4^- and K+.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Na+ is a spectator ion. So Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. Since these are conjugate acid-base pairs, they can form a buffer solution. But wait, the problem is about PO4^3- concentration. Hmm, so how does that happen?

Wait a second, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The salts provided are KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which gives HPO4^2-). So when these two are mixed, they can react with each other? Or maybe they form a buffer?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me jot down the dissociations:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-
Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2-

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. These two can interconvert via the second dissociation of H3PO4. The reaction is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

The K for this reaction would be Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-. Oh, that's the third deprotonation. So how do we get PO4^3-? HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-, with Ka3 being 1.8e-12. That's a very small K, meaning that PO4^3- isn't going to be very concentrated.

But in this solution, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, maybe they can influence each other. But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the concentrations first.

So first, let's calculate the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005614 mol.

So the solution has 0.007336 mol H2PO4^- and 0.005614 mol HPO4^2-.

Wait, but since the solution is 200 cm³ (0.2 L), the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M.

But now, these two are in solution. So the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3- concentration. Hmm. How does that come into play?

Wait, perhaps because the solution is at a certain pH, and some of the HPO4^2- may dissociate into PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is buffered such that the pH is determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4, which is around 7.2 (since Ka2 is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 ≈ 7.21).

At pH 7.2, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would be roughly equal because pH is near pKa2. But in this case, the moles aren't equal. Hmm.

Wait, but the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, using the H-H equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the numbers:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M
[H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M

So log(0.02807 / 0.03668) = log(0.765) ≈ -0.113

pH ≈ 7.21 + (-0.113) = 7.097.

So pH is about 7.1.

Now, what's the pH of the solution? Approximately 7.1.

Now, at this pH, can HPO4^2- deprotonate further to form PO4^3-? Let's see. The third dissociation has pKa3 ≈ log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

Since the solution's pH is 7.1, which is lower than pKa3 (11.74), the solution is acidic enough that HPO4^2- won't lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this differently. Maybe the concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using the Ka3 expression.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So the expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 and [HPO4^2-], but we need [H+]. Since the pH is about 7.1, [H+] = 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 7.94e-8.

Let me calculate that.

First, multiply 1.8e-12 by 0.02807:

1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.0526e-14.

Then divide by 7.94e-8:

5.0526e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ 6.36e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. I used [HPO4^2-] as 0.02807 M, but in reality, some of the HPO4^2- might have reacted with H+ from the buffer to form H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. So maybe the actual [HPO4^2-] is less than 0.02807 because some of it has reacted?

No, wait. No, because in the buffer solution, the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is determined by the pH. So the initial concentrations are 0.02807 and 0.03668 M, but the actual concentrations after considering the buffer would be in a ratio based on pH.

Wait, maybe not. Because in the buffer, the concentrations are in the ratio determined by the pH. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation tells us that:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

So [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2)

We calculated [HPO4^2-] as 0.02807 and [H2PO4^-] as 0.03668. Let me verify if this ratio holds.

pH is 7.097, pKa2 is 7.21. So pH - pKa2 = -0.113 → 10^-0.113 ≈ 0.775.

So [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.775.

Which is close to 0.02807/0.03668 ≈ 0.765. Close enough considering the approximations.

So, the actual concentrations are as calculated. So [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

So back to calculating [PO4^3-].

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in assuming that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M. Because in the solution, some of the HPO4^2- may have reacted with H+ to form H2PO4^-, but the buffer equation adjusts for that. So perhaps the actual [HPO4^2-] is lower than the initial 0.02807 M because some has converted to H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. The buffer equation accounts for that. The moles are fixed, but the concentrations are in a ratio determined by pH. So the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M, but that's under the assumption that all the initial moles are present. But wait, the initial moles are fixed because the salts are fully dissociated. So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is determined by the buffer equation, but the concentrations are adjusted based on the solution volume.

Wait, maybe the total concentration of phosphate species (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-) is the sum of all their concentrations. But in this case, we have only H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution because the salts fully dissociate. So the initial moles are:

H2PO4^-: 0.007336 mol

HPO4^2-: 0.005614 mol

So the total phosphate species is 0.01295 mol.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me proceed.

So, using the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

Rearranged:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

So plugging the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M

[H+] = 10^-7.097 ≈ 7.94e-8 M

So:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 7.94e-8 = ?

Let me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.02807: 1.8 * 0.02807 ≈ 0.050526 → 5.0526e-14.

Then, 5.0526e-14 / 7.94e-8 → 5.0526 / 7.94 is approximately 0.636 → 6.36e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, let me be precise with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [H+] more accurately.

pH = 7.097 → [H+] = 10^-7.097.

Calculating 10^-7.097: 10^-7 is 1e-7. 0.097 is about 0.1. 10^0.1 is approx 1.2589. So 10^(-0.097) = 1/(10^0.097) ≈ 1/1.25 → approx 0.8.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.8 ≈ 8e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 7.94e-8. Let me compute it accurately.

pH = 7.097 → [H+] = 10^-7.097.

Compute 10^7.097 = 10^7 * 10^0.097.

10^0.097. Let's see, log(1.25) is about 0.09691. So 10^0.097 ≈ 1.25.

So 10^7.097 ≈ 1.25e7 → [H+] = 1 / (1.25e7) ) = 8e-8 M.

So [H+] ≈ 8e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 8e-8.

Let me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = ?

1.8 * 0.02807 = 0.050526 → 5.0526e-14.

Divide by 8e-8 → 5.0526e-14 /8e-8 = (5.0526/8) * 1e-6 → 0.631575 * 1e-6 → 6.31575e-7 M.

So approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. So perhaps this is the right answer.

Wait, but did I make any mistakes? Let me check.

Alternative approach: Maybe the HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with PO4^3-. So the amount of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02807 M, but in solution, some of it dissociates to form PO4^3-.

So the expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+]

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the activity coefficients are considered, but I think the problem expects us to ignore that and use concentrations directly.

Another point: Did I account for the total phosphate species correctly? Let me think.

Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution. The other phosphate species (H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) are present in much larger concentrations, but their presence affects the pH, which in turn affects the [PO4^3-].

So in this case, the [PO4^3-] is determined by the third dissociation, considering the pH of the buffer solution.

So the calculation seems correct. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps the [HPO4^2-] is not 0.02807 M because some of it has converted to H2PO4^- due to the buffer. But no, as per the buffer equation, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is fixed, and the concentrations are adjusted accordingly. So the [HPO4^2-] is indeed 0.02807 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the initial moles again. The initial moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007336 mol, and HPO4^2- is 0.005614 mol. The total phosphate in solution is 0.01295 mol.

But when considering the buffer, let me compute the actual concentrations.

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b.

From the buffer equation:

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a)

We found that pH ≈7.097, pKa2=7.21, so log(b/a)= -0.113 → b/a=0.775 → b=0.775a.

Also, the sum a + b ≈ 0.01295 mol (since the solution volume is 0.2 L, the concentrations are a/0.2 and b/0.2).

Wait, no. Because the total moles of phosphate is 0.007336 (H2PO4^-) + 0.005614 (HPO4^2-) )= 0.01295 mol.

Wait, but when the buffer works, some of the H2PO4^- may have converted to HPO4^2- and vice versa. But wait, no, in the buffer, the two are in equilibrium, so the total concentration is a + b = initial concentration.

Wait, no, the initial concentrations are fixed because the salts fully dissociate. So [H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M before any reaction. But in reality, the buffer equation tells us that the ratio of these concentrations is determined by pH.

So if the buffer equation says that the ratio is 0.775, then:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.775 [H2PO4^-]

But the sum of [HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-] = (0.775a) + a = 1.775a = (0.03668 + 0.02807) = 0.06475 M.

Wait, no. Because the concentrations are in M, so:

[H2PO4^-] = a = 0.03668 M

[HPO4^2-] = b = 0.02807 M

But according to buffer equation, b = a * 10^(pH-pKa2) = a * 0.775.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.775 * [H2PO4^-]

But [H2PO4^-] is about 0.03668 M, so b=0.775 * 0.03668 ≈ 0.02815 M. Which is close to the initial 0.02807 M. So perhaps the assumption that the initial concentrations are correct is acceptable, considering rounding errors.

So perhaps my initial calculation is correct, and [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

But the options don't have 6.3e-7; option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

Wait, let me re-calculate the [H+] more precisely.

pH =7.097 → [H+] = 10^-7.097.

Using a calculator: 10^7.097 = 10^7 * 10^0.097.

Compute 10^0.097.

We know that log(1.25) ≈ 0.09691. So 0.097 is a bit more than log(1.25).

Let me compute 10^0.097 more accurately.

Using the Taylor expansion or linear approximation.

Let me use natural logarithm: ln(10^x) = x ln(10).

So 10^0.097 = e^{0.097 * ln(10)}.

ln(10) is approx 2.302585.

0.097 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.22435.

e^0.22435 ≈ 1 + 0.22435 + (0.22435^2)/2 + (0.22435^3)/6.

0.22435^2 ≈ 0.05034 → 0.05034/2=0.02517.

0.22435^3 ≈ 0.0113 → 0.0113/6≈0.00188.

So e^0.22435 ≈ 1 + 0.22435 + 0.02517 + 0.00188 ≈ 1.2514.

So 10^0.097 ≈ 1.2514.

So 10^7.097 = 1.2514e7 → [H+] = 1/(1.2514e7) ≈ 7.99e-8 M.

Which is about 8.0e-8 M.

Wait, earlier I thought [H+] was 7.94e-8, but more accurately, it's about 7.99e-8.

So [H+] =7.99e-8.

Now, re-calculate [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 7.99e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8 * 0.02807 = 0.050526 → 5.0526e-14.

Denominator:7.99e-8.

5.0526e-14 /7.99e-8 = (5.0526 /7.99 ) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /7.99 ≈0.632.

So 0.632e-6 → 6.32e-7 M.

Which is approx 6.32e-7.

But looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M.

Hmm. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise calculation of [H+] or using more accurate pKa values.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the [HPO4^2-] is not exactly 0.02807 M because some of it is converted to PO4^3-.

Wait, but the amount of PO4^3- is very small, so the change in [HPO4^2-] would be negligible, so it's safe to ignore it.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M. But the closest option is A:6.24e-7. Maybe I made a calculation error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles of HPO4^2- are actually 0.005614, but considering the buffer equation, perhaps the actual [HPO4^2-] is less, which would decrease the [PO4^3-].

Wait, no. Because the buffer equation determines the ratio, but the total moles are fixed. So the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

Wait another approach: perhaps we can calculate the pH more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the exact expression for [PO4^3-].

Let me compute it more precisely.

[H+] = 10^(-7.097) = 8.91e-8 (using calculator? Let me think. Maybe 8.91e-8 is more precise.)

Wait, perhaps using exact calculation for 10^-7.097.

Let me find 10^-7.097:

Take the natural logarithm: ln(10^-7.097) = -7.097 * ln(10) ≈ -7.097 * 2.302585 ≈ -16.354.

So exp(-16.354) ≈ 8.91e-8.

So [H+] =8.91e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 8.91e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.91e-8.

5.0526e-14 /8.91e-8 = (5.0526/8.91) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.91 ≈0.5668.

So 0.5668e-6 →5.668e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 5.67e-7 M.

But that's not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact pH value.

Wait, when I computed the pH using the buffer equation, I had:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2=7.21.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02807, [H2PO4^-]=0.03668.

Ratio = 0.02807/0.03668 ≈0.765.

Log(0.765) ≈-0.113.

So pH=7.21-0.113=7.097.

So [H+] =10^-7.097 ≈8.91e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) /8.91e-8.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02807 =1.8 * 0.02807 =0.050526 →5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.91e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 /8.91e-8 = (5.0526 /8.91 ) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.91 → let me compute that.

8.91 ×0.566 = 5.05 (since 8.91 ×0.5=4.455, 8.91 ×0.06=0.5346 → total 4.455+0.5346=4.9896. So 0.566 gives 4.9896. But 5.0526 is a bit bigger. So 8.91 ×0.5668 ≈ 5.0526.

So 5.0526/8.91 ≈0.5668.

So 0.5668e-6 →5.668e-7 M.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The closest is option B:5.48e-7 M.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Alternative approach: perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the two salts may react with each other.

Wait, when you mix a solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they can form a buffer. So the pH is determined by the H-H equation.

But perhaps another reaction occurs: H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- → 2 H2O + 2 PO4^3- + 2 H+.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would depend on the pH, but in reality, they are in equilibrium determined by Ka2.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact [H+] using the buffer equation.

But I think I did that correctly earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not a 1:1 mixture, so the [H+] is different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact [H+] using the buffer equation, without approximating.

The buffer equation is:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M, [H2PO4^-] =0.03668 M.

So log(0.02807/0.03668) = log(0.765) → using calculator:

log(0.765) ≈-0.113.

So pH=7.21-0.113=7.097.

So [H+]=10^-7.097 ≈8.91e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) /8.91e-8.

Wait, 1.8e-12 *0.02807 =5.0526e-14.

5.0526e-14 /8.91e-8 = approx 5.668e-7 M.

But this doesn't match any of the options exactly. The closest is B:5.48e-7, which is about 5.5e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.8e-12 *0.02807 more accurately.

1.8 * 0.02807 = ?

0.02807 *1.8:

0.02 *1.8=0.036.

0.00807 *1.8=0.014526.

Total: 0.036 +0.014526=0.050526.

So 5.0526e-14.

Divide by 8.91e-8: 5.0526e-14 /8.91e-8=5.0526/(8.91) *1e-6.

5.0526/8.91 → let's compute this exactly.

8.91 *0.566 =5.05.

5.0526 -5.05 =0.0026.

0.0026/8.91 ≈0.000292.

So total is 0.566 +0.000292=0.566292.

So 0.566292e-6 →5.66292e-7 M.

Approximately 5.66e-7, which is about 5.66 ×1e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:5.48e-7 and option D:3.97e-7.

Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I need to re-examine the approach.

Wait, perhaps the solution's pH is such that HPO4^2- is the dominant species, but the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.

HPO4^2- can undergo two reactions: it can donate a proton to become PO4^3- (with Ka3), or accept a proton to become H2PO4^- (depending on the solution's pH).

But in our buffer, the pH is around 7.1, which is below pKa3 (11.74), so the third deprotonation is not favored. So the concentration of PO4^3- is very low.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 expression.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

Rearranged:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Which is what I did.

But perhaps, the [HPO4^2-] is not exactly 0.02807 M because some of it has been converted into PO4^3-.

Wait, but if [PO4^3-] is x M, then [HPO4^2-] would be 0.02807 - x. But since x is very small (on the order of 1e-7 M), 0.02807 - x ≈0.02807. So neglecting x is acceptable.

So the initial calculation holds.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately, considering the exact values.

Let me re-calculate with precise numbers.

Compute [H+] =10^-7.097.

Using a calculator, 10^-7.097 is approximately 8.03e-8 M.

So [H+] =8.03e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) /8.03e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02807=5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.03e-8.

5.0526e-14 /8.03e-8 = (5.0526/8.03) *1e-6.

5.0526 /8.03 ≈0.629.

So 0.629e-6 →6.29e-7 M.

Ah, this brings it to approximately 6.29e-7 M, which is very close to option A:6.24e-7.

So perhaps with more accurate [H+], the [PO4^3-] is about 6.29e-7 M, which rounds to 6.29e-7, and the closest option is A:6.24e-7.

But why the discrepancy? Maybe I should compute [H+] more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the exact calculation without approximating [H+].

Wait, perhaps I should compute pH precisely.

We have:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2=7.21.

[HPO4^2-]=0.02807 M.

[H2PO4^-]=0.03668 M.

Ratio=0.02807/0.03668=0.765.

log(0.765)= log(765e-3)= log(765) -3 + log(1e-3)= no, wait. Wait, log(ab)=log a + log b.

Wait, 0.765 =7.65e-1.

So log(7.65e-1)= log(7.65) + log(1e-1)= 0.884 -1= -0.116.

So pH=7.21 -0.116=7.094.

So [H+]=10^-7.094.

Compute 10^-7.094:

7.094 =7 +0.094.

10^7.094=10^7 *10^0.094.

10^0.094.

We know that log(1.24)≈0.0936. So 10^0.094≈1.24.

So 10^7.094=1.24e7 → [H+]=1/(1.24e7)=8.06e-8 M.

So [H+]=8.06e-8.

Now, compute [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02807) /8.06e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02807=5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.06e-8.

5.0526e-14 /8.06e-8 =5.0526 /8.06 *1e-6.

5.0526 /8.06≈0.627.

So 0.627e-6 →6.27e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.27e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but why is this not matching exactly with any of the options? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the initial moles.

Let me compute the moles more accurately.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 g/mol is exact?

Well, 136.09 g/mol → 136.09 /1.00 =136.09.

So 1.00g /136.09 g/mol → 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99g/mol →0.005614 mol.

But perhaps more precise calculation is needed.

Compute moles of KH2PO4:

1.00 /136.09 = 0.007336 mol (exactly).

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:1.00 /177.99 = 0.005614 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So [H2PO4^-]=0.007336 /0.2=0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-]=0.005614 /0.2=0.02807 M.

So, the ratio is 0.02807/0.03668 =0.765.

pH=7.21 + log(0.765)=7.21 -0.113=7.097.

[H+]=10^-7.097= 8.03e-8 M.

[PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 *0.02807) /8.03e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02807=5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.03e-8.

5.0526e-14 /8.03e-8 =5.0526/8.03 *1e-6.

5.0526 /8.03 ≈0.629.

0.629e-6=6.29e-7.

Which is approximately 6.29e-7 M.

The closest option is A:6.24e-7.

Hmm, perhaps the slight difference is due to rounding during calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the solution is a buffer and use the buffer equation, but perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait another approach: calculate the pH using the exact concentrations.

But I think that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- without considering the buffer, but that would be incorrect because the buffer affects the pH, which in turn affects [PO4^3-].

So I think the correct approach is as I did, leading to approximately 6.29e-7 M, which rounds to 6.3e-7, but the closest option is A:6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the exact [H+].

Using pH=7.097 → [H+]=10^-7.097.

Let me use natural logarithm for better precision.

ln(10^-7.097) = -7.097 * ln(10) ≈-7.097 *2.302585≈-16.354.

So [H+] = e^(-16.354) ≈e^-16.354.

We can compute e^-16.354:

e^-16 ≈ 1.12535e-7.

e^-0.354 → e^-0.354 ≈ 1/(e^0.354) → e^0.354≈1.425 → 1/1.425≈0.702.

So e^-16.354≈1.12535e-7 *0.702 ≈7.90e-8 M.

So [H+]=7.90e-8.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02807) /7.90e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02807 =5.0526e-14.

Denominator:7.90e-8.

5.0526e-14 /7.90e-8 =5.0526/7.90 * 1e-6.

5.0526 /7.90 ≈0.6395.

So 0.6395e-6 →6.395e-7 M.

Which is 6.4e-7 M.

Still, the closest option is A:6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer.

Another possibility: perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the amounts of the two salts are not in the ratio dictated by the pKa.

Wait, the buffer equation is pH = pKa + log (base/acid).

In our case, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] =10^{pH-pKa}.

But since the problem gives fixed amounts of both salts, the solution will have a pH determined by this ratio.

But if the ratio deviates significantly from 1, the pH will shift accordingly.

In our case, the ratio is 0.765, which is less than 1, so pH is less than pKa2, which is 7.21, so pH is around 7.097.

So the calculation is correct.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of all phosphate species in the +3 oxidation state, which would include HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

But no, the question specifically says orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-.

So the calculation should be as I did.

Wait, maybe the error is in the use of [HPO4^2-] as 0.02807 M.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the actual [HPO4^2-] considering the buffer.

Wait, the buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We can rearrange this to find [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^{pH - pKa2}.

We have [H2PO4^-] =0.03668 M, [HPO4^2-] =0.02807 M.

But according to the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-] should be [H2PO4^-] * 10^{(7.097 -7.21)} =0.03668 *10^{-0.113} ≈0.03668 *0.775≈0.02829 M.

Which is very close to the initial 0.02807 M.

So the initial assumption holds. So the value of [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

So, the calculation of [PO4^3-] as approximately 6.29e-7 M.

Given the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7 M.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the equilibrium involving the third dissociation of phosphoric acid ($\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$). The solution contains 1.00 g of $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$ (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in a total volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation constants for $\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$ are provided: $K_a1 = 7.5 \times 10^{-3}$, $K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$, and $K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}$.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$
- Moles of $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes $0.007336 \, \text{mol}$ of $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$.

- Moles of $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes $0.005614 \, \text{mol}$ of $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$
The total volume of the solution is 0.2 L, so:  
- \[
  [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007336 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.03668 \, \text{M}
  \]
- \[
  [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005614 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02807 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the buffer
The solution is a buffer consisting of $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} \right)
\]
- \(\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21\)
- \(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} = \frac{0.02807}{0.03668} \approx 0.765\)
- \(\log(0.765) \approx -0.113\)

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 - 0.113 = 7.097
\]

### Step 4: Calculate $[\text{H}^+]$
From the pH:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.097} \approx 8.03 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Use the third dissociation to find $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$
The third dissociation of $\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$ is:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{PO}_4^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]
The equilibrium constant is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO}_4^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{8.03 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
- Numerator:  
  \[
  (1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807) \approx 5.0526 \times 10^{-14}
  \]
- Denominator:  
  \[
  8.03 \times 10^{-8}
  \]
- Final calculation:  
  \[
  [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.03 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ is approximately $6.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$. The closest option is **A: $6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$**.

Answer: A
