Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine undergoes electrophilic substitution on aromatic rings, typically adding a bromine atom. But wait, the question is about the para isomer's yield and how their weight fractions compare. I need to arrange substances 1 to 6 based on increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Wait, the problem says each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each will produce a single product, but whether it's ortho, meta, or para depends on the substituents on the benzene ring.

So the activating or deactivating groups on the benzene will direct the incoming bromine. Activating groups (like -OH, -NH2, alkyl groups) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COO-) are meta directors.

Wait, but wait, the substituents can affect the directing effect. So for each substituent, I need to determine if it's activating or deactivating and whether it's an ortho/para or meta director.

Let me list each substance:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's phenyl acetate. The substituent is OAc (acyloxy). Wait, I think the acyloxy group is a meta director. Because esters are deactivating (since they're electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl) and meta directing.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's chlorobenzene. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group, making it deactivating. But wait, chlorine is ortho/para directing because it's an activating group? No, wait, no. Wait, Chlorine is slightly deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para directing because the lone pairs can donate through resonance. So it's deactivating but ortho/para.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. NO2 is a strong deactivating group and meta directing.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para director.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. COOH is a strong deactivating group. It's a meta director because it's a strong electron-withdrawing group.

So for each substituent, the directing effect is:

1) CH3: o/p director, activating → para is major.

2) COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta director → para is minor.

3) Cl: deactivating (but o/p), so para is a major product.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, Cl is ortho/para director because it's a deactivating but ortho/para directing group. So in chlorobenzene, when bromine adds, the product will be more para than ortho. Because Cl is a deactivating group, but as an o/p director, the major product is para, with some ortho.

4) NO2: meta director. So the para isomer is not formed; the major product is meta. So the para isomer's yield is very low.

5) C2H5: o/p director, activating → major para product.

6) COOH: meta director → so para is not major. The para isomer's yield is low.

Wait, but wait, for each substituent, the question is about when bromine (Br2) is used. Electrophilic substitution with Br+ as the electrophile. So in each case, the substituent directs where the bromine will go.

Now, the problem is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. Wait, but the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each reaction gives a
