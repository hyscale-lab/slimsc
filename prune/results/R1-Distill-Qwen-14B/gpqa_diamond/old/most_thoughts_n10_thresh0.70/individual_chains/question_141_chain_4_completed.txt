Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is. It says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. And they're asking how many possible organic products there are from this reaction. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's a benzene ring with a bromine atom on the first carbon and a deuterium on the second carbon. So the structure would be bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. I think.

Now, the reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and is commonly used for deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic systems. In such conditions, especially when dealing with aromatic rings, elimination or substitution reactions can happen.

Wait, another thought. When benzene rings have substituents, especially when deprotonated, they can undergo various reactions. But in this case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the ring has bromine and deuterium. 

Oh wait, wait. Wait a second. 1-bromobenzene-2-d would be o-bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. Or is it para? No, 1 and 2 are adjacent positions on benzene, so that's the ortho position.

So, the structure is benzene ring with Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2. So, two substituents adjacent to each other. Now, when this is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, perhaps it will deprotonate the ring. But where can the H be abstracted?

Wait, but wait. The benzene ring is deprotonated to form a benzene anion. But in this case, the ring already has Br and D. So, which positions are available for deprotonation?

Wait, but the ring might have sites where the H can be abstracted. Let me think about the structure again. The Br is at position 1, D at position 2. So the ring looks like:

1: Br
2: D
3: H (assuming)
4: H
5: H
6: H

Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, each carbon is connected in a ring. So if the ring is numbered with Br at 1 and D at 2, then positions 3,4,5,6 are the other carbons. So, the H's on positions 3,4,5,6 are available for deprotonation, except if they're meta or para to substituents.

But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so it might abstract a proton from the ring. The ring is deactivated by the Br, which is an electron-withdrawing group, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution but more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution perhaps.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction isn't substitution. The solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a good solvent for elimination and deprotonation reactions. So, perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, benzene with Br at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. So there's a Br and a D on adjacent carbons. Wait, wait a second. If the Br is at 1 and D at 2, then the H that would be abstracted would be from position 3 or maybe position 4?

Wait, perhaps the Br is at position 1, D at position 2. So the positions adjacent to Br are 2 and 6. But position 2 has D. So the H in position 3 is para to position 6 (wait, no, position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Hmm, maybe I should draw this out.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the Br is at one position, and the D is in the ortho position. So, when the base abstracts a proton, which position does it take? Let me think.

In aromatic rings, the deprotonation tends to occur in positions where the resulting anion is most stable. Electron-withdrawing groups (like Br) deactivate the ring and direct incoming substituents to certain positions. But in this case, the ring is already substituted with Br and D.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of elimination, where the Br leaves, but wait, Br is a leaving group, but under what conditions? Typically, elimination reactions (like E2) require a base. But if the Br leaves, perhaps as Br^-, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring undergoing a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but it's a benzene ring, which is already aromatic. So maybe the bromide is leaving, and a hydrogen is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond? Wait, but benzene is already an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a Friedel-Crafts reaction, but NaNH2 isn't a Lewis acid. Wait, maybe it's a Birch reduction? No, Birch reduction uses metal like Na or Li in ammonia and typically leads to dihydro derivatives. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. NaNH2 in ammonia is also used for deprotonating arenes to form anions, which can then undergo various reactions. For example, deprotonation of toluene gives a benzene anion which can attack an electrophile.

But in this case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which is a benzene ring with Br and D in the adjacent positions. So, the molecule might have a hydrogen somewhere else that can be abstracted by the base, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge.

Wait, but the deprotonation would occur at a position where the resulting anion is most stabilized. The presence of the Br (an EWG) would direct deprotonation to the para position, perhaps. But wait, considering the substituents, the ring already has Br at 1 and D at 2. So the possible deprotonation positions are 3,4,5,6.

Wait, let me think of the ring as a hexagon. Positions 1 is Br, 2 is D, and the others are H. So the positions available are 3,4,5,6.

Deprotonation would occur at positions ortho, meta, or para to the substituents. But with Br being an EWG, it would activate certain positions for deprotonation. Wait, EWGs like Br deactivating the ring, making it less reactive towards electrophiles, but for deprotonation (nucleophilic attack?), perhaps they direct deprotonation to certain positions.

Wait, when the ring is deprotonated, the negative charge would be most stable in positions that are conjugated with the EWG. For example, in phenols, the deprotonation occurs at the acidic alpha H, leading to a phenoxide ion where the negative charge is on the oxygen. But in this case, it's a benzene ring with Br and D.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about benzene with Br and D. When the base deprotonates the ring, which positions are possible?

Wait, so the structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, let's imagine the ring: position 1 (Br), position 2 (D), position 3 (H), position 4 (H), position 5 (H), position 6 (H). 

When the base (NaNH2) abstracts a hydrogen, which positions can it take? The available hydrogens are at positions 3,4,5,6.

Wait, but the presence of Br (EWG) would make the ring more electron-deficient. So, the base might abstract a hydrogen that is in a position where the resulting anion is most stabilized. That would likely be positions that are adjacent to the EWG (ortho) or para to it.

Wait, but Br is at position 1. So the para position to Br would be position 4. So, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4. Alternatively, maybe from position 3 or 5, which are meta to Br.

Wait, but in benzene, the deprotonation is more likely to occur in positions that are ortho or para to the EWG because those positions are more electron-deficient, making it easier to lose a proton.

Wait, but in this case, position 2 has D, which is adjacent to Br. So, position 2 is already substituted. So, the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (which has D), or position 4, which is para to Br.

Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to D (position 2) and position 4 is para to Br (position 1). So, which is more favorable for deprotonation?

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 or position 6, which are ortho to Br. Wait, position 6 is adjacent to Br (position 1), so position 6 is ortho to Br. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 6, making the anion at position 6, which is ortho to Br.

Wait, but position 6 already has H. So, deprotonating position 6 would result in a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6, which is ortho to Br.

Alternatively, deprotonation at position 3 would result in a negative charge at position 3, which is meta to Br and also adjacent to position 2 (D).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

Wait, when benzene rings are deprotonated, they can form benzene anions, which can then react in various ways. But in this case, the solvent is ammonia. So, perhaps the deprotonated ring can undergo elimination with the Br.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, perhaps leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system with all double bonds. So, how can elimination happen?

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene anion, which might then undergo a substitution with the ammonia.

Wait, but in that case, the ammonia would act as a nucleophile. So, the benzene anion (with a negative charge) might attack an electrophilic ammonia molecule, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the deprotonated ring could attack something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br leaves, and the incoming nucleophile is ammonia or something else.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, and in condensed ammonia, perhaps it's deprotonating the ring, leading to a benzene anion. Then, perhaps the Br leaves as Br^- since the ring is negatively charged, making a good leaving group.

Wait, so if the ring is deprotonated, the negative charge is on the ring, then the Br could leave, forming a benzene anion with a negative charge, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by something else.

Wait, maybe this is a case of a benzyne intermediate. I remember that when a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate two halides to form a benzyne intermediate, which can then react with nucleophiles.

But in this case, the starting material is only mono-bromobenzene. Oh wait, but perhaps the deuterium is part of another substituent. Wait, no. The starting material is 1-bromo, 2-d. So, only Br and D on the ring.

Hmm, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, and the Br leaves as Br^-, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge and a new substituent from the ammonia.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group or something else. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then captures a proton from somewhere else, but that doesn't seem to explain the product count.

Wait, maybe the deprotonation occurs at more than one position, leading to different regioisomers. For example, if the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 3 or position 6, leading to different structures.

Wait, but let me think about the molecule. The Br is at position 1, D at 2. So, the possible positions for deprotonation are 3,4,5,6.

But wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D), perhaps the resulting anion would be at position 3. Alternatively, if it abstracts from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br), the anion would be at position 6.

Wait, but in either case, the ring would have a negative charge in a position that's activated by the substituents. So, perhaps the reaction is leading to different possible products based on where the deprotonation occurs.

Wait, but how would that affect the product? If the ring is deprotonated, then Br could leave, perhaps leading to a ring expansion or something else. Alternatively, maybe the ring can't lose a substituent unless there's another leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a triple bond or something. But benzene doesn't have triple bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen, generating a carbanion, which then leads to elimination of the Br, forming a benzynelike structure but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution where the Br is replaced by a deuterium or something else. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction. Wait, but I'm not recalling the exact mechanism.

Another angle: when benzene rings have two substituents, the positions where new substituents add depend on the directing effects of the existing groups. For example, if a substituent is meta-directing, new groups add in the meta position relative to it.

But in this scenario, after deprotonation and substitution, the new substituent (if any) would be directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation doesn't lead to substitution but instead to a di-substituted benzene with different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is leading to a ring expansion or contraction, but I can't think of a mechanism that would do that here.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia is used in the Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Or in other dehydrohalogenation reactions, like in alkanes, leading to alkenes.

But in aromatic systems, perhaps it's used for dehalogenation. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of demetallation, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, since the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But in aromatic rings, SN2 is not feasible because the ring structure doesn't allow for the necessary backside attack.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible products. The question is how many possible organic products are formed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with different substituents. So, for each possible deprotonation site, a different product forms.

Wait, but how many possible deprotonation sites are there? Let's think about the structure again.

The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, the available positions for deprotonation are 3,4,5,6.

But the directing effects of Br and D (if any) would influence where the base abstracts the proton.

Wait, but D is a deuterium, which is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. In some cases, it can affect reaction rates, but in this context, perhaps it's just a substituent that doesn't significantly affect the reactivity.

Wait, Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which would direct meta substitution in electrophilic substitution reactions. However, in deprotonation, which is more of a nucleophilic process, the directing effects might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a position that's para to the Br, which is position 4. Or maybe ortho to the Br, which is position 6.

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br), so that's ortho to Br. So, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to a carbanion at position 6, which is ortho to Br.

Alternatively, the base could abstract a proton from position 3 (meta to Br, adjacent to D), or position 4 (para to Br), or position 5 (meta to Br).

But how would that affect the product? Let's imagine that the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzene anion. Then, perhaps the Br^- leaves, and the ring picks up a substituent from the ammonia solvent.

Wait, so if the ring becomes negatively charged, the Br could leave as Br^-, and then an ammonia molecule could attack, leading to substitution.

So, the reaction could be:

Br is at position 1, and after deprotonation at position 6, the ring has a negative charge at 6. Then, Br leaves, and NH2^- could attack, perhaps leading to NH2 substitution at position 1.

Wait, but in that scenario, the product would be 1-amino benzene (aniline), but that doesn't account for the D at position 2.

Wait, but the D is at position 2, so in the product, the D would remain. So, the product would be 2-d, 1-amino benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs at a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation at position 3 would lead to substitution at position 3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the number of possible products depends on how many different positions the substitution can occur.

Wait, if the base can abstract a proton from several positions, each leading to a different product, then each deprotonation site would lead to a different substitution product.

So, let me think. The possible deprotonation positions are 3,4,5,6.

But wait, perhaps some positions are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, let's imagine the molecule: Br at 1, D at 2. So, the molecule isn't symmetric; it's chiral? Or maybe not, since D is a substituent but not a chiral center.

Wait, but in any case, the positions available for deprotonation are 3,4,5,6.

But if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, it's adjacent to D at 2, and another from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1.

But perhaps after deprotonation and substitution, the product's substituents would be in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, but how many unique products can form?

Let me think. Each possible deprotonation site could lead to a different substitution position.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, substitution occurs at position 3. From position 4, substitution at position 4. From position 5, substitution at 5. From position 6, substitution at 6.

But wait, the ring is symmetric in some way. Let me think about the molecule's symmetry.

The molecule has Br at 1 and D at 2. So, the only symmetry line would be the one passing through the Br and the D, making positions 3 and 6 mirror images, and positions 4 and 5 mirror images.

So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, the resulting product after substitution would be 3-substituted. Similarly, abstracting from position 6 would lead to 6-substituted, which is equivalent to position 3 due to symmetry.

Wait, no. Wait, position 3 and 6 are in different positions relative to Br and D. Because Br is at 1, and D at 2. Position 3 is next to D (position 2), and position 6 is next to Br (position 1). So, the substitution products at 3 and 6 would be different.

Similarly, position 4 is opposite Br (position 1), and position 5 is opposite D (position 2). So, substituting at position 4 would lead to a different product than substituting at position 5.

Wait, maybe not. Because substitution at position 4 is para to Br, while substitution at position 5 is meta to Br. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, each substitution leads to a unique product.

So, if the base can abstract a proton from four different positions, leading to four different substitution products, but due to symmetry, some might be the same.

Wait, but let me count. If the base abstracts from position 3, substitution occurs at 3 (which is adjacent to D at 2). From position 6, substitution occurs at 6 (adjacent to Br at 1). From position 4, substitution occurs at 4 (para to Br). From position 5, substitution occurs at 5 (meta to Br and adjacent to position 4).

Wait, but if the substitution occurs at 3 and 6, would those be different products? Because the substituents are in different positions relative to Br and D.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecule: Br is at 1, D at 2, and substitution at 3 would place the new group between D and position 4. Substitution at 6 would place the new group between Br and position 5.

So, those are two different products. Similarly, substitution at 4 is para to Br, and substitution at 5 is meta to Br.

Wait, but when substitution occurs at 4, the product would have two substituents: Br at 1 and NH2 (from substitution) at 4. But wait, no, Br leaves, so the product would be a benzene ring with D at 2 and NH2 at 4.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The Br leaves, and the new substituent comes in at the position where the base abstracted the proton. Because the base abstracts a proton, forms a carbanion, which then leads to Br^- leaving, and then the ring picks up a new substituent from the ammonia.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is like this: deprotonation at position X forms a carbanion at X, which causes the Br to leave, and then the ring is negatively charged, which can react with ammonia (NH3) to form a new substituent, perhaps an amine.

So, the product would have a new substituent (like NH2) at position X, along with the D at position 2.

But wait, what about the original Br? It leaves, so the product is a benzene ring with D at position 2 and the new substituent at position X.

So, the number of possible products would depend on how many different positions X are possible, leading to different substitution products.

So, if the base can abstract a proton from positions 3,4,5,6, each leading to a different substitution product, then there would be four products. But some of these might be the same due to symmetry.

Wait, but let's look again at the possible positions:

After deprotonation at 3: product is 3-NH2 and D at 2. But wait, no, the product would have D at 2 and NH2 at 3.

After deprotonation at 6: product would have D at 2 and NH2 at 6.

After deprotonation at 4: product would have D at 2 and NH2 at 4.

After deprotonation at 5: product would have D at 2 and NH2 at 5.

So, four different products: 2-d, 3-nh2; 2-d,4-nh2; 2-d,5-nh2; 2-d,6-nh2.

But wait, could any of these be the same due to symmetry?

Looking at the benzene ring, position 3 and 6 are symmetric relative to the Br and D? Or maybe not.

Wait, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-d. The possible substitution positions are 3,4,5,6. Let's number them:

1: Br

2: D

3: H (available for substitution)

4: H (available)

5: H (available)

6: H (available)

So, after substitution, the products would have NH2 at 3,4,5,6, along with D at 2.

Are any of these positions equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry?

The molecule's symmetry would depend on the substituents. The Br at 1 and D at 2 make the molecule not symmetric across any axis except perhaps the one going through positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but the molecule has Br at 1 and D at 2, which are adjacent. So, the axis going through position 1 and position 4 would not be a symmetry axis because position 2 would have D and position 6 would have H (originally). Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks symmetry, so each substitution position leads to a unique product.

Wait, but if the molecule is not symmetric, all four substitution positions (3,4,5,6) would lead to four different products. So, four possible products.

But wait, the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, the options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

But that would mean the answer is A)4. However, perhaps I'm overlooking something.

Wait, another thought: when you have deuterium at 2 and NH2 at 3, is that a different product than NH2 at 6 and D at 2?

Yes, because the substituents are in different positions relative to each other. For example, D at 2 and NH2 at 3 would be adjacent (ortho), whereas D at 2 and NH2 at 6 would be meta to each other (since from 2 to 6 is two carbons away).

Wait, no. From position 2 to 6 is three positions away (2-3-4-5-6 is four, but in a ring, it's the shortest path). Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent (since it's a six-membered ring). Wait, no, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 are arranged in a ring. So, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, position 2 and 6 are across the ring, separated by position 1 and 5.

Wait, no, the arrangement is 1 next to 2 and 6; 2 next to 1 and 3; 3 next to 2 and 4; 4 next to 3 and 5; 5 next to 4 and 6; 6 next to 5 and 1.

So, position 2 and 6 are not adjacent. The distance between 2 and 6 is two positions apart (2-3-4-5-6 is five steps, but the shortest path is 2-1-6, which is two steps: from 2 to 1, then 1 to 6. So, the distance between 2 and 6 is two bonds apart, making them meta to each other.

Wait, no. On a benzene ring, the distance (in terms of positions) is determined by the minimal number of steps. So, between 2 and 6, the minimal path is 2→1→6, which is two steps. So, positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other.

So, if substitution occurs at 3, then NH2 is at 3, which is adjacent (ortho) to D at 2. Substitution at 6, NH2 is at 6, which is ortho to Br (position 1) and meta to D (position 2).

Substitution at 4: NH2 is para to Br (position 1), and meta to D (position 2). Substitution at 5: NH2 is meta to Br and adjacent to D (position 2).

So, all four substitution positions (3,4,5,6) would lead to different products, each with NH2 in a different position relative to D and Br.

But wait, if the Br leaves, then the substituent comes in at where the H was abstracted. So, the products would have D at 2 and NH2 at 3,4,5,6.

So, four different products. So, the answer would be 4, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps some of these products are actually the same due to the molecule's symmetry.

Wait, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-d. If substitution occurs at position 3 and position 6, are those products mirror images of each other? Or would they be different?

Looking at the structure, if substitution is at 3, the product would be 2-d, 3-nh2. If substitution is at 6, the product would be 2-d, 6-nh2.

But since the molecule is not symmetric, these would be two distinct products. Similarly, substitution at 4 and 5 would also give unique products.

So, four products in total.

Wait, but the options don't have four as an option except option A.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A)4

B)1

C)2

D)3

So, if all four substitution positions are possible, the answer would be 4, option A.

But wait, perhaps not all four positions are possible. Maybe some positions are not accessible due to steric hindrance or other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but elimination, leading to a different product.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a demetallation or a coupling, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a benzyne intermediate, but that requires two adjacent leaving groups, which we don't have here.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of any similar reactions I know of.

Wait, I remember that when a benzene ring has two substituents and is treated with a strong base, like NaNH2 in ammonia, it can undergo deprotonation and elimination to form a triple bond, like in the case of 1,2-dibromobenzene forming benzyne.

But in this case, we have only one Br and one D. So, I don't think elimination to form a triple bond is possible.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But for that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic substitution, which typically requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. But Br is EWG, so maybe it's possible.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions generate the amide ion (NH2^-), which could attack the ring in a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be highly activated, which is usually not the case with just Br. Usually, multiple EWGs are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to the ring being activated enough for substitution.

But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr and forming a double bond, but benzene is already a conjugated system.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again about the possible products.

If the reaction leads to substitution at four different positions, leading to four products, then the answer is A)4.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure if all four positions are actually possible. Maybe only two are feasible due to steric or electronic reasons.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed through substitution but through some other mechanism, leading to fewer products.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the deprotonation occurs only at position 4, which is para to Br. Because para positions are often favored for deprotonation when there's an EWG.

In that case, substitution would occur only at position 4, leading to only one product. But that would mean option B)1, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps deprotonation occurs at two positions, leading to two products. For example, ortho and para to Br.

Wait, but in that case, the ortho position is position 2 (which has D, so perhaps not available) and position 6.

Wait, position 2 has D, so the base can't abstract a proton from there. So, position 6 is ortho to Br, and position 4 is para.

So, if the base abstracts from position 6 (ortho to Br) and position 4 (para to Br), that would be two possible products. So, two products, option C)2.

But earlier I thought substitution could occur at four positions. Now I'm getting confused.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about what NaNH2 does in such reactions. I recall that NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes from haloalkanes. But for aromatic rings, it's used for deprotonation leading to aromatic anions.

In the case of toluene, treatment with NaNH2 in ammonia deprotonates the ring, forming a benzene anion which can then react with an electrophile.

But if the aromatic anion is formed, and then Br leaves, perhaps the ring picks up an NH2 group at the site of deprotonation.

So, the position of deprotonation determines where the NH2 group substitutes.

Thus, the number of possible substitution positions would determine the number of products.

If the deprotonation can occur at multiple positions, each leading to a unique product, then the number of products would be equal to the number of unique deprotonation sites.

So, in this case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d. The possible deprotonation positions are 3,4,5,6.

But perhaps due to the substituents (Br and D), some positions are more favorable than others.

Wait, but if the base is strong enough and the ring is sufficiently activated, multiple deprotonation sites may be possible, leading to multiple products.

So, if all four positions are possible, the answer is four. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation occurs only at position 4 (para to Br), leading to a single product. But that seems unlikely because other positions are available.

Wait, perhaps the deprotonation occurs at position 3 and position 6, which are adjacent to D and Br, respectively. So, substitution at 3 and 6 would lead to two products. But then what about positions 4 and 5?

Alternatively, maybe the Br directs deprotonation to the para position (position 4), leading to substitution there. That would be one product.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought. Maybe the reaction conditions are such that only one product is formed, perhaps through a specific mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene anion, which then dimerizes or does something else, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Hmm. Another approach: think about the possible products and their structures.

Product 1: D at 2, NH2 at 3.

Product 2: D at 2, NH2 at 4.

Product 3: D at 2, NH2 at 5.

Product 4: D at 2, NH2 at 6.

So, four products. Therefore, the correct answer would be 4, option A.

But wait, the question says "how many possible organic products are there in this reaction?"

If all four are possible, then the answer is A)4.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form all four products due to steric or electronic reasons. For example, deprotonation at position 3 and 5 (which are meta to Br) may not be favored as much as positions 4 and 6.

But without knowing the exact regiochemistry of this reaction, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms two products: substitution at 3 and 6. Because those are the positions ortho to D and Br, respectively, making them more activated for deprotonation.

Alternatively, perhaps only one product forms, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a single product because the deprotonation occurs at a single position.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the possible regiochemistry. The ring has Br and D. The base abstracts a proton to form a benzene anion. The EWG (Br) would activate certain positions for deprotonation.

In aromatic deprotonation, the base tends to abstract a proton that's at the position most activated by the substituents. For EWGs, deprotonation tends to occur in positions ortho and para to the EWG.

But in this case, the Br is at position 1, so the ortho positions are 2 and 6.

Position 2 has D, so the base can abstract a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br).

The para position to Br is position 4, which is another possible site for deprotonation.

So, deprotonation could occur at position 6 (ortho) and position 4 (para) to Br.

Thus, leading to substitution at these positions, giving two products.

So, the number of products would be two, option C)2.

So, putting that together, the correct answer would be option C)2.

Wait, but what about positions 3 and 5? They're meta to Br. Are they possible sites for deprotonation?

Hmm, perhaps in this case, the para position (4) and the ortho position (6) are the only ones that are deprotonated because they're activated by the Br's EWG effect. The meta positions (3 and 5) may not be as activated, so deprotonation there is less favorable.

So, only positions 4 and 6 are deprotonated, leading to two products.

Therefore, the answer would be option C)2.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base that typically abstracts protons from positions on the aromatic ring where the resulting anion is most stabilized. Bromine, being an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), activates certain positions for deprotonation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d**:  
   - Bromine is at position 1.  
   - Deuterium is at position 2.  
   - The remaining positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are available for deprotonation.

2. **Deprotonation and Substitution**:  
   - Bromine, as an EWG, directs deprotonation to positions ortho and para to itself.  
   - Ortho positions to bromine are 2 and 6. However, position 2 already has deuterium, so deprotonation occurs at position 6.  
   - Para position to bromine is position 4, which is also a favorable site for deprotonation.  
   - Positions 3 and 5 are meta to bromine and less activated for deprotonation, making them less likely to participate in the reaction.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - Deprotonation at position 6 (ortho to bromine) leads to substitution at position 6.  
   - Deprotonation at position 4 (para to bromine) leads to substitution at position 4.  
   - Positions 3 and 5 are not favored due to the weaker activation by the EWG effect of bromine.  

Thus, the reaction produces two distinct products: one with the new substituent at position 4 and another at position 6. These products are structurally unique due to the different relative positions of the substituents.

### Conclusion:
The reaction yields two possible organic products.
