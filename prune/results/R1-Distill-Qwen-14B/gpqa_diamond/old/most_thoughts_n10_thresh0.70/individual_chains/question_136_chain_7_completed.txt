Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of f, which is ∇ · f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, right. I remember that divergence is a measure of a vector field's source or sink at a point. And the volume integral of divergence is essentially the total outward flux through the surface, which according to the divergence theorem should be equal to the flux through the closed surface, like the sphere here.

Wait, but what's the divergence of this particular field? Let me think. The field is purely radial, so in spherical coordinates, the divergence would have only the radial component. The general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the radial component.

In this case, f_r is 1/r². So plugging that into the formula, the divergence would be (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let's compute that step by step.

r² * (1/r²) is equal to 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. That means the divergence ∇ · f is zero. Wait, but wait a second—that can't be right. Because I remember from electromagnetism that the electric field of a point charge has a divergence proportional to the charge density, which is a delta function at the origin. Oh right, Gauss's law. So ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀, and for a point charge, ρ is a delta function.

But in this problem, the vector field given is f(r) = 1/r² radial. Let me see, the electric field of a point charge Q is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * Q/(r²) r_hat. The divergence of that is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the integral of the divergence over any volume that includes the origin would be Q/(ε₀), which is 4π Q when using Gaussian units.

Wait, but in our problem, the field is f(r) = 1/r². So that's like the electric field due to a charge Q where Q/(4πε₀) = 1. So the divergence of this field would be zero everywhere except at r=0. Because the divergence is a delta function there.

So the volume integral of ∇ · f over the sphere of radius R would be the integral of the divergence, which is zero except at the origin. So the integral would pick up the value at the origin, which is the flux through the surface, which for this field would be similar to Gauss's law.

Wait, but let me think again. Because according to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇ · f over the volume is equal to the flux through the surface. So if the field is f(r) = r_hat / r², then the flux through the sphere of radius R is the integral of f · n_hat dA over the surface, where n_hat is the outward normal (which is r_hat for a sphere).

So the flux would be ∫ (r_hat / r²) · r_hat * 4π R² dθ sinθ dθ dφ. Wait, wait, no. The integral over the surface is ∫ f · dA. Since f is radial, dA is r_hat times dA. So f · dA = (1/r²) * r² dA since r_hat · r_hat is 1. So it's (1/r²) * r² dA = dA. The integral over the sphere's surface is then ∫dA = 4π R². So the flux is 4π R².

But wait, the divergence theorem tells us that the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux through the surface. But earlier, I thought the divergence of f is zero except at the origin, so the integral would just be the point at the origin. But that's not the case. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the divergence.

Wait, let me compute ∇ · f correctly. The vector field is f = (1/r²) r_hat. So in spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² f_r). Since f_r is 1/r², then r² f_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = 0 everywhere except at r=0.

Wait, but that can't be right because the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin. So the volume integral of ∇ · f is the integral of zero over the volume except at a point. But in reality, the divergence is not zero; it's a delta function at the origin. So ∇ · f = 4π δ³(r). Because that's the case for the electric field of a point charge.

So the integral of ∇ · f over the volume would be 4π times the volume containing the origin. If the sphere of radius R includes the origin, then the integral is 4π. If R is zero, it's zero, but R is a sphere centered at the origin, so R is positive, so the integral would be 4π.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇ · f over the volume is the flux through the surface, which we calculated as 4π R². But according to the expression I have for the divergence, it's 4π δ³(r), so the integral would be 4π * 1 (since the volume includes the origin, and the delta function integrates to 1).

But that's conflicting because according to the flux calculation, the surface integral is 4π R², but according to the divergence, it's 4π.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me step back.

The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r_hat.

Compute ∇·f:

In spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Since f_r = 1/r², this becomes:

(1/r²) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)] = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

Wait, but that's zero. So that would suggest that ∇·f is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it has a delta function. Because the function isn't differentiable at r=0, and the divergence is a delta function there.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, and it's a delta function there. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume of the sphere is the integral of 4π δ³(r) over the sphere, which is 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f over the volume equals the flux through the surface. So the flux through the sphere of radius R is 4π R². But according to the divergence, it's 4π. That can't be right unless I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the calculation of the divergence. Let me think again. Oh wait, the standard divergence in spherical coordinates for a purely radial field is ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

So f_r is 1/r². So r² f_r = 1, derivative is zero. So the divergence is zero. But that's only when r ≠ 0. At r=0, the function isn't defined, but in reality, the divergence is a delta function.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to think about this is that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, but it's a delta function, so ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). So the integral becomes 4π times the volume integral of δ³(r), which is 4π × 1. So the volume integral of ∇·f would be 4π.

But then according to the divergence theorem, the surface integral (flux) should also be 4π. However, when I computed the flux earlier, I thought it was 4π R². But perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let me compute the flux again. The flux is ∫ (f · dA) over the surface. The vector field f is (1/r²) r_hat.

dA is r² sinθ dθ dφ r_hat, so f · dA is (1/r²) * r² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ.

Integrate this over the sphere. The integral becomes ∫ (sinθ dθ dφ) from 0 to pi and 0 to 2pi.

The integral over theta would be ∫ sinθ dθ from 0 to pi, which is 2. The integral over phi is ∫ dφ from 0 to 2pi, which is 2pi. So the flux is 2 * 2pi = 4pi. Oh! So earlier, I thought it was 4pi R squared, but that's incorrect because when R is the radius, the vector field is 1/(R²) on the surface, but wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The vector field is f(r) = 1/r² r_hat, so on the surface of radius R, f(r) is 1/R² r_hat. Then, f · dA is (1/R²) * (r_hat · r_hat) * (R² sinθ dθ dφ). Because dA is R² sinθ dθ dφ times r_hat. So f · dA is (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ.

So the flux is the integral of sinθ dθ dφ over the sphere, which is 4π, as I just found.

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f is equal to the surface flux, which is 4π. But earlier, I thought the divergence is zero except at the origin, implying that the integral is 4π. So that aligns.

So the problem is asking for the integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R. So the answer would be 4π, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. The options are:

A)4π

B)1

C)4/3 π R

D)0

So according to this, the correct answer is A)4π.


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)**, which is purely radial and has a magnitude **f(r) = 1/r²**. The field is defined in spherical coordinates, and the goal is to compute the integral of **∇ · f** over the volume of a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence of the Vector Field**:  
   In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a purely radial vector field **f = f_r(r) r_hat** is given by:  
   $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right). $$  
   Substituting **f_r = 1/r²**, we compute:  
   $$ r^2 f_r = r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = 1, $$  
   and  
   $$ \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0. $$  
   Thus, **∇ · f = 0** everywhere except at the origin. At the origin, the divergence is proportional to the Dirac delta function, **∇ · f = 4π δ³(r)**, because the field behaves like a point source.

2. **Volume Integral of the Divergence**:  
   The volume integral of **∇ · f** over the sphere of radius **R** is:  
   $$ \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_V 4\pi \delta^3(r) \, dV. $$  
   Since the delta function integrates to 1 over any volume containing the origin, the result is:  
   $$ \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi. $$  

3. **Consistency with the Divergence Theorem**:  
   The divergence theorem states that the volume integral of **∇ · f** is equal to the flux of **f** through the surface of the sphere. The flux is computed as:  
   $$ \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_S \frac{1}{r^2} r^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \int_S \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi. $$  
   The angular integrals yield **4π**, confirming that the flux is **4π**, which matches the result of the volume integral.

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of **∇ · f** over the sphere of radius **R** is **4π**, which corresponds to option **A**.
