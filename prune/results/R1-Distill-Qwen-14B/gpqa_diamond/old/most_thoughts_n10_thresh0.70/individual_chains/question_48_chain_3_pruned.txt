Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.

So, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? It's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating this with bromine, which is Br2. Hmm, what does bromine do to ketones? Oh wait, I think that when ketones like cyclohexanone react with bromine under certain conditions, they undergo a bromination. But wait, ketones typically don't react with bromine by themselves. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Oh, wait! Maybe it's the cyclic ketone undergoing some kind of addition reaction. Or perhaps it's a different type of reaction. Oh, wait, I think I might be confusing this with something else. Oh wait no, maybe it's about the enol form. Because ketones can form enols, which are more reactive. So maybe cyclohexanone is reacting via an enolate or some kind of conjugate addition. Alternatively, I recall that when ketones are treated with bromine, they can undergo a bromohydrination. Wait, is that right? Or is that more for alkenes? Oh wait, no, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. So maybe I'm thinking of the wrong reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing this up. Another possibility: maybe the reaction is
