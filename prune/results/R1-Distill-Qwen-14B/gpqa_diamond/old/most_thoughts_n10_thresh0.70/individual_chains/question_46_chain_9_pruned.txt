Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic mixture. I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis, but I'll try to think it through.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the structure must have a chiral center. Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene. The pent-1-ene part is a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure should be CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₂?) Wait, wait. No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, maybe it's CH₂=CHCH(CH2CH3)? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pentane has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Adding a methyl group at carbon 3 would make it CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, because 3-methyl pent-1-ene would have the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait. Let me number the carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Or is that pent-1-ene with a methyl on C3? Hmm, maybe I need to correct that. Alternatively, maybe it's (E) and (Z) isomerism, but since it was racemic, perhaps there's a stereocenter?

Wait, racemic implies a chiral center. So the molecule must have a stereogenic carbon. Let me see. The structure of 3-methylpent
