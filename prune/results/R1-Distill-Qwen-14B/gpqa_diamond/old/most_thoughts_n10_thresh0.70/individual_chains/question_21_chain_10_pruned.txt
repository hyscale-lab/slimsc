Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two main types: constitutional (which differ in the arrangement of atoms) and stereoisomers (which have the same arrangement but different spatial arrangements). 

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, let's tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which one doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures (like keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes). For tautomerism to occur, the compound must have an H that can move, usually adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure, right? It's similar to benzene but with two ketone groups. Let me visualize it: it's a six-membered ring with two oxygen atoms, each in a carbonyl group. The positions are para (1,4) or ortho (1,2), but benzoquinone is usually para. So, does it have H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups? The ring is aromatic, so each oxygen is double-bonded, and the ring's carbons are sp² hybridized. So the carbons next to the carbonyl are each bonded to two other carbons and an oxygen. Do those carbons have any H's? Wait, in the structure, each of those carbons is double-bonded to O, so they might not have H's. Or wait, the ring structure—each carbon in the ring is connected to the next, and the carbonyl oxygens are attached. So in the benzene-like structure, each carbon in the ring has one substituent (the carbonyl O). So the positions adjacent to carbonyl groups (the alpha positions) don't have H's because they are part of the aromatic ring. So, no H's to shift. Therefore, benzoquinone can't tautomerize, right? Because there's no H adjacent to the carbonyl for the keto-enol shift.

Wait, but wait—another possibility: is there another possibility where a H might be present? Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up with something else. Wait, another thought: if the ring is such that the carbonyl groups are adjacent, like in a 1,2-diketone, then maybe the structure could allow tautomerism. Oh, wait, no, benzoquinone is 1,4-diketone in the ring. So the two carbonyl groups are across from each other. The positions next to each ketone would be in positions 2 and 6 (assuming 1 and 4 are the ketones). But in an aromatic ring, those positions are all double-bonded, so the adjacent carbons can't have H's attached because they're part of the ring, right?

Wait, maybe I should think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each of those is a carbonyl group. So between each ketone are two CH₂ groups. So the structure is O=C-(CH₂)-O=C-(CH₂)-O=C- in a ring. So each ketone is separated by a CH₂ group. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha carbons) are CH₂ groups. That means each alpha carbon has two H's attached. So those H's are in positions that could possibly participate in tautomerism. Because each alpha carbon is connected to a carbonyl group and has H's, so they can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would exhibit tautomerism.

Wait, but wait—tautomerism usually requires that the H is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups has two adjacent CH₂ groups (because it's a trione, so three carbonyls in a six-membered ring). Each of those CH₂ groups is between two carbonyls. So each CH₂ would have two H's. But wait, I think that in a trione like that, the structure is O=C-CH₂-CO-CH₂-CO-CH₂- connected in a ring. So each of the CH₂ groups is between two ketones. So each of those CH₂ groups has two Hs. So, for tautomerism, say, one of the H's in CH₂ could shift to the carbonyl, but wait, would that be possible?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Tautomerism typically occurs when a compound has a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a diketone like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, I think that's where tautomerism occurs. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, all the adjacent carbons are CH₂, which have H's. So the compound can undergo tautomerism, right?

So, part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Benzoquinone (which is 1,4-benzoquinone) has two carbonyl groups opposite each other in the ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring and thus don't have H's attached. So they can't undergo tautomerism. Whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls, which do have H's, so it can tautomerize.

Therefore, A is the compound that doesn't show tautomerism. So for part A, the answer is either benzoquinone (A) or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (the other option). Wait, the question asks which doesn't show tautomerism. So benzoquinone doesn't, and cyclohexane trione does. So the correct A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Benzoquinone: the structure is a
