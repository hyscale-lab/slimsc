Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and a calibration curve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. 

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it serially and ran qPCR on three technical replicates each time. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means it's perfect amplification—so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember that in qPCR, the slope of the calibration curve is related to the efficiency. The formula I think is slope = log(e) / log(10) multiplied by -1. Or wait, the standard formula is y = mx + b, where m is the slope. For a 100% efficient PCR, the calculation for the slope would be based on the formula. Let me recall: the expected slope when efficiency is 100% (which is 2, because each cycle doubles the DNA) is -3.3219... So the slope here is -3.3, which is very close. That makes sense because the efficiency is 100%, so it's spot on.

Looking at the data, the Ct values for each concentration are in triplicates. For example, 100,000 copies give Ct around 34, and each dilution (10x less) increases the Ct by about 3.3. Let me see: 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10-fold decrease, and the Ct goes from 33.9 to 30.6. The difference is around 3.3 cycles, which aligns with the slope. Similarly, 10,000 to 1,000 is another 10-fold, Ct goes from 30.6 to 27.3, again a 3.3 difference. So each 10-fold dilution increases Ct by 3.3, which is exactly what the slope suggests.

But wait, the question is about the discrepancies in the results. Oh, the title says "which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results." Hmm, so he's seeing that the Ct values are consistent with the dilutions, but why are the options suggesting something's wrong?

Looking at the options:

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No, that's not true. qPCR is used for quantification. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Ct values are not in agreement with target nucleic acid. But in his case, the Ct values do agree because each 10-fold dilution gives a 3.3 Ct increase. So B is not correct.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, ten-fold should be exactly 3.3 cycles when efficiency is 100%. So that can't be it. Unless perhaps each dilution step is more than ten-fold? Or maybe the dilution steps are not correct. Wait, but the data shows each
