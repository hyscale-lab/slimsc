Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which compound it is based on the spectral data provided. Let me go through this step by step.

The question says that a chemist found a white solid in a bottle and gathered some spectral data. The options are A to D, all of which are different chlorinated aromatic compounds. I need to use the mass spec, IR, and NMR data to identify which one is correct.

First, let's look at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%). Another peak is at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, so the molecular formula probably has a molecular weight around 156. The 158 suggests maybe there's some kind of adduct, like a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has isotopes at around 35 and 37 Cl. So perhaps the molecular ion has a Cl in it, and the 158 could be the M+2 peak, which is typical for Cl-containing compounds because each Cl atom adds about 2 mass units on average. So the formula should include Cl.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but aldehydes have strong peaks around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretch as well, but the broad peak is more likely an O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid, as they have broad O-H stretches. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde with an -OH group, but the O-H would be a broad peak, but aldehydes typically have sharp peaks elsewhere.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): A singlet around 11 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, wait. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes they can be higher. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12 ppm, often as a broad peak. But in this case, it's a singlet, so maybe it's an aldehyde. Or maybe an acidic proton, like in a phenolic group? No, phenolic protons are usually around 5-7 ppm. Wait, no, that's for aromatic protons. Phenolic OH can appear downfield, but more like 5 ppm or so. Hmm, maybe it's a carbonyl group with an adjacent O-H. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the COOH proton is around
