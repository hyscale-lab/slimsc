Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The question is about the ratio of the flux (number of neutrinos per cm² per second) in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The setup is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago, but all other reactions continued normally. I need to find the ratio F1/F2.

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then in pp-II, the deuterium fuses with a proton to make tritium, and finally in pp-III, the tritium fuses with a proton to make helium-4. So if pp-III stops, that specific part of the chain isn't contributing anymore.

But how does this affect neutrino production? Solar neutrinos are mainly produced in the proton-proton chain. The dominant neutrino production comes from the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the CNO cycle, right? Or wait, is that correct? No, wait. The main neutrinos come from the pp chain, specifically the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch and the main pp branch which produces boron-8 (I think). 

Oh, right, wait. The main pp chain produces boron-8, which then decays into two helium-3 nuclei, emitting a neutrino in each decay. So each boron-8 decay produces about 8 neutrinos (I think 7 or 8 per decay, but the exact number isn't critical for this ratio). So if pp-III stops, does that affect the production of boron-8?

Wait, let me think. The pp-III branch is when tritium (T) captures a proton to form helium-4. So, the main pp chain goes: proton + proton → deuterium (pp-I), then deuterium + proton → helium-3 (pp-II), and then two helium-3 can combine to make boron-8 (pp-III?), or alternatively
