Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reagents. I need to figure out which sequence correctly builds the target molecule.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. 

Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (Câ‰¡CH). The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group, and the other is a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). So the structure is a bit complex, but I think I can break it down.

Let me think about the target structure. The aldehyde group is on a cyclohexane ring. Attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde is a hydroxymethyl group, which is connected to another cyclohexyl group. So that carbon (the one with the aldehyde) has two substituents: a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group and the aldehyde. Wait, actually, looking closer, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That would mean that the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1: a methyl group that's connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxy group. And the same ring has a carbaldehyde group, which is also at position 1? Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the aldehyde is on a different position. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl connected to another cyclohexane, and there's an aldehyde group on the same ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So we have a triple
