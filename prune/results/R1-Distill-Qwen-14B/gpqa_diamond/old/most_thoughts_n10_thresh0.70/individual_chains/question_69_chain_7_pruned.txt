Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that a particle X^0 decays into Y^+ and Z^- with a proper lifetime of τ0 = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy of the particles in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. 

Wait, right, when particles decay, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime because of time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime τ would be γ times τ0, where γ is the Lorentz factor. 

But to find γ, I need the velocity of the particle. Oh yeah, because γ = gamma = E/(m c²) perhaps? Wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c squared. So gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, units, right. Let me think. 

The energy E is given as 27 GeV. The mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41, approximately. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, because 3.41 *7 is 23.87. 27 minus that is 3.13. So 3.41 * 0.9 is 3.069. So 3.41 *7.9 is 27. So gamma is approximately 7.9. Wait, or is it 27/3.41? Let me compute that exactly. 

3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 27 minus 23.87 is 3.13. 3.41 * 0.9 =3.069. So 0.9 of 3.41 is 3.069, which is a bit more than 3.13? No, 3.069 is less than 3.13. So 3.41 * 7.9 =7*3.41 +0.9*3.41=23.87 +3.069=26.939. Which is very close to 27. So gamma is about 7.9. 

So γ ≈ 7.9. So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ0 =7.9 *8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.9 *8 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 s, which is 6.32e-15 seconds. 

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because τ0 is the proper lifetime, which is measured in the particle's rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So the decay length would be the velocity of the particle multiplied by this τ. Because in the time τ, the particle will travel a certain distance L = v * τ. 

So I need to find the velocity v of X^0. Since gamma is 7.9, and gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), I can find beta, which is v/c. 

Beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2). So beta^2 = 1 - (1/(7.9)^2). Let's compute that. 7.9 squared is approximately 62.41. So 1/62.41 is approx 0.016. So 1 - 0.016 is 0.984. So beta is sqrt(0.984). Let's approximate sqrt(0.984). Well, sqrt(0.98) is approximately 0.99, because 0.99^2 is 0.9801. So maybe around 0.992. Let me compute more accurately. 0.992^2 is 0.984064. Oh, that's very close. So beta is about 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992 c. 

So now, the decay length L is v * τ. So v is 0.992 c, and τ is 6.32e-15 s. Let's compute that. c is 3e8 m/s. So, multiply 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.32e-15 s. 

Calculating that: 0.992 *3e8 is approximately 2.976e8 m/s. Multiply by 6.32e-15 s: 2.976e8 *6.32e-15 = let's compute 2.976 *6.32 = about 18.82. Then 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7. So 18.82e-7 meters. Which is 1.882e-6 meters. 

Wait, but the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". Hmm, I think this relates to the probability that the decay occurs within a certain distance. So the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^{-t/τ}, where t is the proper time. Wait, but the lab frame time is τ, the dilated lifetime. So perhaps the average path length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau0. Because tau is gamma tau0. Wait, wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau0, so the average path length is v gamma tau0. Which is beta c gamma tau0. 

Wait, so perhaps my earlier calculation was correct. Because L = beta c * gamma tau0. So with beta and gamma as calculated, so 0.992 *3e8 m/s *7.9 *8e-16 s. Wait, perhaps I should recalculate that. Let me do it more accurately. 

Wait, another approach: beta gamma c tau0. So beta is 0.992, gamma is7.9, c is3e8 m/s, tau0 is8e-16 s. 

So beta gamma =0.992 *7.9 ≈7.83. 

Multiply by c: 7.83 *3e8 m/s =2.349e9 m/s. 

Multiply by tau0: 2.349e9 *8e-16 s = (2.349 *8) *1e-7 m. 2.349 *8 is approx 18.792. So 18.792e-7 m, which is 1.8792e-6 m. So about 1.88e-6 m. 

Hmm, but the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think the idea is that you can only observe the decay if the path length is longer than the resolution of the bubble chamber. Wait, no, the bubble chamber's resolution determines how accurately you can measure the decay point. But the decay could happen anywhere along the path. So the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length is given by the decay probability. 

Wait, the fraction of decays observed depends on the decay length. If the decay length is L, then the probability that the decay occurs within a certain distance would be approximate, but I think the question is about the average path length. Because if the resolution is equal to the average path length, then you can observe about 37% decays (since the decay follows an exponential distribution; P=1 - e^{-1} ≈ 0.632, but wait, no, wait, the average path length is lambda, and the probability to decay within a distance x is 1 - e^{-x/L_avg}.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So the average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau0, which as we calculated is about 1.88e-6 meters. 

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution must be such that 30% of decays occur within that resolution. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. 

Alternatively, maybe the idea is that the bubble chamber has a spatial resolution. If the decay happens over a certain path length, and the detector's spatial resolution is the minimum length it can detect
