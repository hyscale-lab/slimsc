Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to statistical mechanics and partition functions, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the question is about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). We need to find Z, which is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT).

Hmm, let me think. Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe some of them are equivalent in energy. Let me enumerate all possible states and calculate their energies.

Wait, but that might take a while. Is there a smarter way to approach this? Maybe by considering the possible values of the interactions.

Each of the three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be either +1 or -1. So each pair contributes either 1 or -1. But the sum inside the brackets is what's being multiplied by -J.

Let me compute the energy for each possible state. Alternatively, perhaps group the states by their energy. That is, find all the states that have the same E and then sum their Boltzmann factors.

So, let's list all 8 possible states and compute their E values.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3), where each S is ±1.

1. (+1, +1, +1):
   Compute S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum = 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. (+1, +1, -1):
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum = 1-1-1 = -1. E= -J*(-1) = J.

3. (+1, -1, +1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum = -1+1-1= -1. E= J.

4. (+1, -1, -1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum = -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

5. (-1, +1, +1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum = -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

6. (-1, +1, -1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum = -1+1-1= -1. E= J.

7. (-1, -1, +1):
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum =1-1-1= -1. E= J.

8. (-1, -1, -1):
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum =3. E= -3J.

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the sum for some states. Let me check them again.

Wait, for state 2: (+1, +1, -1).
S1S2 = 1*1 = 1.
S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1.
S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1.
Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. Correct.

Similarly for state 3: (+1, -1, +1).
S1S2= +1*-1 = -1.
S1S3= +1*+1=+1.
S2S3= (-1)*+1 = -1.
Sum: -1+1-1= -1. E= J.

Same for state 4: (+1, -1, -1).
S1S2= +1*-1= -1.
S1S3= +1*-1= -1.
S2S3= (-1)*-1=1.
Sum: -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

State 5: (-1, +1, +1).
S1S2= -1*+1= -1.
S1S3= -1*+1= -1.
S2S3= +1*+1=1.
Sum: -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

State6: (-1, +1, -1).
S1S2= -1*+1=-1.
S1S3= -1*(-1)=1.
S2S3= +1*(-1)= -1.
Sum: -1+1-1= -1. E= J.

State7: (-1, -1, +1).
S1S2= (-1)*(-1)=1.
S1S3= (-1)*+1= -1.
S2S3= (-1)*+1= -1.
Sum: 1-1-1= -1. E= J.

State8: All -1s.
Sum is 1+1+1=3. E= -3J.

So, looking at all the states,

- The two extreme cases (all +1s and all -1s) have E= -3J.
- The other six states have E= J.

So, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

Each state contributes exp(-β E_i), where E_i is the energy of state i.

So for the two states with E= -3J, each contributes exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3βJ).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, beta is 1/(kT), so exp(-β E) is the Boltzmann factor.

So for E = -3J, -β E is 3β J.

So each of these two states contribute exp(3β J) each.

For the six states with E= J, each contributes exp(-β * J) each.

So the partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}, which doesn't match.

Wait, wait, because exp(-β E), so E is -3J for the two states, so -β E is 3 J β.

Wait, no:

Wait, E is -3J. So, exp(-β E) = exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J).

So the contributions are:

Two states: each exp(3β J) → 2 exp(3β J).

Six states: each exp(-β * J) → 6 exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 exp(3 β J) + 6 exp(-β J).

Looking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which is exactly this. So that's option B.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → which I don't think so.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → yes, which matches what I have.

Wait, but let me make sure. Did I compute the energies correctly?

Wait, for the state where all three spins are up, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

Each product S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 is 1. So sum is 3. E = -J * 3 → -3J.

So the
