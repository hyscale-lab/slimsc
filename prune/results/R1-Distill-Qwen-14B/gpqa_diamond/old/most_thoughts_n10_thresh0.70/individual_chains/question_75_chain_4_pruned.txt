Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about why a transgenic mouse model isn't expressing the protein as expected. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a researcher trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein in mice. They added an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein. Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence, they noticed an issue.

Wait, the problem must be in the coding sequence somewhere. Let me think about the possible options. The options provided are A to D. Let's go through each.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So HA tag is a specific peptide sequence. If there's a mutation, the tag might not be recognized. But would that prevent overexpression? Well, the HA tag is for affinity purification. If it's not there, the protein might not bind the antibody used for purification, making it hard to detect. But the question says the overexpression isn't happening. So maybe it's not A.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. But looking at the sequence, I should check for in-frame stop codons. Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets. Let's scan through the sequence. Hmm, I'm seeing a lot of codons. Looking at the end: ...GTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, looking near the end, there's a TGA. Let me count: ...AAAAAGTCTTGAACGTGG... Oh, TGA is a stop codon. So the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop. But wait, the question says the plus strand's sequence is from 5' to 3'. So the coding sequence would start with ATG and end with a stop.

Wait, the last part of the sequence is ...GTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. So the last few bases are GAGTGA. Breaking that into codons: GAG is a codon (probably glutamic acid), then TGA is a stop. So the construct includes a stop codon at the end, which is correct. But perhaps it's appearing earlier?

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct should start with the HA sequence, then GADD45G. Let me see where the HA tag comes into play. The HA tag is added to the coding sequence. So the construct would be: HA followed by GADD45G coding.

But in the given sequence, the start is ATG, which is the start codon. So the
