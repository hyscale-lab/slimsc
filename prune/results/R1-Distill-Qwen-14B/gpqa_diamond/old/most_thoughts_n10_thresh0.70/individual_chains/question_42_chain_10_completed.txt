Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think is transit timing variations. But I don't think that part matters for the problem. The key points are about their equilibrium temperatures, mass ratios, and orbital periods, and we need to find how much larger Planet3's orbital period is compared to Planet1.

The given data:
- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 (T1/T2) is about 1.4.
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 (T2/T3) is about 2.3.
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 (M1/M2) is approximately 1.15.
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 (M2/M3) is about 1.35.
- Albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth.

We need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. So, Period3 / Period1 = ?

Hmm. Let's think about what affects the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period. 

First, equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is given by the balance between the incoming starlight and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D^2 ) ]^(1/4 ), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).

But since all planets are around the same star, L and σ are constants. Also, albedo a is the same for all, so the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance D. So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). 

Wait, no, let me correct. Since T is proportional to [ ( L (1 - a) ) / D^2 ]^(1/4 ), which is T ∝ (1/D^(1/2)) ), because (1/D^2)^(1/4) is 1/D^(1/2). So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So, if T1/T2 = 1.4, then sqrt(D2/D1) = T1/T2. Because T1 = (1/sqrt(D1)) * const, T2 = (1/sqrt(D2)) * const. So, T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So, sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Wait, wait, let me think again. If T1 is higher than T2, that would mean Planet1 is closer to the star, right? Because higher T implies smaller D. So D1 < D2. So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then D2 = (T2/T1)^2 * D1. Because from T1=1.4 T2, so T2 = T1 / 1.4. Then, since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so T2 = T1 * sqrt(D1/D2). Or wait, let me write the ratio:

T1 / T2 = [ (1/sqrt(D1)) / (1/sqrt(D2)) ) ] = sqrt(D2/D1).

So, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

So, 1.4 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Square both sides: 1.96 = D2/D1 → D2 = 1.96 D1.

So, Planet2 is 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3=2.3. So, applying the same formula.

T2/T3 = sqrt( D3/D2 )

So, 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2)

Squaring: D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 → 5.29. So D3 =5.29 * D2.

Now, substituting D2 from earlier, D3 =5.29 * 1.96 D1 = let's compute that.

1.96 *5.29 = let's calculate.

1.96 *5 is 9.8, 1.96 *0.29 is about 0.5684. So total is approximately 10.3684. So D3 ≈10.3684 D1.

So, the distances are D1, 1.96 D1, and approximately 10.3684 D1.

Now, we need to find the orbital periods. The formula for orbital period is from Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3, where a is the semi-major axis (distance D), M is the mass of the star.

But wait, in this problem, the planets orbit a star, so the mass of the star is much larger than the planets. So, the mass of the star (M) is the same for all three planets. So, Kepler's law for each planet is P^2 proportional to a^3. So, P ∝ a^(3/2).

But wait, the mass ratio given is between the planets themselves, not the star. Oh, right, the problem gives the mass ratios of the planets. But for Kepler's third law, the mass of the star dominates, so the planet masses are negligible. So, the mass of the star is the same for all three planets, which implies that the period depends only on the distance.

So, Kepler's law for each planet: P1^2 ∝ D1^3, P2^2 ∝ D2^3, P3^2 ∝ D3^3.

So, taking the ratio of periods:

P3 / P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We already found D3/D1 is approximately 10.3684. So, (10.3684)^(3/2).

Calculating that: first, find sqrt(10.3684). Let me compute.

What's sqrt(10.3684)? Well, sqrt(10)=3.1623, sqrt(10.24)=3.2 (since 3.2^2=10.24). 10.3684 is a bit higher. Let's compute 3.2^2 = 10.24. 3.21^2 = (3.2 +0.01)^2 = 3.2^2 + 2*3.2 *0.01 + 0.0001= 10.24 + 0.064 + 0.0001= 10.3041. 3.22^2= (3.21+0.01)^2 = 3.21² + 2*3.21*0.01 + 0.0001= 10.3041 + 0.0642 + 0.0001=10.3684. Oh! So sqrt(10.3684)=3.22.

So, (10.3684)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1) * (10.3684)^(1/2) )= 10.3684 * 3.22.

Let me compute 10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22≈1.187. So total is approximately 33.387. So about 33.4.

Wait, but wait a second, the options don't have 33.4 as the only option. Let me look: option D is ~33.4, so that would be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. 

Wait, another approach: since P^2 is proportional to D^3, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2). From earlier, D3=10.3684 D1, so (10.3684)^(3/2) is indeed approximately 33.39. So, the factor is about 33.4. So, the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me cross-check using the mass ratios. Oh wait, the mass ratios are given between the planets themselves, but does that affect anything? Because Kepler's law depends on the mass of the star, not the planet. So unless the star's mass is varying, which it isn't, the planet masses don't affect the orbital period. So the given mass ratios (1.15 and 1.35) don't come into play here. So they're probably a distractor in the question.

So, the answer would be option D, ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperatures**:
   - The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance:  
     \[
     T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
     \]
   - From the given temperature ratios:
     - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) implies \( \sqrt{D_2 / D_1} = 1.4 \), so \( D_2 = 1.96 \, D_1 \).
     - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) implies \( \sqrt{D_3 / D_2} = 2.3 \), so \( D_3 = 5.29 \, D_2 \).

2. **Orbital Periods**:
   - From Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period is proportional to the \( 3/2 \)-power of the orbital distance:  
     \[
     P \propto D^{3/2}
     \]
   - The ratio of the periods is therefore:  
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D_3 = 10.3684 \, D_1 \) (from \( D_3 = 5.29 \, D_2 \) and \( D_2 = 1.96 \, D_1 \)), we calculate:  
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Breaking this down:
     - \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \),
     - \( (10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \times 3.22 \approx 33.4 \).

3. **Mass Ratios**:
   - The mass ratios between the planets (1.15 and 1.35) do not affect the orbital periods, as Kepler's Law depends only on the star's mass and the planet's orbital distance.

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1. This corresponds to option **D**.
