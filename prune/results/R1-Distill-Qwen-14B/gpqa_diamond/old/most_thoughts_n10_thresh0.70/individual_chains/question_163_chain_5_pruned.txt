Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. And then determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, right. So Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl, they should neutralize each other. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water. Let me write that down.

Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl to form FeCl3 and water. The balanced equation would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O

Wait, yeah, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so it needs three H+ ions from the acid to neutralize each OH-.

So the first step is to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have, then figure out how much HCl is needed to react with it completely.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1.008. So:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1.008 = 3.024
Total ≈ 55.85 + 48 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

Wait, let me double-check that. Oh yeah, because it's Fe(OH)3, so three hydroxide groups. So yeah, 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1.008) = 55.85 +3*17.008 = 55.85 +51.024=106.874 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass.

So moles = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Let me calculate that exactly.

0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

Since the reaction is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028075 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M HCl, which means 0.1 moles per liter, or 0.1 mol per 1000 cm³. So to find the volume needed, we can use moles = Molarity × Volume.

So volume (L) = moles / Molarity = 0.0028075 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028075 L = 28.075 cm³. Hmm, so that's close to 28.08 cm³. Let me check the options. Option C is about 28.05 cm³. So that's the volume part. But wait, the question says "minimum volume needed to prepare the solution", which probably means just the volume of acid needed. But wait, the total volume is 100 cm³. So wait, when we add the acid, the total solution is 100 cm³. So when we add V cm³
