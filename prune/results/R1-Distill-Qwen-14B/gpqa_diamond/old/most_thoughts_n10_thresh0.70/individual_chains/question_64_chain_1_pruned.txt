Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air, and only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes: the first has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second is Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60 grams, tube 3 gains 0.80 grams, and tube 2's weight doesn't change. After this, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The question is about finding the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out what the initial salts A and B are by analyzing the reactions that occur when the mixture is heated. The gases produced pass through those tubes, and each tube reacts with specific gases, which gives us clues about the composition of the gases.

Let me break down the problem:

1. When salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. The first tube, filled with Mg(ClO4)2, gains 3.60 grams. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water vapor. So, if tube 1 gains mass, it probably means that water was present in the gases. So the gas that reacted here is H2O.

2. The second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. Since the weight didn't change, that suggests that no gas reacted with it. Gases that would react with Ca(OH)2 are typically CO2, NH3, etc. So if the weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2 or NH3. Or perhaps the amount was so small that it didn't register? Hmm, but the third tube reacts, which is with copper.

3. The third tube contains red-hot copper. Copper can react with certain gases. For example, when H2S is passed over hot copper, it might not react much, but CO or H2 would. Alternatively, SO2 might react with copper, but at high temperatures, I think SO3 could react. Wait, maybe in this case, it's reacting with H2O? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something like H2S, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the tube with copper gained 0.80 grams. Let's think about possible reactions. One possibility is that the gas is H2S. When H2S is passed over hot copper, it can oxidize. Oh wait, H2S is a reducing agent. It can react with CuO, but in this case, the copper is in a different state. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, which can react with copper to form CO2 and Cu.

Wait, another thought: when CO reacts with Cu, perhaps it's the formation of metal carbonyls? Or maybe it's a redox reaction where CO is oxidized. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2. If H2 is passed over hot copper, it might not react, unless it's in a particular condition. Or maybe the gas is SO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the first tube, Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with H2O, so that's probably the first gas. The second tube didn't react, so perhaps the gas is not CO2 or NH3. Then, the third tube gained mass, which suggests a reaction. Let me think about possible reactions for each step.

Let me summarize the data:

- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2): gained 3.60g → probably H2O, as Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb water, increasing the mass.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution): no change → no CO2 or NH3, maybe?
- Tube 3 (Cu): gained 0.80g → perhaps CO reacting with Cu to form CO2 and Cu, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but after passing through all the tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at STP. Let's think about the volume. 2.24 L at STP is 1 mole (since 22.4 L is 1 mole at STP). So gas C is 1 mole.

So, let's try to determine the gases. 

First, the initial heating produces a mixture of gases. Let's say the gases are H2O, CO, and another gas.

Wait, but both tube 1 and 3 reacted, and tube 2 didn't. So the gases that
