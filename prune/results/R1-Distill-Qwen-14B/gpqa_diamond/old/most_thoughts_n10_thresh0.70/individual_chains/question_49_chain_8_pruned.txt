Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements are a type of pericyclic reaction where a sigma bond moves along with a pi bond. The examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are both [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. 

The problem has three parts, each involving a reaction under heat and possibly H+. I need to figure out the products A, B, and C from the given reactants and choose the correct option from A to D. Let's take each part one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form A. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like a compound with two methoxy groups on a central nitrogen, right? The structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH. But wait, that's ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. Or maybe it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH2OCH3)2NH, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? I think I need to draw this out. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2. So the molecule is something like (CH2OCH3)2NH. Wait, maybe it's (CH2OCH2)2N something. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look up the structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2, but that's 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine. 

But what's the reaction? It's reacting with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. The structure of but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH?
