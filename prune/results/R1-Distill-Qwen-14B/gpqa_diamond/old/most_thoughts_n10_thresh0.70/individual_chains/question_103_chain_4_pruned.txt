Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me draw its structure mentally. It looks like a benzene ring with substituents: a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. Then, attached to the ring is an ethanone group (so a ketone with a methyl group adjacent to the ring). Wait, no, ethan-1-one would be a ketone where the carbonyl is on carbon 1, so perhaps the substituent is a ketone group (like a C=O) attached to a CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is 1-(something)ethan-1-one, which would be (something) connected to a C=O where the C is attached to another CH2 group? Hmm, wait, maybe I should think about it as the ketone is at the end. So, it's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5 (bromo and nitro), and the ketone is attached at position 1 (ortho to the nitro? Or para?), but wait, the numbering might be different.

Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is connected to a ethanone group. So the ethanone is (CH2)1CO. Wait no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO, because ethan-1-one is acetone. So, the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5 (bromo and nitro), and the acetone group is attached at position 1. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other, and position 1 is adjacent to position 2, which would be ortho to position 3. Hmm, probably, but maybe I should think about the substituents on the ring.

So the target molecule is a benzene ring with a nitro group at the 5 position (assuming we number starting from the ketone), a bromo at 3, and an acetone group
