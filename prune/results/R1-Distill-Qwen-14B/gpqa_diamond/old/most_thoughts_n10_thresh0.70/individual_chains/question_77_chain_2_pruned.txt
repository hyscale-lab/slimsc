Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but let me think this through.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactant is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. So maybe this is a conjugate addition or some kind of organometallic reaction.

Wait, the molecule is a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a butenyl group. Let me draw that structure mentally. The group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy attached to a methyl group, which is attached to the benzene.

So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C=CH-CH2-? Wait no, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-C(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But with a methyl at position 3, so the structure is CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- but starting from the first carbon. So substituting at position 3, which is the third carbon from the end. So it would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So numbering from the double bond, position 1 is CH2, position 2 is CH, position 3 is CH2, position 4 is CH2-O-... Hmm, maybe I should think of it as a 1,5-diene for a Cope rearrangement. Wait, wait, the molecule given is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1
