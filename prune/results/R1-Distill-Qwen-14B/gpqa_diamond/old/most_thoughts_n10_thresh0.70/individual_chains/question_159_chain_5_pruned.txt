Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations and given cosmological parameters.

Alright, the quasar has a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, that might be the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to emission lines. Oh wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the rest frame. But if the observed wavelength is much longer, that would imply redshift.

Wait, but in this case, the peak is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared. Let me think: 790 nm is about 7900 angstroms. The Lyman-alpha line is about 1216 angstroms (121.6 nm). So if the observed wavelength is longer, that means it's redshifted. So the quasar's emission line has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. Let me think if that's part of the rest frame or observed. Oh, the question says the observations are in the near-infrared and optical, so the observed wavelength is about 790 nm. So that's the observed wavelength. So the rest wavelength is shorter. Let me calculate the redshift
