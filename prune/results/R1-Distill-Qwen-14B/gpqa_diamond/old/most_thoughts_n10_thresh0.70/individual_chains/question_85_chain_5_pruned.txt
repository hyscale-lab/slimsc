Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 has 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. The question is about their equilibrium temperatures ratio.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, right? The main formula I remember is the one where equilibrium temperature (Te) is proportional to (L / (16πσ D²) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe that's when considering a star's emission. But for a planet, the equilibrium temperature would be based on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, but the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out in the ratio.

But wait, the planets are orbiting the same star, so the star's luminosity is the same for both. So the main variables would be the distance of each planet from the star, because equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square of the distance.

But wait, the data given don't directly give the distance. Instead, we have information
