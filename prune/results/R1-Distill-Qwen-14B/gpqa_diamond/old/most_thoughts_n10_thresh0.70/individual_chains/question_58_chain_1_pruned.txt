Okay, so I have this science question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is asking which physical theory among the options never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that appear in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities temporarily so they can be subtracted or renormalized.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization, meaning it's safe at high energies without such techniques.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory which incorporates supersymmetry. I think string theories in general try to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. They propose that particles are not point-like but rather tiny strings vibrating. One of the features of string theory is that it deals with higher dimensions and perhaps avoids some of the infinities that other quantum field theories have. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Do they require regularization? Or maybe they don't because the underlying structure is different. Alternatively, maybe they do because they still involve quantizing something. Hmm.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to the electroweak theory. QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, making perturbative calculations feasible. But wait, regularization is often used in QCD calculations, especially when dealing with things like renormalization. So QCD does require regularization, right? Because like any quantum field theory, it has loop diagrams that lead to divergences.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, the interaction of light and matter. It's a well-established quantum field theory which is renormalizable. Renormalization involves dealing with infinities, which is a form of regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization techniques because of the divergences in things like electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. So if the question is about a physical theory that
