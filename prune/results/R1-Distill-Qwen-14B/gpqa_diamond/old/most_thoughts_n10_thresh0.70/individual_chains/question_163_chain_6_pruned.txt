Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, I remember that when you add an acid to a hydroxide, it should neutralize the hydroxide ions, right?

Alright, the problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how much of a 0.1 M strong acid is needed to dissolve this. The volume of the solution is 100 cm³. The options are A, B, C, D with different volumes and pH values.

First, I should probably calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The formula for iron(III) hydroxide is Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, and each OH is 17 g/mol. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Wait, let me double-check: Fe is 55.85, each OH is 16 (O) + 1 (H) =17. So yes, 3*17=51. 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

Given that we have 0.1 grams, moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me write that as approximately 9.36×10^-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but when you add a strong acid, it should react completely. The reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid provided is monobasic and strong. Let's assume it's something like HCl, which gives one H+ per molecule. The concentration is 0.1 M, so the volume needed can be found using moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Rearranging, Volume = moles / Molarity.

So Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, the problem says "minimum volume" so perhaps I should consider any possible excess, but I think the calculation is correct because the stoichiometry is 1:3, so 28 cm³ would just be enough. So looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. So the volume needed is about 28.05 cm³.

Now, what about the pH of the solution? After dissolving, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions and some excess H+ from the acid. Since the acid is strong, it will fully dissociate.

Let me calculate the concentration of H+ in the resulting solution. The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 liters.

The amount of H+ added is 0.002808 mol. But wait, the acid solution is 28.08 cm³, which is 0.02808 liters. The moles of H+ from the acid is 0.1 M * 0.0280
