Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with a different power of 1/plx. I remember that parallax is related to distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, at 2 parsecs, 0.5, and so on.

Now, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean the number of stars in a given volume is uniform? I think so. So the number density of stars doesn't depend on distance. So if you pick a shell at a certain distance, the number of stars in that shell depends on the volume of the shell.

The volume of a spherical shell depends on the radius squared. The volume of a shell between r and r+dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r² dr, assuming uniform density.

But how does this translate to parallax? Since plx = 1/r (parallax in arcseconds and r in parsecs), r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, I'm a bit confused with the differentials. Let me think: plx = 1/r, so dplx = - (1/r²) dr. So dr = - r² dplx. But since r is 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dr = - (plx)^-2 dplx.

Now, the volume element is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx and dr as above: 4π (1/plx)^2 * (- plx^-2 dplx) ). Wait, but the negative sign just indicates direction, which we can ignore since we're dealing with magnitudes here. So the volume becomes 4π * (1/plx^2) * (plxx^-2) ) dplx? Wait, no, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, let me substitute:

r = 1/plx, so r² = 1/(plx)^2.

dr is (since plx = 1/r), dr = -(1/r²) dplx = -(plx)^2 dplx. Wait, because dplx = - (1/r²) dr → dr = - r² dplx → since r =1/plx, dr = -(1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Putting it all together, the volume element dV is 4π r² dr.

So dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/plx² ) dplx → 4π (-1)/plx^4 dplx.

But since we're considering the absolute number, the negative just indicates direction, which we can ignore. So the volume element per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume shell is proportional to the volume, because the density is uniform. So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hmm, but wait the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So for each dplx, how many stars are there? So the number density in plx space is 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx would drop off as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but another approach: the
