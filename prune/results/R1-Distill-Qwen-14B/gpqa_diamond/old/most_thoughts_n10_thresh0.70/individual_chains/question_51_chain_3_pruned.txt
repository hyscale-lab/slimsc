Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says that a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Wait, so what's the setup again. The sphere is conducting and grounded. Conducting spheres have charges that can move freely. Since it's grounded, any induced charges can flow into the ground. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, when a conducting sphere is grounded, any excess charge can leave the sphere and go into the ground. So if I place a charge near it, the induced charges would be such that the sphere's net charge is zero, because any induced charge would be neutralized by the ground?

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think. When a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But because the sphere is grounded, the charges can flow in or out. So, for a grounded sphere, the presence of an external charge induces charges on the sphere, but since the sphere is connected to the ground, the induced charges can be neutralized, meaning the sphere's net charge remains zero, right?

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The sphere is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute. The external charge q induces opposite charges on the near side and same charges on the far side. But because the sphere is grounded, the far side's same charge can flow into the ground, so the sphere's total induced charge would be the negative of the near-side induced charge. Wait, no, because when an external positive charge is near the sphere, the electrons in the sphere will move to the near side (induced negative charge), and the far side will have a positive charge which can flow away to the ground. So the total charge on the sphere would be zero, because the ground takes the excess.

So the sphere remains at zero charge. So, the sphere doesn't have any net charge because it's grounded. So the induced charges balance each other and are neutralized by the ground.

But wait, wait, wait. No, that can't be right. Because the sphere is a conductor, any excess charge would be on the surface. But since it's
