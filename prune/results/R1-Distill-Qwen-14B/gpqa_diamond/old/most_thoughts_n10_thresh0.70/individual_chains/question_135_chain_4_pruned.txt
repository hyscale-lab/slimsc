Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this physics problem. Let's see what the question is about. It's about the decay of a boson X, right? The Lagrangian is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(ψ_f(y))(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that again. Oh wait, the interaction term probably is something like L = λ f f-bar X or similar because it's a Yukawa-type interaction. Wait, no. The given Lagrangian seems to involve ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So the interaction term is probably something like λ times f times ψ_f-bar times X times ψ_f. So that would imply that the boson X couples to fermions, and the coupling is proportional to f, which might be a Yukawa coupling.

Wait, more accurately, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f-bar (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So that's the interaction term. So, when you expand this, the term would be λ f ψ_f-bar X ψ_f, because the υ term is another constant, maybe the vacuum expectation value or something like that. But for decay purposes, the important part is that X couples to fermions with a coupling strength proportional to f.

Wait, but the specific form might not matter so much for the kinematic decay options. The key point is that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So, any fermion that X can couple to is a possible decay product, provided the energy is sufficient.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Now, the possible fermions that can result from its
