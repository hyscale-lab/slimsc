Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B) 3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what the index of hydrogen deficiency is. Wait, I think it's another name for the degree of unsaturation. Right, the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is a concept that describes the number of rings plus double bonds (each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two) in a molecule. So the question is asking about the DoU of the product after this reaction.

First, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like and what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Let me try to draw the structure of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the compound is a cyclohexene ring. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). Oh wait, the position 5 is a vinyl group, so it's CH2=CH attached to the ring. Also, the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3? Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would mean the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, I think. So the ring has a double bond, and the substituents are at 2 and 5.

Additionally, there's a carboxylic acid group. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is on which carbon? Wait, in the name, the 'enecarboxylic acid' part comes after the substituents. So the numbering must be such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Let me think.
