Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The structure is a benzene ring with three substituents. Let me number the positions. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (NOâ‚‚). So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering can affect the positions. Let me think again. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the three substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, which would be meta to each other in some way.

Wait, no, for benzene, the positions are adjacent. Wait, let me draw this out. So benzene is a hexagon. Let me imagine numbering it such that position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So that would mean that ethoxy (1) is adjacent to tert-butyl (2), which is adjacent to nitro (3). Wait, but wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row. So that would make the substituents in a meta arrangement? Hmm, no. Wait, in benzene, 1,2,3 positions are all adjacent in a row, so the substituents are in adjacent positions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of adding substituents. Because when you add groups to benzene, the order matters due to directing effects.

Now, each reaction step in the options is a different reagent, so I need to think about each step and what it does. The starting material is benzene.

The target molecule has
