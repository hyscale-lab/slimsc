Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. Hmm, I've done some spectroscopy before, but I'll have to think carefully.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the most intense peak at 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes split into M and M+2 peaks, which might be due to something like chlorine or bromine substitution. Chlorine has an atomic mass of about 35.5, but since it's a double bond or something else? Wait, no, the molecular ion shows the molecular weight. So, the main peak is M at 156, and M+2 at 158. That suggests that the molecule has a chlorine atom because Cl usually has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and about 25% for 37Cl. So when you have Cl in the molecule, the molecular ion can appear as M and M+2. But wait, the 35Cl would contribute to M, and 37Cl would make M+2. So the ratio between the two peaks would be about 3:1 maybe? Because the natural abundance is 3:1 (since 35Cl is ~75% and 37Cl is ~25%). So in the problem, the M is 156 (100%) and M+2 is 158 (32%). Hmm, 32% is roughly a quarter, which fits with the 3:1 ratio. So that suggests one Cl atom in the molecule. So the molecular formula would have a Cl somewhere.

Moving on to the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but the broad peak might be from an -OH group. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broad and strong, which fits the description. The carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm^-1, so 1720 is possible.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), that's a strong singlet. A singlet at 11 ppm is indicative of an aldehyde proton, but wait, wait. Wait, noâ€”wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but wait, maybe a carboxylic acid O-H? No, the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but it's a broad peak, not a singlet. Alternatively, an aromatic proton? No, aromatic protons are usually lower than that. Wait, wait, maybe it's an exchange broadened peak, but in the data, it's a singlet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton could appear around 9-10, but 11 is a bit high. Wait, maybe it's a phenolic OH? But phenolic OHs are usually in the 5-7 ppm range and broad. Wait, but this is a singlet at 11. Maybe it's something else. Wait, another possibility: a ketone doesn't have an H. Maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, perhaps the 1
