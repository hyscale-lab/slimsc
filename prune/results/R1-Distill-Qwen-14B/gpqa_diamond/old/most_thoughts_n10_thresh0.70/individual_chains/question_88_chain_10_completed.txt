Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about rotavirus and some immunology processes. Let me read through it again.

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. But they did find fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

Hmm. So what's happening here? I think Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're like immune hubs in the intestines. When the GFP-tagged proteins are delivered orally, they probably get processed by the immune system there.

The proteins were tagged with GFP, but some were destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is harsh; maybe the proteins don't survive, but perhaps some do. Those that make it through might get into the Peyer patches. Once there, the immune system would present them as antigens.

So, the next part is that they isolated proliferating cells. Proliferation suggests they're activated, maybe B cells or T cells. But the sequencing is about variable heavy chain genes, so I'm thinking B cells. Because when B cells are activated, they undergo processes that change their antibodies.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genesâ€”what causes that? I remember that during the immune response, especially in B cells, there's a process called somatic hypermutation. That occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. Somatic hypermutation introduces mutations in the genes encoding the B cell receptors, leading to more diverse antibodies. That's a key part of generating diversity after the initial antigen recognition.

Wait, other options: complement activation is about the complement system attacking pathogens, not directly about gene variability. Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that's more about the constant region. VDJ recombination is during the development of B cells in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region. But that happens during B cell development, not in response to an antigen.

So in this scenario, the B cells in the Peyer patches are responding to the rotavirus proteins. They're proliferating, which happens in germinal centers where somatic hypermutation occurs. That process increases the diversity of the antibodies, which explains the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

So the process is somatic hypermutation. The answer should be A.


The question involves an experiment where the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and delivered to mice via oral gavage. The experiment observes that some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Despite this, fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

Peyer patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the gut that play a key role in immune responses to orally delivered antigens. The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins likely bypassed stomach acid and intestinal mucus to reach these patches. Once there, the proteins are processed as antigens, activating B cells in the germinal centers of the Peyer patches. Proliferation of these B cells is a hallmark of their activation, and the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that generates diversity in the B cell receptor repertoire.

Among the options provided:

- **Somatic hypermutation** is the process by which B cells introduce mutations into their variable heavy chain genes during the immune response, leading to increased diversity in antibodies. This occurs in germinal centers and matches the observed high variability in the experiment.
- **Complement activation** refers to the complement system's role in attacking pathogens and is unrelated to the variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Class switching recombination** involves changing the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and does not explain the observed variability in the variable region.
- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the B cell receptor. However, this process does not occur in response to antigens and is not relevant to the experiment.

The most plausible explanation for the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in the germinal centers of Peyer patches during the immune response. 

Answer: A
