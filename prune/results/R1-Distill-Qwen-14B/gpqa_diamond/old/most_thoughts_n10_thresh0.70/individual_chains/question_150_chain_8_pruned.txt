Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde or ketone (1), plus maybe an ester or something else. Or maybe a ring and some double bonds.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high shift. Usually an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but it's a triplet. Wait, but aldehydes are usually singlets because they don't have neighboring Hs. Oh wait, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to something else? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substitution or coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic OH? No, phenolic OH is usually broader and maybe around 5 ppm. Wait, but the integration is 1H. Another thought: could it be a proton adjacent to an oxygen, like next to an aldehyde? Or maybe an aromatic proton that's deshielded. Or perhaps it's a ketone? No, ketones don't have protons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde with coupling to two other protons. Like if the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group. So the H could be coupled to two Hs on adjacent carbons. But that would make it a triplet? Wait, a triplet implies two neighboring Hs. So maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Let me think about that.

Next, 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Similarly, 6.51 ppm, d, 2H. So maybe two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets. So perhaps para-substituted benzene rings? Because in para substitution, the protons are usually split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Wait, but the 6.98 is more downfield than 6.51. So perhaps one ring has substituents that make the protons more deshielded. Like, maybe one ring is attached to an electron-withdrawing group, making the protons downfield.

Then, 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests exchange or maybe coupling with adjacent protons, but it's a singlet. Could be an aromatic ring with two protons in a para position, but maybe they're coupling to each other but it's a doublet. Wait, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe these are alkenyl protons. Or perhaps they're adjacent to an oxygen. Hmm.

The last peak is 3.66 ppm, d, 2H. That's probably two protons on a CH2 group. The doublet suggests they're next to another CH2. Maybe it's a CH2 next to an oxygen, like an ether or an alkoxy group. Or maybe adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together: the molecule likely has a benzene ring, another benzene ring (since the NMR shows aromatic signals), and an aldehyde group. Let's see, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene rings would take up 6 carbons each if there are two. Wait, but waitâ€”C8H9NO. Benzene is C6H6. Two benzene rings would contribute 12 carbons, which is way more than 8. So no, that can
