Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. 

Alright, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so M1 = 1.5 M2. Interesting, but I'm not sure how the mass plays into this yet. Maybe it's a red herring? Or maybe it's part of determining their temperatures somehow.

The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.9×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the problem says they found the same λ_max, so T1 = T2. That's a key point. So both stars have the same temperature. That simplifies things because I can relate their luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. 

Stefan-Boltzmann law says that Luminosity L is proportional to R² T^4. So L = 4π R² σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities will be (R1/R2)^2. 

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options include 2.25 as choice A. But wait, let me double-check if there are other factors.

Oh wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does this affect their luminosity? Wait, radial
