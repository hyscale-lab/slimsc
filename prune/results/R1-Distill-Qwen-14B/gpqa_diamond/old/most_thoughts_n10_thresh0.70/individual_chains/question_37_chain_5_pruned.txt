Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the number of 13C-NMR signals for compound E. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the starting material is propionaldehyde. I know propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. Right? So, it's an aldehyde with two carbons attached to the carbonyl.

The first reaction is with EDT and BF3. Wait, what's EDT? Oh right, EDT is ethyl diisopropyl tin, I think. So that's a type of reagent used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces aldehydes and ketones to alkanes, using Zn(Hg)/HCl, but wait, wait. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, BF3 is a Lewis acid catalyst. Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, maybe it's the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction? No, that's for ketones to secondary alcohols. Or wait, the first step is with EDT and BF3. Oh, wait, I think EDT is ethyl diisopropyl tin, which is used in the reduction of aldehydes to alkanes. So, propionaldehyde (RCHO) would become RCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So the aldehyde group is CHO. If it's being reduced to CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, wait. The aldehyde group is CHO. Reduction would convert that to CH2OH? No, wait, Clemmensen uses Hg and Zn to reduce aldehyde to CH2 groups. So propionaldehyde would become propane? Wait, no, propionaldehyde is CH2CH2CHO? Wait, no, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So an aldehyde group at
