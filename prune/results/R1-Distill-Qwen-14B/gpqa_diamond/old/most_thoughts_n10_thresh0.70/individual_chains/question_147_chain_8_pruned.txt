Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, right? And I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an annihilation process involving a proton and an antiproton annihilating to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, annihilation processes... I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, which is usually other particles. But in this case, they're producing these A particles. So I guess momentum and energy conservation must apply here.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe that means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the antiproton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², but it's moving slowly so its kinetic energy isn't too high.

The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum here. The initial system has the proton and antiproton. The proton is at rest probably? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some slow velocity. Or wait, maybe the setup is that the antiproton is moving, but the proton is at rest? Or perhaps both are moving? Hmm, not sure. Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low speed.

Wait, but in the initial state, the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving, so it has
