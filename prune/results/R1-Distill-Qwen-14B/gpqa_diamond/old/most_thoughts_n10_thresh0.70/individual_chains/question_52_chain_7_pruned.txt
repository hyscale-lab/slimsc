Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levelsâ€”level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So the Boltzmann factor comes into play here.

The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels as:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the populations of the two levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Wait, but the spots themselves are cooler, right? So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the star's average Teff is lower. But how does that affect the temperature in the photosphere where the Ti atoms are?

Wait, the question says that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So normally, without spots, the ratio is higher. The ratio is n1/n2, maybe? Because when spots are present, the ratio decreases. Let me think.

Wait, the ratio given is the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 compared to level 2. So it's n1/n2. So when the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So when the star doesn
