Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember something about dipole radiation from my electromagnetism class. Let me try to think this through.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the possible form of f.

So, what do I know about the radiation from a dipole? Oh right, the dipole radiation pattern is something like sin²θ. Wait, but wait, is that right? Or was it sinθ or something else? Hmm, I think it's sin squared theta. So the radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees, right? Because when θ is 90, sinθ is 1, so sin²θ is also 1. So maximum at the equator, minimum along the poles.

So the maximum power A would occur when θ is 90 degrees. But the question is asking about the fraction at θ=30 degrees. So the fraction would be f(30) divided by A, since A is the maximum.

Wait, but what's the exact function. Let me think about the dipole radiation formula. The power radiated by a dipole in the far field is proportional to (dipole moment)^2, and the angular dependence is (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2, or wait, another way. Oh, right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the intensity, which is proportional to (sin²θ) multiplied by some constants and the amplitude. So the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall. The radiated electric field for a dipole is E proportional to (1/r) (sinθ e^{i(kr - ωt)} ), but the intensity is proportional to E squared. So E² is sin²θ * something. So the intensity would be proportional to sin²θ. So the intensity as a function of θ is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, but I think it's a bit different. The exact formula for the intensity (or the power per unit area) from a dipole is something like (p²
