Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. So, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because our atmosphere absorbs it. So, how does this relate to redshift?

Redshift happens when the wavelength of light from an object is stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula for redshift z is (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So, z = (λ_obs - λ_emit)/λ_emit.

In this case, the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The clouds are absorbing this, but we need to detect it using optical telescopes. Optical telescopes work in the visible spectrum, which is longer wavelengths than UV. So, the absorbed light must be shifted into the visible range.

Wait, no. The absorption happens at the source's frame. So the quasar emits light, which passes through the hydrogen cloud. The hydrogen absorbs the Lyman alpha line, so we see a dark absorption line at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's spectrum. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, then this absorption line will shift to longer wavelengths.

So, for us to see this absorption line in the optical range (visible light), the wavelength after redshift must be less than around 4000 Angstroms, I guess? Because optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So if the Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms) is redshifted into the optical, what's the minimum redshift needed?

Let me calculate. The observed wavelength λ_obs must be greater than or equal to 4000 Angstroms (since 4000 is about the start of the optical in terms of wavelength; wait, actually, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, which is the violet end of visible light. So yes, that's a safe assumption for the lower limit.)

So λ_emit is 1216 Angstroms. We want λ_obs >= 4000 Angstroms. So, let me plug into the redshift formula.

z = (λ_obs - λ_emit) / λ_emit.

At the lower limit, λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms.

z = (4000 - 1216) / 1216.

Let me compute that: 4000 - 1216 is 2784.

2784 divided by 1216 is approximately 2.2857.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Because 1216 * (z+1) = λ_obs.

Wait, another way: λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z).

So, 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z
