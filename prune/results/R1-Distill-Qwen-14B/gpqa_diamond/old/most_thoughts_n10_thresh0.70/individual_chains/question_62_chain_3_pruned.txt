Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's see.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the structure probably has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, right? And then there's a carbaldehyde group. Wait, so maybe it's like a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde where one of the cyclohexane carbons is substituted with a group that's a cyclohexyl attached to a CH(OH) group, which is then connected to another cyclohexane. Hmm, not entirely sure, but maybe I can visualize it.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so that's like a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. So it's HC≡C-Cyclohexane. Or wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure would be cyclohexane with a triple bond coming off, like CH2-C≡C- attached to the ring? Wait, no, ethynyl is CH≡C- group. So the starting material is probably cyclohexane with a substituent that's an ethynyl group, meaning it's attached as a terminal alkyne.

So the target is a di-substituted cyclohexane with a hydroxymethyl group attached, which is itself connected to another cyclohexane ring, and an aldehyde group. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the main ring is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl group, and then another substituent as a carbaldehyde.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reactions. Let me think about the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

First, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Maybe the first step is a substitution or addition. Wait,
