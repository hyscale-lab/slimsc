Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this nuclear decay question. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about a nuclear decay process where two nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's and emit two E and two V particles. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It says that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with some maximum value Q, which I think is the endpoint.

Then there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is, how does the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles change in this new scenario?

Hmm. I remember that in decay processes, the type and number of particles emitted can affect the energy spectrum of the decay products. Especially when considering whether particles are massive or massless, and how that affects the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V), since V particles are presumably massive (as they're heavier and the initial nucleons are heavy), their emission would carry away some energy and momentum. The E particles might be like electrons or positrons, which have mass but are much lighter than the nucleons. So their energy spectrum is continuous because the emitted particles can share the energy and momentum in various ways.

Wait, but why is the E spectrum continuous in the original case? Oh right, in beta decay or similar processes, when a parent nucleus emits a beta particle (like an electron), the emitted electron can have a range of energies, hence a continuous spectrum. This is because the emitted electron and the antineutrino (or another particle) share the energy, so the electron's energy isn't fixed. But in this case, it's two E and two V particles emitted. So I guess multiple particles sharing the energy leads to a continuous spectrum.

Now, in the variant, instead of two V's, it's a single massless M. Massless means M has zero rest mass, so its energy is equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles, like photons). So M's emission would be similar to, say, a photon or gluon, but since it's exotic, perhaps it's a boson or something else.

In the original decay, the two V particles are massive. So they each carry away some energy and momentum, which depends on their masses. But in the variant, we have one M which is massless.

Wait, but what about the conservation of momentum? In the original decay, the two V's might carry off momentum in opposite directions, but now we have M which is a single particle. So the decay process must conserve momentum. Since the initial nucleus is heavy, perhaps at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the products must have total momentum zero as well.

In the original case with two V's, each V would have some momentum, and the E and B particles as well. But maybe that's why the E's have a continuous spectrum.

In the variant, the M is massless and is emitted along with two E's. So perhaps the decay products are 2B, 2E, and M.

Wait, the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So that's 2A decaying into 2B, two E's, and one M.

In the original scenario, 2V's are emitted. So the number of particles differs, but the main point is the nature of the emitted particles.

Now, the question is about the energy spectrum of the E particles. So in the original decay, E has a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. In the variant,
