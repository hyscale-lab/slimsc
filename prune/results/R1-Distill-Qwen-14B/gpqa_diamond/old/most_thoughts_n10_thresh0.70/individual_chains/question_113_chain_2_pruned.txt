Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound. The question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, maybe this compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, there are also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a ketone or maybe an ester or amide. But since we're dealing with options that include O and O2, maybe it's something like a ketone and an ester? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe conjugated with something else because of the IR peaks. For example, maybe it's an enol ether or a conjugated diene. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 could be a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, the methyl group is 15, but 45 is a larger fragment. Wait, 45 is the molecular ion for C3H7O (which would be 3*12 +7*1 +16= 36+7+16=60? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment like a ketone. Let me calculate: 45 is 45. So possible candidates: C3H7O (3*12=36 +7=43 +16=60? No, wait, 36+7+16=60? Wait, no: 3 carbons would be 36, 7 H is 7, O is 16. 36+7=43 +16=59. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Let's see: if it's a ketone, like (CH3)2CO, then the molecular weight would be (2*15) +12 +16 +12? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of possible fragments. Oh, wait, 45 could be from a propyl group with oxygen, like CH2CH2CO... No, maybe more accurately, the fragment could be C3H6O. Let's calculate that: 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 16=16. 36+6+16=58. Hmm, that's not right. Wait, what's 45? Maybe it's a COCH2CH2 group or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl plus some hydrogens. Wait, alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a carbonyl group. For example, a ketone or an ester. Let me think: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of the options, so perhaps the m/z 45 is a characteristic fragment.

Now, looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all are C6 with varying H and O.

The FTIR has O-H (from the broad peak) and C=O (from 1700). So if both an -OH and a carbonyl are present, possible structures could be esters, ketones with an -OH, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch, but also a strong peak around 1700. Esters also have a strong C=O. But the IR also shows a peak at 1650, which could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's conjugation with another group.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests an alkene. So the compound has an alkene and a carbonyl group, perhaps. Let's think about possible structures. For example, something like a vinyl ester, or a cinnamate, or maybe a molecule with an ester and an alkene.

The mass spec fragment at 45. Let me think about each option's possible fragments.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be an ester, like methyl something. The molecular formula would be C6H12O2, which is an ester, perhaps. The molecular weight is (6*12) +12 + (2*16) =72 +12 +32=116. So the molecular ion would be at 116. But the fragment is at 45. Maybe the ester group breaks into a smaller fragment. For example, if the ester is something like CH2CH2COO-R, the fragment could be the alkoxy part. Or, perhaps a more likely fragment is the carbonyl part. For example, if the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, we might get a fragment with the carbonyl group. For an ester, the fragment could be something like O-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass spec peak at 45 comes from a CH2CH2CO group. Let's see: CH2CH2CO has molecular weight 58 (12+12+16 + (each CH2 is 14, so maybe not). Wait, perhaps it's a smaller fragment. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think of possible functional groups. For instance, the fragment could be (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. What's the molecular weight of acetone? 3*12 + 6 +16 = 36 +6 +16=58. No, that's 58. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, 45 is a common fragment for something like a methyl group attached to something else. Or maybe the fragment is a ketone. Let me think: if it's a ketone, the fragment would include the carbonyl group. For example, a fragment like (CH2)2CO would be (2*12) + (2*2) +16=24+4+16=44. Close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CO group (32 +16=48? No. Wait, CH3CO is 44 (12*2 + (3*1 +1) +16=24 +4 +16=44). Hmm, maybe the fragment is 45. Another possibility: Maybe it's a (CH2)2O group. Let's see: (2*12) + (4*1) +16=24 +4 +16=44 again. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2=CHCO group. Let's calculate. CH2=CHCO would be 12*3 + (5 H) +16= 36 +5 +16=57. No. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with an oxygen, like CH2CH2CHO. Wait, that's 12*3 + 6 +16=36+6+16=58 again.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's look at each option and see what fragments they could produce.

Option D is C6H12O. That's a molecular formula where the degrees of unsaturation would be: (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so maybe an alkene and an -OH.

The FTIR has O-H (so -OH group) and a strong C=O. Oh wait, in option D, there's only one O. So the structure must have both O-H and C=O, but with only one O? That can't be possible because that would require two O's. So D is C6H12O. So if it's an alcohol and a ketone, but that would require two O's. Therefore, D can't be the answer because it has only one O. So we can eliminate D.

Now, the other options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. So maybe an ester group (which is an O-containing group), but that would account for two O's. So an ester would be O2.

Wait, the IR has a strong C=O at 1700, which is typical for esters. The broad peak around 3000 could be from an alcohol (but esters don't have -OH groups). Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone (C=O at ~1700) and an alcohol group (O-H at ~3300). So if the formula is C6H12O2, then that would have two O's, which could be a ketone and an alcohol. But wait, can a molecule have both an alcohol and a ketone group? I think so. For example, something like cyclohexanol with a ketone substituent. But then, the FTIR would show a broad O-H (the alcohol) and a strong C=O (the ketone).

But then the 1H
