Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about electron scattering experiments. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question gives me some phase shifts for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts are delta0=90 degrees, delta1=67, delta2=55, delta3=30, and delta4=13 degrees. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. And the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, especially for electrons, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the partial wave expansion comes into play here. The scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over all the angular momentum states, each contributing a term based on the phase shift.

The formula I think is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * (2l +1) * P_l(cosθ) ) ] for each l. But wait, since the problem specifies the incident beam direction, which I believe corresponds to θ=0 degrees. Because when the angle is zero, the particle just scatters forward, so cosθ is 1.

So for θ=0, the associated Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is... I think that's only non-zero when l=0. Because P_0(1)=1, and P_l(1)=0 for l>0. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because for l=0, P_0^0(x) is 1, and for higher l, like l>0, P_l(1) is also 1? Or is it zero? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The Legendre polynomials: P_0(x) is 1. P_1(x) is x. So P_1(1) is 1. Oh wait, but in the partial wave expansion, each term has P_l(cosθ), so when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) is... Wait, what's the form of P_l(x)? For l=0, x^0=1. For l=1, x. For l=2, (3x²-1)/2. At x=1, P_l(1) would be 1 for l=0 and 1 for l
