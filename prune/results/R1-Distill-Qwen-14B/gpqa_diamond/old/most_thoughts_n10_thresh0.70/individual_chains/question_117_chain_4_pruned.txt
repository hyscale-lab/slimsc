Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down. I remember that optical isomerism has something to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to them being chiral. Chiral molecules have a carbon with four different substituents, right?

Looking at the question, there are four compounds listed, and I need to figure out which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, and I have to pick the correct set.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
Hmm, the name is a bit long. Let me see. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6,6' have nitro groups. And it's a dimethyl ester of the dicarboxylic acid.

Wait, do biphenyls have the possibility of being chiral? Well, biphenyls themselves can have some kind of isomerism, but I think it's geometric. Oh wait, if the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then it would have optical isomerism.

Wait, the molecule has a central single bond between the two benzene rings. In such cases, the substituents can be trans or cis, but does that lead to optical isomerism? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it won't be chiral.

In this compound, at position 6 on each ring, there's a nitro group, and at position 2, a carboxylate ester group. So for each ring, position 2 is next to the connecting bond, and position 6 is opposite. Wait, but the substituents are in the same positions on both rings. So the two benzene rings are identical in their substitution, but is that creating a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if both rings have nitro in position 6 and carboxylate in 2, then the molecule might be symmetrical. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to biphenyl with substituents arranged such that it can't be a plane mirror. Wait, but if the substituents are symmetrical, then maybe the molecule is achiral. Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no internal plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and
