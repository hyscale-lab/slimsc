Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some mutants. Hmm, let's see. The situation is that there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. So, the plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then find which mutation would eliminate the compound.

So, the question is about which mutation would let them get rid of the anti-nutritional compound. The gene's structure is given, with exons and introns, and some mutations have happened in the first exon area. The target is to find which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function.

Looking at the options, all the mutants have changes in the first part of the gene. The intact gene, and each mutant, are given as DNA sequences. I need to compare them and see what's changed.

Let me write them out for clarity:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, each of these is a DNA sequence of the same gene but with some changes. The first part is the beginning of the gene.

The anti-nutritional compound is probably due to a functional gene product. So, if the gene is non-functional (mutated), the compound wouldn't be made. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's coding sequence, leading to a non-functional protein or no protein.

Looking at the sequences, the key is to see where the changes are and what type of mutation they are. Since this is DNA, the changes could be point mutations, insertions, deletions, etc. But looking at the sequences, I think all the mutations are point changes because each line seems to have the same length.

So, let's compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Starting with the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, looking at the first few codons:

Intact starts with ATG (which is the start codon, methionine). Then TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant 1: ATG (start), then TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe), then TAC ( Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), etc.

Wait, so in mutant 1, the second codon is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe). That's a change from Phe to Ser. Then the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). So, two amino acid changes.

But wait, is that in the same reading frame? Since it's DNA, the reading frame could be altered if there's a frame shift, but these are point mutations, so same frame.

But for the protein to be non-functional, the change would need to disrupt the coding sequence. Maybe a premature stop codon would do the trick.

Looking at Mutant 4: its DNA sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, let me look again. The intact gene's first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 4's first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ...

Wait no, the Mutant 4's sequence is written as:

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking that down:

ATG is the start. Then next is TT TAC GCT ACT... Hmm, but wait, maybe I should write them as triplets.

Wait, the given sequences are written as continuous strings, so let me split them into codons (triplets) to see the amino acids.

Intact gene first part:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, the first few codons are Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Glu, ...

Mutant 1:

ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, Met, Ser, Tyr, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Glu, ...

Mutant 2:

ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, the second codon is TCT (Ser), third is TAA (stop codon, since TAA is a stop). Oh wait, no, because the sequence for mutant 2 is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Split into triplets:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 

So, the second codon is TTC (Phe?), wait no, wait:

Wait, the entire sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

So, first triplet: ATG – Met.

Second triplet: TTC – Phe (because TTC is phenylalanine). Hmm, but wait, in the intact gene, the second triplet is TTT (Phe). So, in mutant 2, the second codon is TTC, which is also Phe. So no change there. Third triplet: TAA. TAA is a stop codon (trp in some cases, but TAA is a stop). Wait, no, TAA is a stop codon. So, the third codon in mutant 2 is TAA, which is stop. So the protein would terminate early here.

Wait, so in mutant 2, the first two codons are Met, Phe, then the third is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be Met-Phe-Stop. That's a very short protein, maybe just the start and then stop. So that would likely disrupt the gene function because the protein is much shorter.

But wait, if the gene's first exon has this, then the protein would be truncated. So perhaps mutant 2 would result in a non-functional protein.

Alternatively, let's look at other mutants.

Mutant 3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, first triplet: ATG (Met), second: TTT (Phe), third: TAC (Tyr). Then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr) in the intact gene. So, the fifth codon in the intact is ACT (Thr) becomes GTC (Val) in mutant 3. So, amino acid changes but not a stop.

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, the DNA sequence for mutant4 is:

ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

Split into triplets:

ATG TTC TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, Met, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr, Ser, Val, Glu...

Wait, the fifth codon in the intact gene is ACT (Thr), which in mutant4 is the same? Because the third triplet is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr) same as the intact.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write all of them again.

Intact gene:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1:
ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 

Mutant 2:
ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 

Mutant3:
ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 

Mutant4:
ATG TTC TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct.

Mutant4's DNA is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, splitting into triplets:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TAC (7-9), GCT (10-12), ACT (13-15), TCT (16-18), GTG (19-21), GAT (22-24), GAA (25-27), ...

Wait, so the first codon is ATG, second is TTT, third is TAC, fourth is GCT, fifth is ACT.

In the intact gene, the fifth codon is ACT, so same as mutant4. So what's different in mutant4? Let's see.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the numbers. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the first few bases:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So, the first 15 nucleotides of each:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCTGTGG...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCTGTGG...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCTGTGG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCTGTGG...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCTGTGG...

So, let's see:

Mutant2's third codon is TAA. TAA is a stop codon. So the gene would be cut short there, leading to a truncated protein.

Mutant4's fifth codon is ACT in the middle. So it's an amino acid change from something else? Wait, perhaps in the intact gene, the fifth codon is ACT, so in mutant4, is it also ACT? Looking at the 15th nucleotide.

Wait, in the intact gene, the fifth codon is ACT (positions 13-15): GGT ACT TCT.

In mutant4, the fifth codon is ACT as well? Or is it different?

Wait, let me count:

Intact: positions 1-15: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, after ACT comes TCT.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT... So, after TAC (3rd codon) is GCT (4th), then ACT (5th), then TCT (6th). So, same as intact in 5th codon. But wait, in the 4th codon, the intact has GCT (Ala), and mutant4 also has GCT. So, in mutant4, perhaps the 5th codon is the same. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a frameshift mutation. But looking at the sequences, they all have the same number of nucleotides, so it's point mutations, not frameshifts.

In that case, which mutation is likely to cause a loss of function? A change that introduces a premature stop codon.

Mutant2 introduces a TAA (stop) as the third codon. That would mean the protein stops after Met-Phe, which is early. So the resulting protein would be much shorter. This could disrupt the gene's function, perhaps eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

Mutant4: let's see, the 5th codon is ACT in both cases. So maybe it's a silent mutation? Or if not, perhaps it's a missense.

Wait, another approach: the goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the gene produces a compound, so if the gene is non-functional, it won't produce it.

So, the best way is to disrupt the gene. A frameshift would disrupt, but all these are point mutations. So a nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) would do that.

Looking at the options, only Mutant2 has a TAA stop codon in the third position.

Wait, but in the sequences, mutant2's sequence is:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the second codon is TTC (Phe), third is TAA (stop). So the protein would be Met-Phe-Stop. That's just two amino acids, so the protein is way truncated. That would likely cause a non-functional protein.

Other mutants:

Mutant1: changes Phe to Ser, Leu to Tyr. Probably a missense mutation, but the protein is still made.

Mutant3: changes the fifth codon from ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). So another missense.

Mutant4: perhaps the fifth codon remains the same. Let me see.

Mutant4's sequence after TAC (third codon) is GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc. So same as the intact gene from there. So, the mutation in mutant4 is only in the third codon (TAC) and perhaps the fourth? Let me see.

Wait, in the intact gene, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala). In mutant4, fourth codon is GCT as well. So, perhaps the only change in mutant4 is the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). So, that's a change from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense, but not a nonsense. So, the protein would be made but perhaps with a different structure.

So, the best bet is mutant2, which introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a non-functional protein. So the anti-nutritional compound won't be made.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A to D. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

So, the correct answer would be option A, Mutant 2.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and non-functional protein.

### Analysis of Each Mutant

1. **Intact Gene**:  
   The sequence starts with `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...`, corresponding to the amino acids Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Glu, etc.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   Sequence: `ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...`  
   Changes:  
   - Second codon `TCT` (Ser) instead of `TTT` (Phe).  
   - Third codon `TAC` (Tyr) instead of `CTC` (Leu).  
   This results in two amino acid changes (Phe → Ser, Leu → Tyr) but does not introduce a stop codon. The protein is still likely functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...`  
   Changes:  
   - Second codon `TTC` (Phe) remains unchanged.  
   - Third codon `TAA` is a stop codon.  
   This introduces a premature stop codon after the second amino acid (Met, Phe → Met, Phe, Stop). The protein is truncated and non-functional, effectively eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...`  
   Changes:  
   - Third codon `TAC` (Tyr) instead of `CTC` (Leu).  
   - Fifth codon `GTC` (Val) instead of `ACT` (Thr).  
   These are amino acid changes (Leu → Tyr, Thr → Val) but do not introduce a stop codon. The protein is likely still functional, albeit with altered structure.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...`  
   Changes:  
   - Third codon `TAC` (Tyr) instead of `CTC` (Leu).  
   - Fourth codon `ACT` (Thr) remains unchanged.  
   This is an amino acid change (Leu → Tyr) but does not introduce a stop codon. The protein is likely still functional.

### Conclusion
The only mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is **Mutant 2**, which results in a truncated and non-functional protein. This would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
