Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's a good starting point. The NMR data is given, so I'll need to analyze that to figure out the structure.

Let me look at the NMR data first. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). I'll try to assign these peaks to different parts of the molecule.

The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet, integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, could it be an acidic proton like from a phenol? Phenolic OHs are usually broader and maybe around 5 ppm, but if it's exchanged, maybe it's at a higher ppm. But considering it's a triplet, maybe it's the aldehyde. So perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group.

Looking at the aromatic region, there's a doublet at 6.98 and 6.51, each integrating for 2H. Those might be two sets of equivalent protons on aromatic rings. Wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene, each ring would have two protons as a doublet. So maybe two benzene rings, each para-substituted. The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that could be some kind of vinyl protons, maybe in a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl, like an enol ether or something similar.

Putting this together: the molecule has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings (probably phenyl groups), and an OCH2 group. Let me think about the connectivity. Maybe it's a diaryl compound with an aldehyde and an OCH2 group somewhere.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is 0 here. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees. So that could be two rings (from the two benzene rings, but wait, each benzene is three degrees) and maybe a double bond and a ring or something else. Hmm, maybe the aldehyde is part of a double bond. Let's think about that.

Wait, another approach: looking at the reagents used. The reaction sequence is NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KO
