Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, wait. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But here, there are three solutions. I think I need to figure out all the possible reactions between these acids and the base.

First, let's break down each solution. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when we mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

But wait, how do the molarities and volumes play into this? I think the key here is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions contributed by each solution and see the limiting reagent. The neutralization reaction will depend on which is in excess.

Let me list down each component:

1. HCl: HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+ ion. The volume is 500 mL (0.5 L) and the concentration is 0.2 M. Moles of HCl = Molarity Ã— Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

2. H2SO4: Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. Each mole gives 2 H+ ions. The volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), concentration 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. The volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), concentration 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. So OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, the total H+ ions from the acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. The total OH- is 0.2 mol.

Wait, but OH- is less than H+. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. The reaction between H+ and OH- will go to completion based on the available OH-.

So the neutralization reaction will consume 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH-, producing 0.2 mol of water.

Wait, but how much H+ comes from each acid? We have 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-. So all of the OH- will react, but we'll only use 0.2 mol of H+ from the available 0.28.

So the total H+ consumed is 0.2 mol. Which comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

But wait, which acid contributes how much H+? HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, so it will donate both H+ ions.

So the H+ comes from both. But when OH- is in limited supply, we'll take H+ from both until we reach 0.2 mol.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting factor. Here, OH- is 0.2 mol, H+ is 0.28 mol. So OH- is the limiting; all OH- will react, and excess H+ will remain.

The enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ/mol (or -13.6 kcal/mol) per
