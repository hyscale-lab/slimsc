Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra, and then figuring out its molecular formula from the options given.

First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretches around 1740-1760 cm⁻¹. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group somewhere. Ester groups are usually R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, actually esters are like R-O-CO-R'. So maybe it's attached to the aromatic ring as an ester substituent.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. The breakdown is: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets), and two signals for -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2 groups. Hmm. So let's piece this together.

The aromatic ring is di-substituted, meaning it has two substituents. Since the compound is a six-membered ring, maybe it's benzene with two substituents. If the substituents are ester groups, like two ester groups, that could explain the IR. But wait, the molecular formula options include O2, so two oxygen atoms. Esters have two oxygen atoms each? No, esters have two oxygen in the group (the O in the ester linkage and the O in the R-O part). Wait, the formula for an ester is R-O-CO-R', so each ester contributes two oxygen atoms. But wait, in the molecular formula, the options have O2, so each ester would add two O's, but if there's two ester groups, that would be four O's. But the options only have two O's maximum, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe just one ester group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else. But if the IR shows only an ester peak, maybe the other substituent doesn't have oxygen. Let's think: maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is a methyl group or something else that doesn't have an O.

Wait, but the molecular formula options have O2. So one ester group would contribute two O's, and if the other substituent doesn't have O, that fits. So the molecule has two substituents: one ester and another group like methyl or ethyl.

Wait, but the NMR has two CH3 signals. So perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methyl group. But wait, how would that work? Let's think about the structure.

Alternatively, could the substituents both be ester groups? But that would require more O's, which the formula doesn't have. So probably, only one ester group.

So, the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is something else that doesn't add more oxygen
