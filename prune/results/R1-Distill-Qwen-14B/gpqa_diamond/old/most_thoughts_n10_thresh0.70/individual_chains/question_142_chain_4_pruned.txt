Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, right! That's a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal elements. Let me write it out. So in matrix form, I think it would be:

ρ = [[1/2, 0],
     [0, 1/2]]

Because |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere, same for |1><1|. Adding them gives [ [1,0], [0,1] ] and then multiplying by 1/2 makes each diagonal element 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that qubit states are represented as vectors in a 2D Hilbert space, but when considering the density matrix, perhaps it's in the Bloch sphere representation. Or wait, maybe it's about the vector representation of the density matrix.

I think the density matrix can be represented as a vector in 3D space using the Bloch sphere formalism. For a general single-qubit state, the density matrix is written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector with components (x, y, z). So, the vector r corresponds to the coefficients multiplied by the Pauli matrices.

Let me write that. The general form is ρ = (I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z)/2. So if I compare this to the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is the same as I/2 because |0><0| + |1><1| equals the identity matrix I.

Wait, that's right. Because |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly for |1><1|. Adding them gives the identity matrix.

So, our given ρ is I/2. So setting this equal to (I + r·σ)/2, we have I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ.

Which implies that the vector r is zero. Because when r is zero, the terms xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z are zero, so r·σ is zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up.

Another way: The density matrix can also be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is parameterized by angles θ and φ. For a density matrix in diagonal form, like this one, it's a completely mixed state. Wait, wait, because ρ here is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is a completely mixed state. For a mixed state, the Bloch vector points to the origin because the state is maximally mixed.

Alternatively, the pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and mixed states are inside. A completely mixed state would be at the center, which is the origin (0,0,0). So yes, r is (0,0,0).

So the correct
