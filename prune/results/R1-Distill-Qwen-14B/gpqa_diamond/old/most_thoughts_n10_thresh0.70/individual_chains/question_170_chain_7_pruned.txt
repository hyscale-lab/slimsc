Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in the given spin state (3i, 4). Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

Wait, let me think. The spin state is given as a column vector (3i, 4), so ψ is [3i; 4]. The Pauli matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh right, and S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y, so the expectation value might involve that factor.

Wait, no, wait. No, the expectation value for S_y would be ⟨ψ| (σ_y) |ψ⟩ multiplied by ħ/2. Because spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So, first, I should calculate ψ† σ_y ψ. Let me compute that. So ψ is [3i; 4], ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be [ -3, 4i ].

Wait no, wait. Wait, the first component is 3i, so when taking the conjugate, it becomes -3. The second component is 4, which becomes 4i after conjugation? Wait no, wait. Wait, the
