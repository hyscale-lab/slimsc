Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves enolates adding to alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the reagent is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So dimethyl malonate is a good di-electrophile because it can form an enolate. Under basic conditions like NaOEt, the malonate will deprotonate to form an enolate. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the Michael acceptor here.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a nucleophile) will attack the beta position of the acrylate. The attack occurs on the less substituted carbon because of the E configuration. Wait, no, wait. The E configuration means the groups on either side are opposite. So for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the p-tolyl group and the ester group are on opposite sides.

So when the enolate attacks, it'll add to the beta carbon, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. The acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-C(O)OR. But wait, the substituent is at the 3 position. So the structure is CH2-C(O)OEt connected to a p-tolyl group at the alpha position. Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit confused. Let me sketch it out.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. When deprotonated, it becomes CH2(COOEt)- with a negative charge on the central carbon. The enolate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the beta carbon? Wait no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the alpha carbon, I think. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OEt. Oh wait, no, wait. The numbering might be different. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would be CH2=CH-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C-(p-tolyl)CO-OEt
