Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a nuclear decay converting two heavy nucleons of flavor A into two B, while emitting two lighter particles E and V. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with some endpoint Q.

Now, there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compares to the original decay.

Hmm. I remember that in particle decays, the energy spectrum of emitted particles depends on whether the decay produces a continuous or discrete spectrum. For example, beta decay usually emits electrons with a continuous spectrum because of the conservation of energy and momentum, but if there's an additional particle that carries away some energy, it could change things.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Let's think about this. Each E and V must carry away energy and momentum. But wait, since the E particles have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that their energies can vary, right? So maybe the decay doesn't have enough energy to make each E have a fixed maximum energy, so they have a range.

Wait, but why is the E spectrum continuous? Oh, because in the decay, the particles are emitted in a way that their energies are not fixed. Maybe because the decay involves multiple particles, and each can take any energy as long as the conservation laws are satisfied. So the E's have a continuous distribution up to some maximum energy Q.

In the original scenario, the maximum energy Q would be determined by the available energy in the decay. Considering that energy and momentum must be conserved, the maximum Q is when all other particles take the minimum possible energy. For example, if V's are emitted, perhaps their rest mass affects the maximum E energy.

In the variant decay, instead of two V's, there's one massless M. Massless means M has zero rest mass, so its energy is equal to its momentum times c, but since it's massless, maybe it's like a photon, which always travels at speed c.

So, the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Now, how does this affect the E particles' spectrum?

Wait, the original decay had two particles V. Let's think about the original scenario: if each V has some energy, then in the original decay, the E's must share the available energy with them. Now, in the variant, two E's and one M are emitted. Since M is mass
