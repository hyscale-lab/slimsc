Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Hmm, binary compounds mean they are made of two elements, fluorine and Y. So Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F.

The first part says that substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Wait, oxidation reactions usually involve gaining electrons. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is causing it to oxidize, maybe A1 is acting as a strong oxidizing agent. Oh, but wait, fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent. So perhaps A1 is a fluorine compound.

A2 has an oF (I think that stands for oxidation state of fluorine) of 31.96%. Wait, oxidation states are usually percentages based on the element's valence. So fluorine typically has an oxidation state of -1. But maybe in some compounds, especially when it's part of a more complex structure, that's different. Hmm, but 31.96% is like a third. Oh wait, because fluorine's atomic weight is about 19 (since F is approximately 19 g/mol), so 31.96% of the molecular weight would be 19 times some number. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is likely a simple fluoride of Y, like YF. Or maybe YF3 or something else
