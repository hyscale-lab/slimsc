Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's see what I can figure out.

First, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n + 2 - m - x - p)/2. So for C9H11NO2: n=9, m=11, x=2 (O), p=1 (N). Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So 3 degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, but more likely a combination. Probably a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU by itself) plus maybe a double bond or a carbonyl group.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. Strong band at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests the compound has an amide group or maybe an ester. Because amides have N-H and C=O. Alternatively, if it's an ester, maybe it's an ester carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR also shows N-H stretches. So it's probably an amide because esters don't have N-H groups. Alternatively, maybe an amine with a carbonyl, but the N-H in IR would be from an amide. So the compound likely has an amide group.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to something that splits it into a triplet. The integration is 3H, so probably the methyl end of an ethyl group (OCH2CH3 or something similar).

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet integrating to 2H. Could be an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but wait, that's the same as the 1.20 ppm? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, this might be an NH group, but it's a singlet and broad, which makes me think it's not an NH because in amides, NH protons are usually broad but maybe split into something else. Wait, but if it's an amide, the N-H protons are usually broad, but in the NMR, they might not show up if they're exchanging and broad, but in this case, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Maybe it's an OCH2 group. Like OCH2 attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH2 group, but that
