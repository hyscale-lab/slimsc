Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which product is formed when a specific compound reacts with hydrogen bromide. Let me think through this step by step.

The compound given is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw its structure mentally. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether part is O connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but the butenyl group is four carbons. So numbering starts from the oxygen. The structure would be OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.

The butenyl group is four carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-? No, wait, the substituent is at the first position. So, the structure is
