Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, the question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. Then, the products from both are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks the chemist observes in each case.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll focus on Reaction I: treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by an acidic workup. 

LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO..., so when reduced, it becomes CH2CH2CH(OH)...? Let me think. Structure: the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. So the structure is:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbon chain is six carbons long. The ketone is on C3. The substituents on C5 are methoxy, another group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps more accurately: CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Or wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)3CO where? Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So it's CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Or maybe CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no: hexan-3-one is pentyl groups on either side of the ketone. So structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-
