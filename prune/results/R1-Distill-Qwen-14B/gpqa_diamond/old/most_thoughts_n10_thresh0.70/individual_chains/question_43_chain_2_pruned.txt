Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming question about a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me try to visualize it first. The molecule has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Hmm, meta means they're separated by one carbon, right? So if one is on position 1, the others are on 3 and 5? Or wait, maybe it's a different arrangement.

Wait, the question says all meta to one another. So each substituent is meta to the others. That would mean they form a triangular arrangement on the benzene ring. Oh wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so how does that work? Let me think. If one substituent is at position 1, another would be at 3, and the third at 5. Those are all meta to each other because each is separated by two positions.

But wait, the substituents are a carboxylic acid (let's call that COOH), a carbaldehyde (CHO), and a cyano group (CN). They're all meta to each other, so each is separated by two carbons.

Then, the question says that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino (NMe2) group. Oh, so the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, positions 2 and 6 would have the OH and NMe2 groups. But the question doesn't specify which is where, just that both are ortho (so positions 2 and 6).

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3). Para is position 4, so the OCH3 is at 4.

Additionally, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile (CN group). So the CN group must be such that its adjacent positions (ortho) are where OCH3 and OH are. So if OCH3 is at 4, and OH is at 2 or 6, then the CN must be at position 5 or 3 or something.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw this out mentally.

Let's assign positions. Let's fix the carboxylic acid at position 1. Then, the substituents meta to it would be at 3 and 5.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are all meta to each other. So COOH, CHO, and CN are each meta to each other. So their positions must be 1, 3, and 5? Because in a benzene ring, positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. So if COOH is at 1, then CHO would be at 3, and CN at 5. Alternatively, any permutation of that.

Then, the substituents ortho to COOH (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. So those are OH and NMe2. So either position 2 is OH and 6 is NMe2, or vice versa.

Also, para to COOH is position 4, which is OCH3.

Moreover, the OCH3 and OH are both ortho to the CN group. Let's think about where CN is. If CN is at position 5, then its ortho positions are 4 and 6. So OCH3 is at 4 (ortho to CN), but OH would need to be at 6 (ortho to CN). So in that case, the substituents at 2 and 6 are OH
