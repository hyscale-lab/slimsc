Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a density matrix which is Gaussian in the phase space, like coherent states or thermal states. Non-Gaussian states, like the cat state, are important for things like quantum computing because they're more complex and can't be described by Gaussian operations alone.

The problem gives me a specific state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. The formula is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of our state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, so the relative entropy between rho and tau is this expression. But wait, relative entropy is usually S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Oh wait, but the problem defines del_b as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Hmm, that's different. So it's not the standard relative entropy between rho and tau. It's the difference between rho's entropy and tau's entropy. Interesting. 

So non-Gaussianity here would be the difference in the von Neumann entropy between the state and a reference Gaussian state. But I'm a bit confused about what the reference Gaussian state tau is here. Because the choice of tau could affect the measure. Oh well, maybe for this problem, tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in some sense, like the one with the same first and second moments. But without more info, I might have to assume that tau is a specific Gaussian state, perhaps the maximum entropy one, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy between rho and tau, but perhaps the formula is given as del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Because in the problem statement, it's written as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau).

Wait, but wait, von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = trace(rho ln rho). So if tau is another state, then S(rho) - S(tau) would be the difference in their entropies. So the non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of our state and the entropy of a reference Gaussian state. But I'm not exactly sure how to compute that without knowing tau.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first moments and the same covariance matrix as rho. Because that's a way to define the 'closest' Gaussian state. But for a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the expectation values might be similar to a different Gaussian state.

Alternatively, maybe tau is the completely mixed Gaussian state. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state, which would be the thermal state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the state. The state |psi> given is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). When phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) would be cos(-pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha> ) / N, where N is the normalization.

Wait, but for phi = -pi/4, sin(2phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1) exp(-2 alpha²)). Plugging alpha = 0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) which is about 0.6065. So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. To compute rho, I would have to compute this outer product. But that's going to be a bit involved. But perhaps instead of computing the full density matrix, I can find some properties of rho that are needed for the entropy.

Wait, but the problem is to compute the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. But to compute the entropy, I need to know the eigenvalues of rho and tau.

Wait, but rho is a pure state because |psi> is a pure state. So rho is a pure state, and its von Neumann entropy is zero. Because for a pure state, S(rho)=0. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. For a pure state, rho has rank 1, so the eigenvalues are 1 and 0s. So the entropy is -lambda ln lambda summed over all eigenvalues. So for a single eigenvalue 1, entropy is 0.

Wait, but wait, the given state is a superposition, but is it necessarily pure? Yes, because |psi> is a normalized state. So rho is a pure state, so S(rho)=0.

Hmm, that can't be right because the problem is asking for non-Gaussianity, which must be non-zero. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the non-Gaussianity measure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The problem defines non-Gaussianity as the difference between rho's entropy and tau's entropy. So if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, and tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a maximally mixed Gaussian state? Like a completely mixed state? Or perhaps a coherent state?

Wait, but tau is a Gaussian state. So suppose tau is a thermal state, which is a Gaussian state with maximum entropy. But wait, the maximum entropy Gaussian state for a single mode is the thermal state with the highest possible entropy for a given average photon number. Alternatively, perhaps the vacuum state, which is a Gaussian state, but not necessarily the maximum entropy one.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the state that has the same first moments and the same covariance matrix as rho. But since rho is a pure state, the covariance matrix would be different from that of a Gaussian state, so tau would have to be the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, maybe the non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state tau, which minimizes S(rho || tau). But in this problem, the
