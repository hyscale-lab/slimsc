Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity and I'm a bit shaky on it, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about arranging five nucleophiles in order of their reactivity from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution. The options given are A, B, C, D, each listing a different order.

First, I need to remember what factors influence the reactivity of nucleophiles. From what I recall, nucleophilicity is influenced by the solvent. In polar aprotic solvents, the order is based on basicity because they aren't stabilized as much by solvation. But in polar protic solvents, like water, the solvation effect plays a bigger role. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in aprotic solvents, but in protic solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated nucleophiles are better.

Looking at the nucleophiles given:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's a cyclohexoxide ion. It's a conjugate base of an alcohol, so it's a strong base. But in aqueous solution, it's highly solvated. Wait, wait. Or is it? Wait, cyclohexoxide is a big, bulky base. Maybe its solubility isn't as high as smaller ions? Hmm.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH-): Also a strong base. In aqueous solution, it's well-solvated. But compared to something like thiolate, which is a stronger base, maybe it's less reactive as a nucleophile in aqueous because it's more stabilized?

Wait, no. Wait, hydroxide is a strong base and a good nucleophile, but in protic solvents like water, the solvation can hinder its nucleophilicity. But compared to other ions, like thiolate, which is a weaker base but maybe better nucleophile in some cases.

Wait, wait. Let me think about nucleophilicity trends. In polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is usually I- > Br- > Cl- > F-, but that's for halides. For other nucleophiles, like amines, alcohols, thiols, etc.:

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity tends to follow their basicity but with some exceptions because of solvation. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in aprotic solvents, but in protic solvents, the more polarizable and less stabilized (less solvated) nucleophiles are better. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the general trend is that in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity correlates with basicity. But in polar protic solvents, the most basic (and thus, more polarizable) nucleophiles are the best. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the nucleophile's ability to be solvated. So, larger, less charged species are better nucleophiles because they are less stabilized by solvation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. In polar protic solvents, the nucleophiles are surrounded by solvent molecules (solvated), which slows them down. So, the more stabilized (more solvated) a nucleophile is, the less reactive it is. So, weaker bases are better nucleophiles in polar protic solvents because they are less likely to be solvated. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no, wait. Stronger bases are more available to attack as nucleophiles in aprotic solvents because they aren't as solvated. But in protic solvents, the solvation reduces the nucleophilicity. So, in protic solvents like water, the order of nucleophilicity is different from aprotic. For example, in a protic solvent, iodide is a better nucleophile than bromide, etc., because it's not as tightly held by solvation as smaller, more charged ions.

But for oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles, like OH- and SH- (thiols), which are stronger bases, but in a protic solvent, their nucleophilicity might be lower if they are highly solvated. Wait, but thiols are weaker bases than alcohols but better nucleophiles in some cases because they are less solvated.

Wait, no. Wait, thiols (RS-) are weaker bases than RO- because the S is larger, so the lone pair is less tightly held, making it a weaker base. But because S is larger and more polarizable, thiols are better nucleophiles in polar protic solvents. So, even though RS- is a weaker base, it's a better nucleophile in a protic solvent because it's less solvated. So, in aqueous solution, ethanethiolate (SH-) is a better nucleophile than hydroxide (OH-), even though OH- is a stronger base.

Wait, that makes sense. So, in the given options, nucleophile 5 is ethanethiolate (SH-), which is weaker base but better nucleophile in aqueous. So, in the reactivity order, 5 should be more reactive than 2 (OH-).

Now, looking at the other nucleophiles:

3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-): That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a carboxylate ion. Carboxylate ions are resonance stabilized, so they're weaker bases than alcohols or thiols. Therefore, their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be lower. But wait, resonance can delocalize the charge, making them less basic and less nucleophilic.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): That's not a deprotonated nucleophile. Methanol is a neutral molecule. Its nucleophilicity would be much lower than the deprotonated species. In protic solvents, it's a poor nucleophile because it's not charged. So, among the given options, methanol is probably the least reactive as a nucleophile.

Now, the first one: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate. That's a cyclohexoxide ion. It's a strong base because it's an alkoxide. But wait, in aqueous solution, it's highly solvated. The question is whether it's more or less reactive than hydroxide. Wait, cyclohexoxide is a bulky base. But in terms of nucleophilicity, the ability to attack would depend on how well it's solvated. Since it's a larger ion, perhaps it's less solvated than OH-? Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, ion size: OH- is smaller than cyclohexoxide. So, OH- is more highly charged and smaller, so it's more solvated. So, in aqueous solution, cyclohexoxide may be less solvated and thus more nucleophilic than OH-.

Wait, but cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than OH-? No, wait. Wait, cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water. Wait, no: the pKa of cyclohexanol is around 19-20, while water is about 15.7. So, the conjugate base of cyclohexanol (cyclohexoxide) is a stronger base than OH- because its acid is weaker. So, the order of basicity is 1 (cyclohexoxide) > 2 (OH-). 

But in an aqueous solution, which is polar protic, the more basic nucleophiles are more solvated. So, the more basic the ion, the more it is solvated, reducing its nucleophilicity. So, OH- is less basic than cyclohexoxide, but in aqueous solution, OH- is less solvated than cyclohexoxide? Wait, no. Wait, the more basic the species, the more it is stabilized by solvation. For example, F- is a stronger base than I-, but in aqueous solution, I- is a better nucleophile because F- is more tightly solvated.

Wait, so in the case of cyclohexoxide vs OH-, cyclohexoxide is a stronger base. So, in aqueous solution, it would be more stabilized (more solvated) than OH-. But wait, cyclohexoxide is a larger ion, perhaps less solvated? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the solvation is about how well the solvent can surround the ion. OH- is small and highly charged, so it's very solvated. Cyclohexoxide is a larger ion, maybe less so. So, perhaps cyclohexoxide is less solvated than OH-, making it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

But wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me think again. Stronger base = more stabilized by solvation in polar protic solvent. So, if cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than OH-, then it's more solvated. Wait, but cyclohexoxide is a bigger ion. Hmm, which effect dominates?

Wait, the solvation is generally stronger for smaller, more highly charged ions because they can be surrounded more effectively. So, OH- is small and highly charged, so it's very solvated. Cyclohexoxide is a larger ion with a negative charge, but perhaps the charge isn't as concentrated because it's spread over a larger structure. So, maybe cyclohexoxide is less solvated than OH-.

So, in aqueous solution, the less solvated the nucleophile, the more reactive. So, cyclohexoxide (1) would be more reactive than OH- (2), because it's less solvated.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought about basicity. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is determined by the balance between basicity and solvation. Stronger bases are more reactive as nucleophiles if they're less solvated. But if they're more solvated, their reactivity drops.

So, let me list the nucleophiles and their properties:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: Strong base (because cyclohexanol is weak acid, so conjugate base is strong), and it's a large ion. So, maybe less solvated than OH-.

2. Hydroxide ion: Strong base, small, highly solvated.

3. Propionate: Weak base (carboxylate), resonance stabilized, so less basic, less nucleophilic in solution.

4. Methanol: Neutral molecule, poor nucleophile.

5. Ethanethiolate: RS- is a weaker base than RO- (because S is larger, lower electronegativity), but more polarizable, better nucleophile in protic solvents.

So, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity should be: strongest to weakest.

The strongest nucleophiles in aqueous would be those that are less solvated and more available for attack.

So, let's think:

Ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than OH- but better nucleophile because less solvated. So, 5 is better than 2.

Then, 1 is the cyclohexoxide. Is 1 more or less reactive than OH-? Well, if 1 is a stronger base than OH-, but perhaps less solvated (because it's a larger ion), then 1 would be a better nucleophile than OH-.

Wait, but if it's more basic, it's more stabilized by solvation, which would make it less reactive. Hmm, conflicting thoughts.

Alternatively, maybe in aqueous, the order is: 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (cyclohexoxide) > 3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, let me think about each:

5. Ethanethiolate: weak base, but better nucleophile in aqueous because lower solvation. So, very reactive.

2. Hydroxide: strong base, but in aqueous, highly solvated, so less reactive than ethanethiolate.

Wait, but wait, sometimes OH- is a better nucleophile than RS- because of higher charge. Wait, but in protic solvents, the solvation effect is dominant. So, RS- being a weaker base but less solvated would be a better nucleophile.

So, 5 should be more reactive than 2.

Then, what about 1 (cyclohexoxide)? It's a strong base, stronger than OH- because cyclohexanol is weaker acid than water. So, cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than OH-.

In aqueous solution, stronger bases are more solvated, but if the ion is larger, maybe it's less solvated.

Wait, perhaps the solvation is more efficient for smaller ions. So, cyclohexoxide is a bigger ion and less solvated than OH-. So, even though it's a stronger base, it's less solvated, making it a better nucleophile.

So, the order could be: 5 (ethanethiolate) > 1 (cyclohexoxide) > 2 (hydroxide) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but that doesn't fit any of the options. Let me check the options:

Options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at option D: 5,2,1,3,4.

That would be 5 first, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

But according to my previous thought, 1 should be more reactive than 2 because it's less solvated despite being a stronger base. So perhaps the order is 5,1,2,3,4. But looking at the options, none of them have 1 before 2.

Wait, let me think again.

Another approach: in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for different nucleophiles is:

Thiolate (RS-) > alkoxide (RO-) > carboxylate (RCOO-) > alcohols (R-OH), etc.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about specific examples. For example, in SN2 reactions, in aqueous solution, ethanethiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide. So, 5 is more reactive than 2.

Now, what about comparing cyclohexoxide and hydroxide? Which is more reactive as a nucleophile in aqueous solution?

Cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than hydroxide, but in aqueous solution, the stronger base would be more solvated. So, if cyclohexoxide is more solvated, it's less reactive than hydroxide. Or, if it's less solvated because it's bigger, then more reactive.

Wait, but in reality, cyclohexoxide is a strong base, but in aqueous solution, it's probably not as reactive as ethanethiolate but more than hydroxide?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options.

The options are:

A) 5,2,3,1 and4

That would be 5 (ethanethiolate), then 2 (hydroxide), then 3 (propionate), then 1 (cyclohexoxide), then 4 (methanol). That doesn't make sense because cyclohexoxide is stronger base than hydroxide.

Option B: 2,5,1,4,3.

That starts with hydroxide as the most reactive, which doesn't fit because thiolates are better in aqueous.

Option C: 2,5,3,4,3. Hmm, that looks like a typo, as 3 is repeated.

Option D:5,2,1,3,4.

So, 5 first, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 1 is a stronger base than 2, but in aqueous solution, maybe its lower solvation makes it a better nucleophile than 2. So in that case, 1 would be more reactive than 2, which would change the order.

But in this option, 2 comes before 1. That suggests that the order is 5, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

But wait, if 1 is cyclohexoxide, which is a stronger base than 2 (OH-), but in aqueous solution, maybe it's more solvated. So, if more solvated, less reactive.

Alternatively, maybe in the order, the strength of the base is not the only factor.

Alternatively, maybe the order is based on their basicity in the solvent.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the relative nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

Wait, from what I remember, in aqueous solution (protic solvent), the order of nucleophilicity for oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles is RS- > RO- > RCOO-.

So, ethanethiolate (5) is the best. Then comes the alkoxides (like 1 and 2). Among the alkoxides, which is more reactive? Well, in terms of basicity, 1 is stronger than 2, but in aqueous solution, the more basic may be more solvated.

Wait, OH- is a stronger base than cyclohexoxide? No, wait, cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water. So, its conjugate base is stronger. So, 1 is a stronger base than 2. So, 1 is more basic than 2.

In aqueous solution, the stronger base would be more solvated. So, if 1 is more solvated than 2, then 2 would be a better nucleophile. But wait, cyclohexoxide is a bigger ion. Maybe it's less solvated.

Alternatively, smaller ions are more solvated. So, OH- is smaller, so more solvated, making it less reactive as a nucleophile than 1.

So, the order would have 5 (ethanethiolate) as most reactive, followed by 1, then 2, then 3, then 4.

But looking at the options, none of them have 1 before 2. Option D has 5,2,1,3,4. So, 5 first, then 2, then 1.

But if my conclusion is that 1 is more reactive than 2, then none of the options fit. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps in aqueous solution, OH- is more nucleophilic than cyclohexoxide. How?

Wait, another angle: steric factors. Cyclohexoxide is a bulky nucleophile. Maybe in SN2 reactions, which require a backside attack, bulky nucleophiles are less effective. But the question doesn't specify the reaction type; it's general aqueous reactivity.

Wait, but steric effects aside, in terms of basicity and solvation, perhaps OH- is more reactive than 1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me list each nucleophile's expected reactivity.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: Strong base, but in aqueous, maybe less reactive than OH- because more solvated? Or more reactive because less solvated?

Wait, OH- is a stronger base than cyclohexoxide? No, earlier I said cyclohexoxide is a stronger base. Because cyclohexanol is weaker acid than water, so its conjugate base is stronger.

So, 1 is a stronger base than 2. So, in aqueous solution, 1 is more solvated. So, the solvation would make 1 less reactive as a nucleophile than 2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if 1 is a stronger base, it would be more stabilized (solvated) in aqueous, making it less reactive.

So, in that case, 2 (hydroxide) is less basic than 1 but less solvated than 1? Or more solvated?

Wait, stronger bases are more stabilized (solvated) in polar protic solvents. So, 1 is stronger base than 2, so 1 is more solvated than 2, making 1 a worse nucleophile than 2.

So, the order would be 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (cyclohexoxide) > 3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but that would mean 5 is first, 2 is next, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4. So that matches.

So the arrangement would be 5, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Wait, but why is 1 after 2? Because 1 is stronger base but more solvated, so less reactive. So 2 is more reactive than 1 in aqueous.

So, the order is 5 (ethanethiolate) most reactive, followed by 2 (OH-), then 1 (cyclohexoxide), then 3 (propionate), then 4 (methanol).

So, the correct order is 5,2,1,3,4.

Looking at the options, that's option D.

So, the answer should be D.


To determine the reactivity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider their nucleophilicity, which is influenced by factors such as basicity, solvation effects, and polarizability. In polar protic solvents like water, stronger bases are more solvated, which reduces their nucleophilicity. Additionally, larger, more polarizable ions are less solvated and thus more reactive as nucleophiles. Here's the analysis of each nucleophile:

1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: This is a strong base (conjugate base of a weak acid, cyclohexanol) but is larger and less solvated than hydroxide. However, it is less reactive than ethanethiolate due to its higher basicity and stronger solvation compared to hydroxide.

2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A strong base and highly nucleophilic. In aqueous solution, it is less solvated than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate due to its smaller size, making it more reactive than cyclohexoxide but less reactive than ethanethiolate.

3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A carboxylate ion, which is resonance-stabilized and weakly basic. This makes it a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution, less reactive than both hydroxide and cyclohexoxide.

4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it a very poor nucleophile in aqueous solution, less reactive than all other species listed.

5. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃S⁻)**: A weaker base than hydroxide but more polarizable and less solvated in aqueous solution. This makes it the most reactive nucleophile among the options.

Based on this analysis, the reactivity order from most reactive to least reactive is: **5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol)**. This matches the order provided in option D.

Answer: D
