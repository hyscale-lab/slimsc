Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about stars with dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that when stars have spots, it can change their overall brightness and temperature, which in turn affects the spectral lines we observe.

So the problem says the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does that happen? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when they cover part of the surface, the average temperature goes down.

Next, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes—so (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The equation is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. Let me think. When the temperature is lower, the exponent becomes more negative because T is in the denominator. So for a given transition, the denominator in the exponential matters. If the ratio n1/n2 decreases with lower T, that suggests that n1 is higher and n2 is lower as T drops.

But wait, in the problem, when the star has spots (so lower overall T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So n1/n2 is lower in the cooler case. But according to the Boltzmann factor, if the energy difference (E2 - E1) is positive, then a lower T would make the ratio n1/n2 lower, because the exponential term is smaller. So that's consistent.

So the ratio without spots (T=6000 K) divided by the ratio with spots (T=5500 K) would be the factor we're looking for.

But wait, the problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Does that affect anything? Oh right, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So the transition energy between the two levels is E = hc/(λ).

Let me calculate E for that wavelength. H is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 *
