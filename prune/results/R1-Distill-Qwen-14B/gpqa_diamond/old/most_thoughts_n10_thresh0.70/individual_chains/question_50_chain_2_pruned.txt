Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with a "size estimate" written next to it. The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. We need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Hmm, I remember that Feynman diagrams with loops are related to perturbative expansions. Each loop typically contributes a certain factor to the amplitude. The number of loops is connected to the order in the coupling constants and the overall scaling.

Wait, the "size estimate" is probably an expression that tells us about the dimension or scaling of the diagram. In QFT, loop integrals often come with factors that depend on the spacetime dimension, the number of loops, and the scales involved.

Let me break down the given expression. 

So the factors are:
- alpha^3: Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0) or similar. So in terms of coupling strength, that's one coupling. But here it's cubed. So if each loop brings in a factor of alpha, then three loops might mean alpha^3. But wait, no, because in each loop you might have a certain number of vertices or something else.

Wait, wait, no. Alpha itself is proportional to the square of the coupling (like in QED, alpha ~ e^2/(4pi)). So each vertex in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of e, so alpha is proportional to e^2. So if a diagram has L loops, the number of vertices is proportional to L. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.

In a Feynman diagram, each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constants and some integrals. For example, in QED, a one-loop diagram (like the electron self-energy) has a factor of alpha (which is proportional to e^2), so alpha is like (e^2/(4pi epsilon)).

In terms of the perturbative expansion, each loop generally adds a factor of the coupling. So for example, a tree-level diagram (no loops) has no alpha factors. A one-loop diagram has a factor of alpha, a two-loop
