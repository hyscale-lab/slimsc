Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Okay, the setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. When they collide, they produce new particles that decay quickly. These new particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these decay quickly and reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm, I think I remember that the Lorentz factor relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer compared to their proper lifetime. So, particles with a higher Lorentz factor would have a longer lifetime, allowing them to travel further before decaying.

Wait, the problem says that with a Lorentz factor of ~20, one third reach the detector's inner walls. We need two thirds to reach, so we need to find a higher Lorentz factor because higher gamma means the lifetime is longer, so more particles have time to reach the walls.

Let me think about the relation between the distance the particle travels and the Lorentz factor. The distance a particle travels before decaying would depend on its lifetime. The proper lifetime (tau) of the particle is the lifetime measured in its rest frame. The lab frame sees a dilated lifetime, which is gamma multiplied by tau. So the lifetime in the lab is gamma * tau.

The distance the particle travels is velocity multiplied by time. But since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance D would be approximately c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait. The radius is 30 meters. So the particles need to travel 30 meters to reach the inner walls. So D = 30 m.

But the problem states that when gamma is 20, on average, one third of the particles reach. That implies that the average distance they travel is 30 meters, but only one third do. Hmm, perhaps because their decay is random, the average distance they travel is such that a fraction f reach the wall.

Wait
