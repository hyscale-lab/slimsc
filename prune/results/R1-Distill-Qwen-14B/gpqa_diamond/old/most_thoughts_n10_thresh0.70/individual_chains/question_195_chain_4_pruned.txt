Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has an Earth-sized radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet is bigger, 2.5 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane. We need to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that it will exhibit both transit and occultation events.

Wait, what do I remember about transits and occultations? Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we can't see its light, but since it's reflecting starlight, the total light we receive would decrease as well. But for the occultation to be observable, the planet must be smaller than the star, right? Or maybe not, but the point is that the planet must be in a position where it can be eclipsed by the star.

So, for a planet to both transit and be occulted, its orbital period must allow it to be on the same side of the star (transit) and then on the opposite side (occultation). But how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to the first?

Wait, the first planet has a period of 3 days. The second planet's period is what we're trying to find. Oh, right, they're in the same system, so their orbits are around the same star. The star has a radius 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The first planet's radius is 1 Earth, the second is 2.5 Earth.

Wait, but how does the orbital period relate to the other factors? The transit impact parameter is given as 0.2 for the first planet. Impact parameter is the distance in units of the star's radius from the center of the star when the planet transits. So if the impact parameter is 0.2, that means the planet passes 0.2 star radii away from the star's center during transit.

I remember that for a transit to occur, the planet must pass close enough to the star's center. The maximum impact parameter for transit is when the planet just grazes the star—so the impact parameter can't be larger than (R_planet + R_star)/(a), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, I might be getting the formula wrong.

Wait, Kepler's third law might come into play here. The orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via P² = (4π²/G(M)) a³, but since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, we can approximate it as P² proportional to a³.

But how does that help with the problem? Oh, maybe we need to find when the second planet's orbit is such that it can also transit and be occulted. But wait, the problem states that the second planet must exhibit both events. So, for both events to happen, the orbital period must be such that the planet can both pass in front and behind the star.

Wait, but the maximum period would be when the orbital period is such that the two planets are in a configuration where they can't have their orbital periods too far apart, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum
