Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

First, I need to look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. So maybe it's a benzene ring with some substituents attached? Because the NMR data has peaks around 6.98 and 6.51, which are typical for aromatic protons.

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm, a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be that high, but more likely this is an aldehyde. So that's probably the -CHO group.
- 6.98 ppm, a doublet (d) for 2H. That sounds like para-substituted aromatic protons. Like if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, the protons opposite each other would be a doublet if they are coupled. But wait, benzene is usually split into doublets if there are substituents in para positions. Or maybe it's a substituent that causes coupling.
- 6.51 ppm, another doublet (d) for 2H. Also, this is probably another set of aromatic protons. Maybe the ring has two substituents in para positions? Or perhaps a substituent with adjacent protons causing splitting.
- 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange or maybe coupling with something else. Wait, broad could also indicate an -OH proton, but in 1H NMR, -OHs usually show up broader, but with integration. Alternatively, maybe these are vinyl protons, like in an enal system? Or some kind of conjugated system.
- 3.66 ppm, a doublet (d) for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe next to an oxygen or a nitro group. But wait, the molecular formula has an N, so maybe it's an OCH2 group
