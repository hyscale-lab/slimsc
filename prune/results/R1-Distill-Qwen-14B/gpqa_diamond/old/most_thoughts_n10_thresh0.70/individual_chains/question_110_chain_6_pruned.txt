Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let's see. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning it can see stars up to 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so up to 16 mag. So, a star needs to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. So, that means ESPRESSO can see stars down to 17 mag, right? Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So, for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag <= 17 is observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag <=16. So, a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. So, to be detectable by both, the star's apparent V mag must be <=16 because that's the lower (brighter) limit for HIRES, and since 16 is less than 17, it's within ESPRESSO's limit too.

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Oh wait, wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would be an apparent magnitude less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, the limit is apparent V mag ≤17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16.

So, for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V mag ≤16 because that's the stricter condition. So any star that is dimmer than 16 (i.e., apparent mag >16) would not be observable by HIRES. So, the stars must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Now, let's look at each star's apparent magnitude, considering any extinction (dust) which affects

Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think about the information given.

First, I remember that both instruments have different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17, and HIRES can go up to 16. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude better than both. Wait, no—wait, the question says with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So ESPRESSO can see down to 17, meaning it can't see fainter than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so it can't see beyond 16. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be seen by both because HIRES can't go beyond 16. Because if a star is 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤16 for both.

But wait, I should consider whether each star is observed in the V band, and whether any extinction (dust) affects their apparent magnitudes. Because some stars have E(B-V) given, and that affects their observed magnitude.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V mag is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. d=10, log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5(1) -5=15.5+5-5=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Which is below 16. So both ESPRESSO (which goes to 17) and HIRES (which goes to 16) can detect it. Wait but HIRES can only go up to 16, so 15.5 is okay. So Star1 is detectable by both. Wait, but wait, the apparent magnitude for detection is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, but Star1 is 15.5, which is brighter than 1
