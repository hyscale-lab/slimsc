Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is like 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. Right? So each charge is 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the distance between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P is 2 meters.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Since these are charges in an electrostatic system, I think the energy here refers to the electric potential energy stored in the system.

I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, but divided by something. Oh wait, right, the formula is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. But wait, wait. Because for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So we have to calculate all the pairwise interactions.

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is interacting with this fixed charge. Also, the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P, but what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other?

Hmm, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P. But without knowing their exact arrangement, I might have to assume that the problem is simplifying things. Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the energy due to the interactions with the fixed charge at P. But wait, no, because the other charges are all identical and placed symmetrically, perhaps their mutual interactions can be considered as well.

Wait, the question says it's an isolated system. So all possible interactions contribute to the potential energy. But given that the 13th is fixed, perhaps we can compute the potential energy as the sum of the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th, plus the interactions between each pair of the 12.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Let me think, maybe the problem expects us to only consider the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge. Because if the 12 are on a sphere, their mutual distances would vary, but perhaps the problem is considering a simpler scenario where the 12 are arranged in a way that all mutual distances are the same? Or maybe it's considering only the potential energy due to the fixed charge. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps it's considering the scenario where the system is in the most stable configuration, which would be when the charges are as close as possible. But wait, in this problem, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed at that radius. So any movement isn't allowed beyond that. Thus, their mutual distances would vary, but perhaps the problem is only considering the energy from each of them interacting with the fixed charge. Or perhaps also considering their mutual interactions.

Wait, but including mutual interactions would require calculating the potential energy for all pairs among the 12. That's a lot, but maybe it's manageable. Let me try to break it down.

Let me first calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge. Then, calculate the potential energy between each pair of the 12.

So, the total potential energy U_total = U_between_12_and_13th + U_between_12_pairs.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P (where the 13th charge is). So for each of these 12, the potential energy with the 13th is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, but wait, each charge is 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e. So each interaction has energy U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2). So that's (k * 4e²) / 2 = 2k e².

But since each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, the total for all these is 12 * 2k e² = 24k e².

Wait, but wait: the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 is contributing to the system's potential energy in relation to it. So yes, each of the 12 contributes 2ke², so 12 * 2ke² is the sum.

Now, what about the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves? Each of the 12 charges is identical and at a distance of 2 m from P. But their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. For example, if they're equally spaced on a sphere, the distance between any two would be the same. But wait, 12 points on a sphere can
