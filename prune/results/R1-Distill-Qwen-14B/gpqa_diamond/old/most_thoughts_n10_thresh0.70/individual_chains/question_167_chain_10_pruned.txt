Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because Gaussian states are easier to handle, and non-Gaussian features are often linked to quantum computational advantages.

Wait, the state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh right, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase. The question is asking for non-Gaussianity (nG) when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

The measure they're using is the relative entropy del_b, which is defined as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state, and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state. So, non-Gaussianity here is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of the most similar Gaussian state.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I think I remember that for some states, like cat states, the relative entropy can be tricky. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler approach. Oh wait, Gaussian states have density matrices that are Gaussian distributions in phase space, and cat states are superpositions of coherent states, which are Gaussian. But superpositions can lead to non-classical features like Schrödinger cat states, making them non-Gaussian.

So, the non-Gaussianity here is the relative entropy between the state |psi> and the closest Gaussian state. But wait, when is a state Gaussian? Coherent states are Gaussian, but when you take a superposition of two coherent states, like |alpha> and |-alpha>, you get something that's non-Gaussian. So the state in question is non-Gaussian, but how do I find the reference Gaussian state tau?

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is calculated by comparing the given state to a specific Gaussian state, maybe the closest one. But I'm not sure about the exact method here. Maybe for
