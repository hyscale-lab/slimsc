Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my black hole thermodynamics, but let me think through it.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

Wait, entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, right? Which is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh right, and A is the area of a sphere with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2 G M / c². So A = 4 π R_s².

But wait, how do I find the mass M from the given angular size? Oh, right, the angular size relates to the actual size of the event horizon. The formula θ ≈ (R_s) / (d) would make sense here since θ is in radians. Because, you know, for small angles, the tangent of the angle is approximately equal to the opposite over adjacent. So R_s ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first. Oh right, because the small angle approximation works in radians. So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/(180)).

So let's compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad ≈ (1e-17) * π / 180. Let me calculate that. π is roughly 3.1416, so 3e-17 / 180 is about 1.7e-19 radians.

Wait, but wait: wait, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So 1e-17 degrees is (1e-17) * (π/180) radians. So yes, approximately 1.7e-19 radians.

So R_s ≈ θ_rad * d. But wait, d is given as 10^10 parsecs. Oh, I need to convert parsecs into meters because I'm working with SI units for the entropy formula
