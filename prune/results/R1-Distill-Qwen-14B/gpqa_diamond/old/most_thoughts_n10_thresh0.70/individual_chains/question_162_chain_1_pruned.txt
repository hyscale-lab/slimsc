Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, different metrics describe different spacetime geometries, and the area calculations depend on the metric provided. 

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, wait, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. But pseudosphere... Oh, wait, a pseudosphere is a surface in anti-de Sitter space or something? Or maybe it's a surface with constant negative curvature.

Wait, the term pseudosphere makes me think it's a surface with negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But I'm not sure how that ties into the metric given here. Let me think about the metric structure. So, the line element is given as ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). That looks a bit like a conformal metric, where the metric is a multiple of the flat metric. So the conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

In two dimensions, the area element is usually dA = sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, for a diagonal metric like this, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Since both are multiplied by the same factor, sqrt(g) would be 32/(4
