Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question says an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-component. Oh wait, σ_y is given as a matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Right, that's the Pauli Y matrix.

The spin state is given as (3i, 4). So ψ is a column vector with components [3i; 4]. Oh wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the spin state is usually written as a column vector. So maybe the state is (3i, 4) written as a column. So I should represent that as ψ = [3i; 4].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is (3i, 4), so that's a row vector. But for the expectation value, we need ψ†, which is the conjugate transpose. So ψ is a row vector here, but for the matrix multiplication, I think ψ is a column vector. Let me get that straight.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is written as a column vector. So ψ is [3i; 4
