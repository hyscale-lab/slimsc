Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, which I think means that the solution conditions are such that the EDTA is fully deprotonated. The temperature is 25°C, and the stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the stability constant tells us how strong that complex is. The stability constant K is very large here, which suggests that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the problem is about calculating the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. I'm trying to recall the formula for this. I think the stability constant K is given by the formula K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, since the solution is at a pH where EDTA is in its deprotonated form (I think EDTA has multiple protonated forms, but at a certain pH, it's fully deprotonated to EDTA^4-), so the [EDTA^4-] is just the concentration of free EDTA.

Wait, but in the solution, we have the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of EDTA is the sum of the free EDTA and the EDTA bound to calcium. But since the stability constant K is so large, the amount of free EDTA will be very small compared to the complex. Similarly, the free calcium will be small too.

Wait, but the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ ions as [Ca²+] and the concentration of EDTA^4- as [EDTA^4-]. Because each Ca-EDTA complex
