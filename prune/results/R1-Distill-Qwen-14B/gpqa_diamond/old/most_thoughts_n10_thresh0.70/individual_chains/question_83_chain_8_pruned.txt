Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about diluting acetic acid with water and then titrating it with NaOH. They’re asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and I need to find the correct one.

First, I'll read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ water, so that's diluting it by half. So the total volume becomes 40 mL. Then, titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Hmm. Let's break it down. I think the first thing is to find the concentrations after dilution, then figure out the moles involved for the titration.

So, initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. But wait, volume is in cm³, which is liters? No, wait, 1 cm³ is 1 mL, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So initial moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 mL water, total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which has a concentration of 0.1 M. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will equal moles of acetic acid. Wait, how much volume of NaOH is needed for equivalence? Let's calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol. So, moles NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of equivalence point would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added. Wait, no, 25% of the required NaOH. Let me think. 25% of equivalence is 0.25 × 10 mL = 2.5 mL NaOH added.

So, for each point (25% and equivalence), I need to calculate the pH.

Let me start with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). The solution is a buffer of acetate in sodium acetate. But wait, sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte, so it will dissociate completely.

But wait, when you have a solution of a weak base (acetate) in water, it will hydrolyze. So the solution will be basic, but since we're at equivalence point, the pH should be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate.

So, first, let's calculate the concentration of acetate at equivalence.

The total volume at equivalence is the original acetic acid solution (20 mL) plus the added NaOH (10 mL), so 30 mL total. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (since each mole of acetic acid gives one mole of acetate). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.03 = 0.03333 M.

The Kb for acetate can be found from Ka of acetic acid. Because Kw = Ka × Kb. So Kb = Kw / Ka.

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's a very small Kb. So acetate is a weak base, but with such a low Kb, the solution should be slightly basic, but not very much.

The reaction for acetate is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So we can set up an ICE table.

Initial concentration: 0.03333 M acetate, 0 H+ and OH- from this.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

At equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.03333 - x ≈ 0.03333 (since Kb is very small, x is tiny).

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.03333. Solving for x:

x² = Kb × 0.03333 = (5.405e-10) × 0.03333 ≈ 1.798e-11.

So x ≈ sqrt(1.798e-11) ≈ 1.34e-5. So [OH-] is 1.34e-5 M.

Then, pOH = -log(1.34e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.34) is about 0.127, so log(1.34e-5) is 4.873, so pOH is 4.873. Thus pH = 14 - 4.873 ≈ 9.127. Wait, that's around 9.13. But looking at the options, the equivalence point values are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92. Hmm, none of the options for equivalence are around 9.13. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me double-check. Ka is 1.8
