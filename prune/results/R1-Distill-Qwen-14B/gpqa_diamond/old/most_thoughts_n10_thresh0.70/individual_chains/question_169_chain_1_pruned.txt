Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. I remember that in nuclear reactions, especially decays, the conservation laws are key—like conservation of energy, momentum, and charge. But let's think about what each part means.

The particles E and V are much lighter than A and B. So maybe their masses are negligible compared to the heavy nucleons. Wait, but I should consider their masses if they're emitted. Oh, but the problem says E and V are much lighter, so perhaps their rest mass energy is small compared to the heavy particles.

In the original decay, the outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum up to some endpoint Q. That makes me think of beta decay, where beta particles (like electrons) have a continuous spectrum. But wait, in beta decay, the emitted electron's energy is up to a maximum value because the other products (like the antineutrino) carry away some energy. Oh, right! So in the original decay, the E particles (like beta particles) have a continuous spectrum because they can have varying kinetic energies, up to a maximum Q.

Now, the variant of the decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V particles. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Wait, but M is massless. So M is like a photon, maybe? Or some other massless boson.

Hmm, how does this change the energy spectrum of E? Let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum. In the original decay, since there are two V's, which are probably neutrinos or something else, but in this variant, M replaces them. But M is massless, so perhaps its energy is related to its momentum.

Wait, in the first case, 2V are
