Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, let me read the question carefully again.

So, there's an atomic nucleus with mass M at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments' rest-mass sum is 99% of M. Oh wait, so the initial mass is M, and the sum after fission is 0.99M. That means some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, mass can turn into energy.

The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. So, if the two fragments have masses m1 and m2, then m1 = 2m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Let's see, substituting m1 as 2m2 into the second equation: 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M. So m2 = 0.33M, and m1 = 0.66M. Wait, but wait, is the sum 0.99M? So yeah.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So, first, I think I need to calculate the kinetic energy each fragment gets using both relativistic and non-relativistic methods, then find the difference.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Therefore, their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But relativistically, the energy is given by gamma mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

Let me think step by step.

First, let's calculate the energies. The initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest mass is 0.99M, so the rest energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The initial rest energy was 300 GeV, so the mass defect is 3 GeV. This mass defect converts into kinetic energy. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.

Wait wait, actually, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, each fragment has rest energy, so the sum is 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV. The kinetic energy comes from the remaining 3 GeV. So the total KE of both fragments is 3 GeV.

But wait, the problem says the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So the initial rest mass is M, which has energy 300 GeV. Then the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99M, so their rest energy is 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV. Therefore,
