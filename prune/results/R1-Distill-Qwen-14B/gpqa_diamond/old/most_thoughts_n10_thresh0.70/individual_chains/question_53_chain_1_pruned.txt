Okay, I need to figure out the chemical formula of this compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's probably something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. So, the formula should include an ester group, which is usually -O-CO-O- or something like that. Wait, no, esters are like R-O-CO-R'. So, the formula should have two oxygen atoms, which matches the options given (they all have O2).

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's categorize them.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern affects the number of equivalent protons. If the substituents are para, then there are two sets of equivalent aromatic protonsâ€”maybe two doublets? Or perhaps one triplet and another, but more likely two doublets. Alternatively, if substituents are ortho or meta, but di-substituted benzene can have different splitting patterns. But in any case, two signals here.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in an alkene. So maybe there's an ester group with an adjacent double bond, or perhaps a substituted vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, an ester group usually doesn't have vinyl protons. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an ester and another group with a double bond, or maybe the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group.

Let me think about the substituents. Since it's an ester, the substituent could be an ester group, like -CO-O-R. Or maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, but the problem says di-substituted, so two groups.

Alternatively, one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group. Hmm, but then vinyl protons would come from that substituent.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps one substituent is an ester (like a methoxycarbonyl group) and the other is a vinyl group, like an ethenyl group (-CH2CH2- but with a double bond). Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a group with a double bond, such as a propenyl group.

But wait, the NMR shows two types of vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling with two different sets of neighboring protons. Or maybe it's a trans coupling in a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinyl protons is next to a substituent that causes splitting.

Alternatively, it's possible that the substituent is a vinyl ester. Oh, like an ester where the R group is a vinyl. But that would make the substituent an ester
