Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, so that's why quasars, which emit a lot of UV light, are used here.

The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm. So, redshift determines how much the wavelength is stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The higher the redshift, the more the wavelength is shifted to the red end.

But wait, the thing is, if the absorption is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the UV, but ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So, for the absorption to be observed in the optical range, the wavelength must be redshifted into the optical part of the spectrum.

I think the Lyman alpha wavelength is 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. Right, because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So, if the cloud is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength lambda_obs would be lambda_rest * (1 + z).

Ground-based optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from about 400 nm (violet) up to maybe 700 nm (red). Wait, more accurately, optical is roughly 300-700 nm. But some telescopes can go a bit beyond, but generally, they are limited by the atmosphere's transparency. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, lambda_obs must be less than about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms) but higher than, say, 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

Wait, no, wait. The Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So, when redshifted, the observed wavelength increases. So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms.

We need this to be in the optical range. So, what's the optical range? Hmm, optical is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So, 1216*(1+z) should be less than 7000 Angstroms but greater than 4000? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Because for
