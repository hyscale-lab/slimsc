Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and pH calculations can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of the acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options provided are A to D, each giving a specific pH and volume. 

First, I think I'll need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. So, the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(1 +16) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. 

Wait, the mass given is 0.1 grams. So moles of Fe(OH)3 would be mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate that again: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 9.358e-4 mol. 

Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid, it should neutralize the hydroxide ions. The reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions. 

Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl or HNO3, it will donate one H+ per molecule. So, for each mole of acid, we get one mole of H+. So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. 

So, moles of H+ required = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol. 

The acid solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So, the volume of acid needed (in liters) would be moles divided by concentration. 

Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, so that's close to 28 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. So that's probably the volume part. 

But wait, the question mentions a total volume of 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the solution's volume is fixed at 100 cm³. Does that affect anything? Well, for the acid needed, I think it's about neutralizing the Fe(OH)3, so the total solution volume (after adding acid) is 100 cm³, so perhaps the initial volume of acid plus the Fe(OH)3 solution makes up 100 cm³. But when calculating the required volume of acid, the 100 cm³ is the final volume, so the volume of acid added is just the amount needed to neutralize, regardless of dilution. I think I was right before, so the volume is about 28 cm³, so option C or maybe another option. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close to what I calculated.
