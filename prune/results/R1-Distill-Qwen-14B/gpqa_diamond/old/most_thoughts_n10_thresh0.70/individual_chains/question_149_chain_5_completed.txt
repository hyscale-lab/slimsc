Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's read through it again.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each is about half. They ruled out spin-spin coupling, so it's not something like coupling with another proton.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. Hmm, so mass spec is the same, meaning same molecular weight, but the retention times are different in LC, so it's two different compounds but same mass?

Wait, LC-MS at elevated temperature? Oh, wait, I think in LC-MS, when you run at higher temps, it can cause some compounds to fragment or perhaps change conformations. But the question says the mass spectra are the same, so same molecular ions. So, both peaks are the same mass, but perhaps different structures.

What could cause two peaks in LC-MS with same mass? Maybe they are isomers, but same molecular weight. But why don't they run at same retention time in LC?

So, possible explanations could be diastereomers or maybe enantiomers, if the column is chiral. But the question mentions that the masses are same, and the NMR shows duplicate peaks.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The precursor would have a lower mass, so in MS, it would show a different mass. But the question says both have same mass, so probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have same molecular weight, same mass spec, but would they show two peaks in LC? It depends on the column. If it's a regular column (non-chiral), enantiomers would elute at same time. But if it's a chiral column, they might separate. But the question says the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with same mass. So if the LC is using a chiral column, it's possible. But wait, in the NMR, the same alpha proton is showing two peaks. Enantiomers would have the same NMR because they are mirror images. So in the NMR, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. Unless... the environment is different, but no, in enantiomers, all protons are in same environments, just mirrored. So the NMR would look the same, right? So the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, which shouldn't happen if it's enantiomers. Unless maybe the coupling is due to something else, but the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. Hmm, so maybe not B.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Not sure what that exactly means. Double coupling as in maybe the proton is coupling with more than one other proton? But the question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So this might not be the case.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR signals. In the NMR, each diastereomer would give different peaks. Wait, but the question says the same alpha-proton has two peaks. If it's a diastereomer, then for that proton, its environment is different in each isomer, leading to two separate peaks. Also, in LC-MS, diastereomers would have different retention times, so two peaks. But the mass would be same because the molecular weights are same. So D seems plausible.

Wait, but why would diastereomers have the same mass? Because diastereomers have the same molecular formula, so same molecular weight. So the mass spec would show the same molecular ion. So in the LC-MS, two peaks with same mass but different retention times would be diastereomers.

In NMR, for the same proton, but in different diastereomers, each would have their own shift. So in the crude mixture, each diastereomer contributes, leading to two peaks for the same proton. Wait, but in an NMR spectrum, you can't see the diastereomer's effect as separate peaks, unless the diastereomers are in a racemic mixture and the sample is not pure. Oh, wait, but when you have a mixture of diastereomers, their NMR signals would average or split if the diastereomers have different environments. For example, if you have a diastereomeric mixture, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. But in the case of a diastereomer with a different environment for the alpha proton, each would contribute a peak, so in the NMR, you see two peaks for that proton. Because the diastereomers have different structures, so their alpha protons are in different environments, leading to different chemical shifts. So that fits with the NMR observation.

Wait, but in the NMR, each peak integrates for 0.5H, right? Because together they add to 1H. So it's possible that the mixture is 50:50 of two diastereomers, each contributing one proton. So that makes sense.

So the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because there are two diastereomers, each with their own shift. And the LC-MS shows two peaks (diastereomers) with same mass but different retention times.

So the most likely explanation is a mixture of diastereoisomers, which would be option D.

Wait, but another thought: could it be a case of tautomers? But tautomers would have same molecular weight but different structures. But the question is about a peptide, which is unlikely to have tautomerism. So probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is due to some other factor like conformational changes. But the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, which is more indicative of different environments, like in diastereomers.

So I think the correct answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A: Contaminated with a precursor**  
  A precursor would have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. Since the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, this option is unlikely.

- **Option B: Mixture of enantiomers**  
  Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and would produce identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images of each other. However, the NMR shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton, which is inconsistent with enantiomers. Additionally, LC-MS would not separate enantiomers on a non-chiral column, but the question does not specify the use of a chiral column. Thus, this option is unlikely.

- **Option C: 'Double coupling' during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
  The question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Therefore, this option does not explain the observations.

- **Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers**  
  Diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties. In NMR, they would produce distinct peaks for the same proton if the environments of the protons differ. The observation of two peaks for the same alpha-proton in the NMR spectrum is consistent with this. Additionally, in LC-MS, diastereoisomers would have different retention times but the same mass, matching the observations. This explanation aligns well with the data.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

Answer: D
