Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, I think that's a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene or something like that. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's a different substituent arrangement. Wait, the '2-d' part is confusing. Maybe it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, like two methyl groups on the 2 and another position? No, wait, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes when the substituents are in positions 2 and 4, it's called 2,4-dimethyl.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. So, the molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe the 'd' stands for something else? Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because when I see 2-d, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-b
