Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. So let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. The spin state is given as (3i, 4), and the options are provided. 

Wait, spin states. I remember that the spin of an electron is a two-level system, so the state vectors are two-dimensional. The spin components are usually represented with Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The sigma matrices. So the sigma_y matrix is given as:

0 -i
i  0

But wait, the problem says sigma_y is that matrix. So I think that's correct. The sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure. For an observable represented by an operator O, the expectation value is the conjugate of the state vector multiplied by O multiplied by the state vector. So in equation terms, <O> = ψ† O ψ.

In this case, the operator is S_y. But wait, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, right? Because the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

So the spin state given is (3i, 4). Let me represent this as a column vector. So ψ is:

[3i]
[4 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). So I think that's ψ = [3i, 4]^T. So the first component is 3i, second is 4.

Now, to compute the expectation value. The steps are: take the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiply by S_y, then multiply by ψ. So <S_y> = ψ† * S_y * ψ.

But since S_y is ħ/2 times sigma_y, maybe it's easier to compute it in terms of sigma_y and
