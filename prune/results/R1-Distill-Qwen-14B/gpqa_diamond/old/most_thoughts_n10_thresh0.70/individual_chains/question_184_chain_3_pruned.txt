Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem where I need to find the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The substituents on the benzene ring are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be tricky. Let me think: if the ethoxy is at position 1, then the tert-butyl is position 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are in the order 1,2,3. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the numbering is such that when substituted, they are in adjacent positions? Or maybe it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with those groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of directing groups. Because when you add substituents to benzene, each substituent directs where the next substituent will go based on whether they're activating or deactivating, and whether they're meta or para directors.

Benzene's first substitution will be with a group. Let's think about each substituent's nature. Nitro groups are meta directors and deactiv
