Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think through it step by step.

Wait, first, what's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or is it 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, maybe the "d" stands for something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo or shorthand. Wait, no, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because the formula would be C6H2Br(CH3)2, but wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which would have two methyl groups on the ring.

Wait, but the "d" is confusing me. Oh, maybe the correct IUPAC name is 1-bromobenzene-2,4-dimethyl. Because sometimes people write the substituents as numbers with letters, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, but that's not a clear structure. Alternatively, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the bromine is on carbon 1, and methyl groups
