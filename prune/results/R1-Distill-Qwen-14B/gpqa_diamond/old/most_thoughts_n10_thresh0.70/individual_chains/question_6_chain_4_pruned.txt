Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So, I need to figure out what kind of potential this is and then determine the energy levels.

First, I remember that in two dimensions, potentials can sometimes be solved using polar coordinates. The potential here seems to have two parts: a quadratic term in r and another term that depends on cos²θ. Let me break this down.

The first part, (1/2)k r², looks familiar. That's the potential for a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions because, in one dimension, the harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)k x², and in two dimensions, it would be (1/2)k r², where r is the distance from the origin. So that part suggests that the particle is in a 2D harmonic oscillator.

The second part is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, how does that fit in? Well, cos²θ can be rewritten using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Calculating each term: (3/2) * (1/2) is 3/4, so the second part is (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). Wait, but wait, let me compute that again. Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me rewrite the entire potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

So the second term becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So putting it all together:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² [1 + cos2θ].

Hmm, so that's the same as V(r,θ) = [1/2 + 3/4] k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Wait, [1/2 + 3/4] is 5/4. So:

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, but maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potential as a sum of terms and see if it's separable or can be expressed in terms of angular components.

Wait, another approach: in polar coordinates, the kinetic energy is in terms of r and θ derivatives, and the potential is given here. Maybe I can separate the variables or find if the potential allows for any simplification.

Wait, the energy equation for a particle in a potential is given by the Hamiltonian, which is kinetic plus potential. The Hamiltonian in 2D polar
