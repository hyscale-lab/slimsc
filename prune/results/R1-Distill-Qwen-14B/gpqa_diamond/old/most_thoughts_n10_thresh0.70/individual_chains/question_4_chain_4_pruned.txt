Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, the question is about a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Wait, in our universe, that's not possible because magnets always have both poles. But in this scenario, they can have isolated poles. So how would that affect Maxwell's equations?

I remember Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws in electromagnetism. Let me list them out quickly. 

The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field and relates it to the charge density. The second is about the curl of the electric field and the changing magnetic field (Faraday's law). The third is about the divergence of the magnetic field, stating it's zero, which prevents isolated magnetic charges. The fourth is Ampère's law, which includes the curl of the magnetic field and the current and displacement current.

Wait, so if magnets can have isolated poles, that would imply the existence of magnetic monopoles. Right, because in our world, no such thing exists. So, Maxwell's equations assume that magnetic monopoles don't exist. 

In our universe, the third equation is ∇·B = 0, which enforces that there are no magnetic monopoles. If there were magnetic monopoles, that equation would change. Instead of zero, it would have a term involving the magnetic charge density. So equation three would no longer hold as it is.

But wait, the question says that in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So the third equation would definitely be different. But what about the others?

The fourth equation, Ampère-M
