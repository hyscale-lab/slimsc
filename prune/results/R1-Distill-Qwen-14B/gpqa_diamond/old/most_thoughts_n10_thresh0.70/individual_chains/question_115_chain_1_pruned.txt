Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. I need to find the angle between the directions of these photons.

First, I should probably recall what I know about particle physics and conservation laws. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum are conserved. So I think I need to apply conservation of both energy and momentum here.

The setup is: an electron is moving to the right (from the left) with a Lorentz factor of 4, and a positron is moving to the left (from the right) with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. Let's break this down. Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time and length dilate. So gamma equals total energy divided by the rest mass energy. For an electron, the rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV, right?

So the electron has gamma_e =4. Its total energy is gamma_e * m_e c². Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so its energy is gamma_p * m_e c². But wait, wait a second. Since positron has same mass as electron, m_e is same for both.

So electron's energy is 4 * m_e c², and positron's is 2 * m_e c². But wait, since they're moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. So I need to calculate their momenta and then add them vectorially.

Wait, but let's think about the momenta. The momentum p is gamma * m_e * v. But alternatively, since for a relativistic particle, p = gamma m v. But I can also write it as p = gamma m_e c² * (v/c) / c. Hmm, perhaps a better way is to express momentum in terms of gamma and velocity factors.

Alternatively, I know that E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². So for each particle, I can find their momentum.

Wait, but for an electron with gamma_e =4, E_e =4 m_e c². So E_e² = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2. So (4 m_e c²)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2. Subtracting, (16 m_e² c^4) - (m_e² c^4) = (p_e c)^2. So 15 m_e² c^4 = (p_e c)^2 → p_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c² → p_e = sqrt(15) m_e c.

Similarly for the positron, gamma_p=2. So E_p =2 m_e c². Then E_p² = (p_p c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 → (4 m_e² c^4) = (p_p c)^2 + m_e² c^4 → (p_p c)^2 = 3 m_e² c^4 → p_p = sqrt(3) m_e c.

But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So in terms of momentum, the electron's momentum is positive (say, to the right) and the positron's is negative (to the left). So when they collide, their momenta add as vectors.

Wait, no. Wait, when the electron is moving from left to right, its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum before collision is p_e - p_p (since positron's is
