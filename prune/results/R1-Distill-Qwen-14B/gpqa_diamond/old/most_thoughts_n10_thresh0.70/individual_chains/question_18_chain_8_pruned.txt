Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the notation like [Si/Fe] represents the logarithm of the ratio of the abundance of silicon to iron compared to the Sun. Oh wait, right, it's like [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun). So the subscript 1 and 2 refer to the two stars.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [Si_1 / Si_2] or something like that. Wait, no, the ratio is n_Si1 / n_Si2. Because the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Let me see the given data again. Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. Also, Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0, meaning [Fe/H] is zero. Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the Fe abundance in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's. Because [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe / n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun). So if that's zero, (n_Fe/n_H)_Star1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So (Mg/H)_Star2 = (Mg/H)_Sun.

Wait, but what about [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So that's log(n_Mg/n_Si) in Star_2 minus log(n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) equals 0.3. So [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

I think I need to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2, which is (n_Si1)/(n_Si2).

Let me think about how to get n_Si1 and n_Si2.

Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0,
