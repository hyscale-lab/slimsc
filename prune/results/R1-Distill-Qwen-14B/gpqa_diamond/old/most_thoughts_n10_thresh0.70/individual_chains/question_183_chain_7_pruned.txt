Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a certain reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two. So, the formula for calculating it is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogen atoms.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring. The numbering starts at one of the positions. The 3-en part means there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH- substituent.

Wait, wait. Let me draw this. Cyclohexene (so one double bond) with a substituent at position 2 and another at position 5. Position 2 is formyl, which is a CHO group. Position 5 is a vinyl group, which would be CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with double bonds in the ring and substituents.

Wait, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. The substituents are at positions 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). Also, there's a carboxylic acid group. Wait, wait, in the name, the -3-ene indicates the cyclohexene ring's double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the ring has one double bond.

So, the starting molecule has the cyclohexene ring with double bond (1 DoU), a formyl group (which is a CHO, which has a double bond, so that's another DoU), and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-, which is a double bond, another DoU). Also, the carboxylic acid is COOH, which is a carbonyl group, so that's another DoU.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond (one DoU). The substituents are: at position 2, a formyl group (CHO, which is a carbonyl, so another DoU), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so that's a double bond, another DoU). The carboxylic acid is at position, I guess, 1 or another position. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the numbering.

Wait, the carboxylic acid is cyclohexene carboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is a COOH group attached to the cyclohexene ring. The numbering would have the carboxylic acid as position 1. So, the ring is numbered starting with the COOH as 1. Then, moving around, position 2 is formyl, position 3 is part of the double bond, position 5 is vinyl.

So, the starting molecule has the following double bonds: the cyclohexene (1), the formyl group (2nd double bond), the vinyl group (3rd double bond), and the carboxylic acid's carbonyl (4th double bond). Wait, but wait. The carboxy
