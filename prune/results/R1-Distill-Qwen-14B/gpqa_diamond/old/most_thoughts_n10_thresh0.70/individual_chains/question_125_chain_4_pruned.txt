Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I recognize as the potential for a harmonic oscillator. Oh right, because Hooke's law is F = -kr, and in this case, k must be mω², since V(r) = ½ k r². So this is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I remember that in 3D harmonic oscillators, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so we can treat it as three independent 1D oscillators. The energy in each direction contributes, so the total energy is the sum.

In 1D, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (n = 0,1,2,...). So in 3D, the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, this can be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each energy level corresponds to a certain value of n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Now, the third excited state part. Wait, excited states are counted starting from the ground state. The ground state would be the lowest energy, which is n=0 (n_x=n_y=n_z=0). The first excited state would be n=1, the second n=2, third n=3. So the third excited state is when n=3.

So the energy for the third excited state would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω
