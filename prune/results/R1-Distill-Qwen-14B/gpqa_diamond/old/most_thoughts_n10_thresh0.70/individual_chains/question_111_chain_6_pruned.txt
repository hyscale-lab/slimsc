Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving a reaction. I need to find the major products considering steric hindrance and product stability.

First reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. The product is A.

Second reaction: 1-nitropropane + KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and H2O. The product is B.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible A and B products.

Let me tackle the first reaction first. So, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. I think this is a cyclic ketone. The substituents are ethyl at position 2 and methyl groups at 2 and 6. Wait, no, wait: 2-ethyl, 2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl group, and both positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups? Wait, no. Let me draw the structure.

Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. So position 1 is the carbonyl. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl would mean that position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl. But that can't be right because that's three substituents on the same carbon? Wait, no, wait: 2-ethyl implies a substituent (ethyl) on carbon 2, and 2,6-dimethyl implies methyl groups on carbons 2 and 6. Wait, so position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group. Hmm, but that would give three substituents on carbon 2? No, wait, perhaps I'm misnaming.

Wait, the numbering is such that the ketone is at position 1. So the carbonyl is at C1. Then, the substituents are at C2: ethyl and methyl groups. And at C6: methyl.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1. Then, the substituents are at position 2: an ethyl group and a methyl group, and at position 6: a methyl group.

Wait, but that would mean position 2 has two substituents: ethyl and methyl. So that carbon (C2) has two substituents. So the
