Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is about oxygen acting as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. The statement is incomplete, and I need to fill in the blanks with either 'weaker' or 'stronger' and 'faster' or 'slower'.

Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidizing agent relates to its tendency to gain electrons, which is basically its standard reduction potential. A stronger oxidant has a higher reduction potential. But wait, the question is about how thermodynamically favorable it is and how kinetic factors play in.

Oh wait, the first part is about thermodynamics. So in basic solutions, is oxygen a stronger or weaker oxidant? I think about the half-reaction. In basic conditions, the oxygen reduction would involve OH- ions. The standard reduction potential for O2 in basic solution is higher than in acidic. Wait, no. Let me think. For O2 in acidic solution, the reduction reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, which has a standard E° of about 1.23 V. In basic solution, the same reaction would involve OH- instead of H+. So the reaction becomes O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- with a standard E° of 0.401 V. Wait, wait, that can't be right because 0.401 is lower than 1.23. Oh wait no, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. I think in basic solution, the E° is higher. Because in acidic conditions, H+ is available, but in basic, OH- is. Let me check my notes.

Wait, no. I think the standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic is higher than in basic. Because in acidic, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, E°=1.23 V. In basic, it's O2 + 2H2O +4e- →4 OH-, E°=0.401 V. So that means that in acidic solution, the oxidizing power is higher. So in basic solution, oxygen is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically.

Wait, but the question says in basic solutions, oxygen is a … oxidant. So the first blank is about thermodynamic strength. Since
