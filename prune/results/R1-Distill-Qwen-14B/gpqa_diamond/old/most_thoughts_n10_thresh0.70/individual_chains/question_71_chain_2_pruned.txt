Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh wait, the formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, wait, I think the exact formula might vary depending on the albedo. Oh right, the albedo (which is the reflectivity) affects how much energy the planet absorbs. The formula should account for the reflected light as well.

The question says all five planets have the same albedo, so that part is easier because albedo won't affect the ratio. So I don't have to worry about that. The planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest.

Wait, the period is related to the semi-major axis by Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), assuming the same star. So P² ∝ a³. Since all planets orbit the same star, the proportionality constant is the same for all, so the ratio of their a's can be found from the ratio of their periods.

So let me write down the periods. Planet_1: P1, Planet_2: 2
