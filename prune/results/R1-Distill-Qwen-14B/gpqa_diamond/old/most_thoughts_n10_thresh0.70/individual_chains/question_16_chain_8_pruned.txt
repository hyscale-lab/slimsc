Alright, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I need to figure out how many of the given compounds exhibit it. Okay, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which happens when a compound has chiral centers. Wait, but there's more to it than that. Some compounds might have symmetry that makes them achiral even if they have stereocenters. Or maybe they have other features like plane of symmetry or being meso compounds.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Structure: Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another CH2CH3? Wait, but the double bond is between 1 and 2. So structure is Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, perhaps it's more like Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group (since it's 2-methyl) and another CH2. Hmm, so the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but that's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is Cl-C(R)=C(R')-CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it.

But the key thing is, does it have a chiral center? Well, the molecule is (Z) configuration. So the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged. But with substituents: on C1, Cl and a double bond. On C2, a methyl and a CH2CH3. Wait, but if the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, because but-1-ene would have four
