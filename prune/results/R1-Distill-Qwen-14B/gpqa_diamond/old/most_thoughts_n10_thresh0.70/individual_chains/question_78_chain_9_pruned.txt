Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when a charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about potentials, not the fields themselves. Oh right, potentials are kind of like the potentials that the fields come from.

The problem states that there's a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's this vector d which points from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v.

I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr. So, the charge was there earlier, and now we're looking at the effects at a later time.

Wait, potentials are calculated using the retarded time concept, right? Because the effect at time t can't influence the cause at an earlier time. So the potentials depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time tr. Oh right, the retarded time, which is when the fields were actually generated and have had time to reach the observation point.

So, for the scalar potential V, the standard formula for a static charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But since the charge is moving, I think the scalar potential might have a correction due to the motion. Alternatively, maybe it's the same because the scalar potential is
