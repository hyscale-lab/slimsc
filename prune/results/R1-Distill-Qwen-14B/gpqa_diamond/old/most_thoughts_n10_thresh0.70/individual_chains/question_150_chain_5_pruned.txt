Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So substituting: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring and some double bonds or triple bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm): 
9.72 (t, 1H) – that's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a strong deshielded proton. Maybe an aldehyde proton? Or possibly an aromatic proton with some substitution? Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's an aldehyde.

Then 6.98 (d, 2H) – downfield aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.

6.51 (d, 2H) – another doublet, which might be the ortho protons to a substituent. So if one ring is para-substituted, this could be the next ring or substituents elsewhere.

6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like adjacent to an -OH group or in a conjugated system. 2H as a singlet—could this be part of a conjugated diene or maybe a vinyl group next to an OH?

3.66 (d, 2H) – a doublet at 3.66 ppm. That's likely a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps part of a diethyl ether or something else. Wait, but considering the molecular formula, it's probably part of an acetal or some oxygen-containing group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe the compound is a substituted cinnamaldehyde or something similar. Because I see an aldehyde proton in the NMR, and also some aromatic protons.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 ppm (integrate 1H) is likely an aldehyde. Then the two doublets at around 6.98 and 6.51 ppm could be from two aromatic rings. The 6.27 (2H, broad) could be protons adjacent to an -OH group, like in a dihydroxy group or an enol structure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

Looking at the reagents used in the reaction:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This is typically used for diazotization. So if the compound has an aromatic amine group, this would form a diazonium salt. But wait, the molecular
