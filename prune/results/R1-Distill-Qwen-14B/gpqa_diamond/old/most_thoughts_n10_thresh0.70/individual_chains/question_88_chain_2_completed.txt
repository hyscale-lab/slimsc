Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. 

So, the experiment is about tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they're giving these tagged proteins to mice via oral gavage. I remember that oral gavage is a method where you feed something to a mouse by putting it directly into their stomach. So the rotavirus proteins are going into the digestive system.

The imaging shows two issues: some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is hydrochloric acid, which is pretty strong. So maybe the GFP tags got broken down, but wait, GFP is a fluorescent protein, right? It's usually pretty stable. Oh, but if the proteins are exposed to acid, maybe the structure denatures and the GFP doesn't work anymore. So some of the tags were destroyed, meaning those proteins didn't make it through.

The other problem is that some were entangled in the intestinal mucus. Mucus is sticky and can trap things, so those proteins might have gotten stuck before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like the Peyer's patches, which are in the small intestine. So, the proteins that got through the stomach acid and weren't stuck in mucus must have made their way to these patches.

Then, they isolated the proliferating cell population from the fluorescent Peyer patches. So the Peyer's patches are lit up because some of the GFP-tagged proteins made it there. They took those cells and looked at the variable heavy chain gene sequences. They found high variability. 

Wait, what's high variability in the variable heavy chain mean? I remember that during an immune response, B cells undergo various processes that change their antibody genes. The variable regions are where the diversity comes from, allowing the immune system to target a wide range of pathogens.

The options given are processes related to immune response. Let's think about each option:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process where B cells diversify their antibody genes after the initial VDJ recombination. It happens in the germinal centers during the immune response. It leads to higher affinity antibodies. So this would cause variability in the variable regions.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the immune response, especially in the classical pathway. But complement activation doesn't directly cause variability in the genes; it's more about marking pathogens for destruction.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't change the variable regions. So the variable heavy chain would stay the same, so not high variability.

D) VDJ recombination: This occurs during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's the initial process that creates the diversity of the variable regions by shuffling V, D, and J segments. But once that's done, unless there's hypermutation, the variable regions are set. 

So in the scenario, the cells are proliferating in the Peyer's patches, which are part of the immune system. Peyer's patches are sites where antigens are sampled and immune responses are initiated. In the germinal centers of these patches, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and selection. So the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is likely due to somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but isn't VDJ recombination the initial step that gives the diversity in the first place? So the initial diversity comes from VDJ, but the further diversification comes from somatic hypermutation. So in this case, when they see high variability, it's probably because each B cell has undergone hypermutation, leading to more varied sequences.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some proteins were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer patches were identified, and the proliferating cell population was isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene revealed high variability.

High variability in the variable heavy chain gene is indicative of processes that diversify antibody genes. Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, leading to further diversification of the variable regions of antibodies. It explains the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the immune response but does not directly cause variability in antibody genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions, so it would not result in high variability.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This is the initial process that creates diversity in the variable regions during B cell development but does not explain the additional variability observed in this experiment.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in the germinal centers of Peyer patches during the immune response. This process diversifies the antibody repertoire further after the initial VDJ recombination.

Answer: A
