Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

First, let's think about the molecular formula. Both compounds are C10H14. Wait, each molecule must have a certain number of substituents. Let me see. Benzene has six carbons, so if each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, that would be four methyl groups attached. So each would have the formula C10H14. Alternatively, one could be something else, but the options given are all tetramethyl or diethyl.

Wait, looking at the options, they include 1,4-diethylbenzene as an option. Let me think about that. Diethyl would have two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls add up to C4H10. Benzene is C6H6, so the total for 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C6 + C4 = C10, and H: 6 (benzene) + 10 (diethyl) = 16. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Oh, wait, wait, no, wait. Benzene has three double bonds, so each substituent adds H accordingly. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. If we have two ethyl groups (each C2H5), then each ethyl has 5 H. Two ethyls would be 10 H. So the molecule would be C6H6 + 2(C2H5) = C10H16? But the formula given is C10H14. Hmm, wait, so that's a problem. So maybe 1,4-diethylbenzene isn't matching the formula. Or did I make a mistake?

Wait, the formula for 1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H5-CH2CH2-CH2
