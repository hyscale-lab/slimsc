Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of NMR questions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data after a reaction. Hmm.

The compound X is C11H12O. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Oh right, it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait, no, that's for epoxidizing double bonds in specific conditions. Alternatively, I think it's used in the Prilezhaev oxidation, but wait, maybe more commonly, it's involved in epoxidation reactions. Oh, wait, no, I think 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is used in the epoxidation of alkenes. So the reaction is probably an epoxidation of a double bond in compound X to form an epoxide.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that options A, B, C, D all have "oxirane" in their names, which is another term for epoxide. So the product is an epoxide. But wait, the question is about the starting compound X. So the product is the epoxide formed from X through this reaction.

Wait, no, wait. The reaction is when X is treated with that reagent. So the product would be an epoxide, but the question is asking what X is. Because the product's NMR is given. So we need to work backwards: the product is an epoxide, and we need to find what X was before epoxidation. But wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, no. The product is the epoxide, which is the result of X reacting with the reagent. So X is the alkene which upon epoxidation forms the epoxide. So the product is an epoxide, and X is the alkene.

Wait, but looking at the options, all options are for X
