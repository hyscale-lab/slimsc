Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem has three reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C. Then, match them with the options given. Let's tackle each one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under acidic conditions and heat. The product is A.

Hmm. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw that structure. It's an amine where the nitrogen is attached to two methoxy groups and an ethyl group. Wait, noâ€”1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be H2N-C(OCH3)2. Because ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure is CH2(C(OCH3)2)NH2? Wait, maybe it's more like HN(C(OCH3)2)CH2CH3? No, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. If it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then the amino group is on the first carbon, which has two methoxy groups. So the structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? Or maybe CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Wait, perhaps it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's more like (HOCH2CH2) but no, that's for another structure. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Let me think again. Ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would mean that the methoxy groups are on the same carbon as the amino group, so CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Wait, but wait, the formula is C4H11NO3? Let me check: CH2(OCH3)2NH2 is C4H11NO3. Yes, that makes sense.

So the starting material is (CH2(OCH3)2NH2). Reacting with but-3-en-2-ol. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH2? Hmm, no. Let me think. The structure of but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. Because the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol. Butane is four carbons. Position 2
