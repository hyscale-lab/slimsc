Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. So the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. The planets are in circular orbits.

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the host star of Planet #2 has a shift of 7 miliangstroms. So the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The formula for the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured here. The shift in wavelength gives us the velocity.

The Doppler shift formula is Δλ / λ = v / c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So the shift can be converted to velocity. But wait, in this case, the shifts are given in milliangstroms, so I need to relate that to velocity.

Wait, but both stars have the same mass. So when the RV method is used, the velocity semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh, but wait, the same mass for both stars, but the planets' masses are similar to Neptune, so same mass too?

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * (something with sin i). But since e is zero here (circular orbits), and the inclination i is same for both (since we detected them, probably edge-on, but maybe not, but maybe we can assume sin i is same? Or maybe it's not given, so perhaps the ratio would eliminate sin i.)

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the formula for the velocity
