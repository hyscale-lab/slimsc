Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit form of the state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

Wait, no, wait. Because if the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, then the state vector given is in that basis. So when we have the state in the P_z basis, calculating expectation values and uncertainties for P_z might be straightforward.

Hmm, the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the variance, right? So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). But wait, if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So we can't say for sure that ⟨P_z⟩ is zero or something; we need to compute the expectation values.

Wait, but the basis is given as the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state vector is expressed in terms of |+z⟩, |0_z⟩, and |-z⟩, or whatever the eigenstates of P_z are. Let me think about the matrix representations.

Looking at the operator P_z matrix:

The matrix for P_z is:
[ ħ    0     0 ]
[ 0    0     0 ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the basis vectors are |+z⟩ = [1; 0; 0], |0_z⟩ = [0;1;0], and |-z⟩ = [0;0;1].

The state given is a column vector [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ]. So this is |ψ⟩ in the P_z eigenbasis. Let me write that out:

|ψ⟩ = (-1/2)|+z⟩ + (1/√2)|0_z⟩ + (-1/2)|-z⟩.

Wait, but wait a second. The way the matrix is written, each row and column corresponds to the eigenstates. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component is the amplitude for each eigenstate.

So when the state is written as a column vector in this basis, the components are the coefficients for each eigenstate.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z, I can just take the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, weighted by the square of the amplitudes.

Because in this basis, the expectation of P_z is the sum over |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

So let me compute that. The eigenvalues for P_z are
