Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem in front of me. Hmm, let's think about what it's asking. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off like 1/r² radially. Oh right, and it's only got a radial component in spherical coordinates.

Wait, so first, the vector field has a magnitude f(r) = 1/r², and it's purely radial. That means in spherical coordinates, the vector field would have components only in the r-direction. So, f(r) = (F_r, 0, 0), where F_r is 1/r². 

Now, I remember the Divergence Theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. So, the integral of ∇·f over the volume V is equal to the flux of f through the boundary of V. In this case, the boundary is a sphere of radius R.

But wait, the question says to evaluate the volume integral of divergence. So, perhaps I should compute ∇·f first and then integrate it over the volume. Alternatively, using the Divergence Theorem might be easier because I can find the flux through the sphere and avoid doing the volume integral directly.

Let me think about ∇·f. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r). Because the other components (θ and φ) are zero, their derivatives won't contribute
