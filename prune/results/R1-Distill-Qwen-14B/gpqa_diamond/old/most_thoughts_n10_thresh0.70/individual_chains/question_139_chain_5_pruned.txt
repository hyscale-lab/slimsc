Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about two compounds A and B being treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, which leads to the formation of two different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B are correct based on the options given.

First, I remember that when amines react with nitrous acid (HNO2), especially under acidic conditions, they undergo various reactions. For primary aliphatic amines, the typical reaction is diazotization, which can lead to different products depending on the conditions. Diazonium salts can rearrange or decompose in various ways.

Wait, but waitâ€”another possibility: maybe the starting materials aren't amines. Oh wait, no, because the products are diketones. Oh! I think there's a reaction where amines, particularly those with adjacent groups, can form carbonyl compounds. Like the Beckmann rearrangement? No, that's for oximes. Or maybe it's the Curtius or Lossen rearrangement? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another thought. If the reaction involves treating a secondary amine with nitrous acid and HCl, maybe it's a scenario where the amine is part of a ring. Or perhaps it's a case of the Hofmann degradation. Hofmann degradation is when a primary amine is treated with chloroform and a base, leading to the formation of an amide and then a ketone. But wait, the conditions here are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh, wait, another reaction comes to mind: the formation of a carbonyl group via hydrolysis of a diazonium salt.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are alcohols, and under certain conditions, they form ketones. But how? Oh wait, I think if you have a secondary alcohol, and you treat it with certain reagents, maybe through a process like oxidation. But wait, the reagents here are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Hmm, that doesn't directly ring a bell for oxidation.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about the mechanism of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that usually uses a peracid. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are alcohols that undergo some kind of elimination followed by addition. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the treatment is leading to the
