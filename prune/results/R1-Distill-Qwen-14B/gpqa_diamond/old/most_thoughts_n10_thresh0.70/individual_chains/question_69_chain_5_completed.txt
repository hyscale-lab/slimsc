Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame isn't the same as their proper lifetime because of time dilation. Oh right, the formula for that is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. So first, I need to calculate γ for this particle.

The Lorentz factor γ is E/mc², but wait, since E is given as 27 GeV and the mass is 3.41 GeV, I can compute γ as E/m. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's see, 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do that calculation. 3.41 times 7 is around 23.87, and 3.41 times 8 is 27.28, which is a bit higher than 27. So maybe around 7.9 or 7.97? Let me calculate more accurately. 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41*7.9=3.41*(7 +0.9)=23.87 +3.069=26.939, which is about 26.94, very close to 27. So 7.9 is a good approximation. So γ is approximately 7.9.

Then, the lifetime τ is γ multiplied by τ₀. So τ = 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that. 7 times 8 is 56, 0.9 times 8 is 7.2, so 56 +7.2=63.2. So τ=63.2e-16 s, which is 6.32e-15 seconds.

Wait, but I need to find the minimum resolution. Oh, right, resolution in the context of particle detectors usually refers to the spatial resolution, like how precisely the detector can measure the position where the decay occurred. But in this case, perhaps it's about the minimum distance the particle can travel before decaying, which is related to the mean decay length.

Wait, the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It's given by L = βγcτ₀. Because β is v/c, and γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, so I need to compute β as well. Since for a particle at high energy, β is approximately 1, but let's get more precise. The relation between E, m, and β is given by E = γ mc², and β is v/c. Also, βγ can be found from the relation that βγ = (E² - m²c^4)^(1/2) / (mc²) )? Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, for a relativistic particle, the momentum p is given by p = γmv. Alternatively, another relation comes from E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate β as (p c²)/(E), since E = γ m c² and p = γ m v. So, v = β c. So p = γ m β c. Then, E = γ m c². So β = (p c )/(E) ).

But I don't have p, but I can relate E and p. Let's see, from E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. Let's solve for pc. So pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2). So, for E =27 GeV and m c² =3.41 GeV:

pc = sqrt( (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) GeV. Let me compute that. 27 squared is 729. 3.41 squared is about 11.63. So 729 -11.63 =717.37. The square root of that is around 26.8 GeV. So pc =26.8 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's pc. So p = (26.8 GeV) / c. Now, E is 27 GeV, so β = (pc) / E = (26.8 GeV) / (27 GeV) ≈ 0.99259. So β is approximately 0.9926.

So, to compute the decay length L, which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying, I use L = β γ c τ₀.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. β is 0.9926, γ is 7.9, c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s, and τ₀ is 8e-16 s.

So L = 0.9926 * 7.9 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this step by step. First, multiply 0.9926 by 7.9. That's approximately 7.84 (since 8 *0.9926 is 7.9408, but since it's 7.9*0.9926, which is 7.9 * (1 - 0.0074) )= 7.9 *1 =7.9 minus 7.9 *0.0074= approx 0.058. So 7.9-0.058=7.842. So approximately 7.84).

Next, multiply by 3e8 m/s. 7.84 *3e8 = 23.52e8 m/s.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is L = βγ c τ₀. So perhaps I should multiply all together:

beta * gamma = 0.9926 *7.9 ≈7.84 (as above).

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s) and tau_0 (8e-16 s):

So 7.84 *3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7.

Then multiply by 7.84: 7.84 *2.4e-7 = let's see, 7 *2.4e-7 is 1.68e-6, 0.84 *2.4e-7 is about 2.016e-7. Adding together: 1.68e-6 + 2.016e-7 = (1.68 + 0.2016)e-6 ≈1.8816e-6 m.

Hmm, that's approximately 1.88e-6 meters, or 1.88 micrometers. Wait, but the options don't have exactly that. Let's look at the options. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, B is 2.08e-9 m, etc.

Wait, did I make a miscalculation? Let me double-check the steps.

First, compute gamma: E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27/3.41.

Wait, 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41*7.9=23.87 + (3.41 *0.9) =23.87+3.069=26.939. 26.939 is very close to 27, so gamma is approximately 7.9.

But perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 27 /3.41 exactly. 3.41 ×7 =23.87, 27-23.87=3.13. 3.13 /3.41 ≈0.917. So gamma is about 7.917. Let's take 7.917 as gamma.

Next, beta: from earlier, we found beta ≈0.9926. Let's confirm that. So, using E= γ m c², and beta= v/c, then beta= sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²) ) ). Wait, that's another way to calculate beta.

So, m c² is 3.41 GeV. E is 27 GeV. So (m c² / E )^2 = (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2≈0.01595.

So 1 - that is 0.98405. Square root is sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.9920. Hmm, that's a bit different from the earlier 0.9926. Hmm, which is correct?

Wait, earlier approach using pc/E gave 26.8 GeV, so pc/E is 26.8/27≈0.99259. That's about 0.9926.

But via the beta formula, sqrt(1 - (m²/E²) ) = sqrt( 1 - (3.41/27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 ) = sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.9920.

Wait, these are slightly different. Hmm, I think the correct way is to use beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct formula is:

gamma = E/(m c²), since E = gamma m c².

And beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²) ) ).

So perhaps my earlier calculation using beta = (pc)/(E) is correct, but with pc = sqrt(E² - m² c^4 ), as we did.

Wait, let me recompute beta more accurately.

E =27 GeV, m c² =3.41 GeV.

So, (m c²)^2 = (3.41)^2 = about 11.6281 GeV².

E² = 27^2 =729 GeV².

So, (E² - (m c²)^2 ) =729 -11.6281=717.3719 GeV².

So, sqrt(717.3719) =26.8 GeV. So, pc =26.8 GeV.

Then, beta = (pc)/(E) = 26.8/27 ≈0.99259.

So beta is approximately 0.99259.

So, I'll use beta=0.99259 and gamma=7.917.

Then, decay length L= beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

So,

beta*gamma=0.99259 *7.917 ≈ let's compute that.

7.917 *0.99259 ≈ (7.917 *1) - (7.917 * (1-0.99259)) )

1-0.99259=0.00741.

So, 7.917 *0.00741 ≈ approximately 0.0586.

So, 7.917 - 0.0586 ≈7.8584.

So beta*gamma ≈7.8584.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

So, L=7.8584 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m.

24e-8 m is 2.4e-7 m.

Then, 7.8584 *2.4e-7 m.

7 *2.4e-7=1.68e-6.

0.8584 *2.4e-7 = let's see, 0.8 *2.4e-7=1.92e-7, 0.0584 *2.4e-7= approx 1.39e-8.

So adding 1.92e-7 +1.39e-8 = 2.059e-7.

Total L =1.68e-6 +2.059e-7 = 1.886e-6 m.

So approximately 1.886e-6 meters, which is 1.886 micrometers.

Wait, but the options don't have this exact value. Let's look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, none of these match exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta or gamma. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, why 30%?

Because the question is about observing at least 30% of the decays. So, the decay length must be such that the detector can resolve it. Hmm, wait, maybe I've got the approach wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution required so that the detector can 'see' the decay. The resolution is the spatial resolution, like the minimum distance measurable. So, to observe a decay, the particles (Y+ and Z-) must travel a distance greater than the resolution. Otherwise, the decay points would be too close, and the detector can't distinguish the decay from the moving particle.

Wait, but I'm not exactly clear on that. Alternatively, the minimum resolution might be related to the mean decay length. Oh, wait, the problem is about the detector's ability to resolve the decay. So, if the decay length is longer than the detector's resolution, the decay can be observed. But if the decay length is smaller than the resolution, the decay would be missed.

Wait, but the question is to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the detector's resolution must be such that the probability of the decay occurring within a detectable distance is at least 30%.

Hmm, maybe I need to calculate the decay length L, and the resolution should be such that the probability of decay within that length is 30%. Oh, right! Because if the decay length is longer than the detector's resolution, then the particle has a certain probability of decaying within that distance, which the detector can spot.

Wait, the mean decay length is L_bar = beta gamma c tau_0. So the probability that the particle decays within a distance x is given by the relation: P = 1 - exp(-x/L_bar). So to have P >=30%, which is 0.3, we can set P=0.3.

So,

0.3 = 1 - exp(-x / L_bar )

=> exp(-x/L_bar) = 0.7

=> -x/L_bar = ln(0.7) ≈-0.35667

So,

x = L_bar * 0.35667.

So, the minimum resolution x is approximately 35.67% of the mean decay length.

Wait, so I first compute L_bar, then multiply by 0.35667 to get x.

Earlier, we found L_bar ≈1.886e-6 m. So x =0.35667 *1.886e-6 m.

Calculating that:

0.35667 *1.886 ≈approx 0.35667 *1.886.

Let me compute 0.35 *1.886 =0.6591, 0.00667 *1.886≈0.01254. So total ≈0.6591 +0.01254=0.6716. So x≈0.6716e-6 m, which is 6.716e-7 m, or about 671 nm. Wait, but none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the initial calculation of L_bar.

Wait, earlier I had L_bar as 1.886e-6 m. Let me recheck that.

Let me recompute L_bar more accurately.

beta =26.8 GeV /27 GeV = 0.9925925926.

gamma =27 GeV /3.41 GeV =7.917882789.

So beta*gamma=0.9925925926 *7.917882789.

Let me compute that exactly.

0.9925925926 *7.917882789.

Hmm, 7 *0.99259 =6.94813.

0.917882789 *0.99259 ≈approx 0.914.

So total is approx7.862.

Wait, wait, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let's compute 0.9925925926 *7.917882789.

7.917882789 *0.9925925926.

We can write 7.917882789 * (1 - 0.0074074074) )=7.917882789 - 7.917882789 *0.0074074074.

What's 7.917882789 *0.0074074074?

Approximately 7.91788 *0.007407 = let's compute:

7 *0.007407=0.051849.

0.91788 *0.007407≈approx 0.00680.

So total approx 0.051849 +0.00680= 0.058649.

So, 7.91788 -0.058649≈7.85923.

So beta * gamma ≈7.85923.

Then, L_bar= beta*gamma * c * tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

L_bar=7.85923 * 3e8 *8e-16.

Multiply 3e8 and 8e-16: 3*8=24, 1e8 *1e-16=1e-8. So 24e-8=2.4e-7.

Then, 7.85923 * 2.4e-7 = ?

7 *2.4e-7=1.68e-6.

0.85923 *2.4e-7= approx 2.062e-7.

So, adding 1.68e-6 + 2.062e-7 = 1.8862e-6 m.

So L_bar=1.8862e-6 m.

Now, the required x is 0.3567 * L_bar.

0.3567 *1.8862e-6 ≈ let's compute.

0.35 *1.8862e-6 = 6.5917e-7.

0.0067 *1.8862e-6= 1.259e-8.

Adding them gives 6.5917e-7 + 0.01259e-7 = 6.7176e-7 m, or 0.67176 micrometers.

But the options are all approximately 2.08e-6 m, which is about twice 1.88e-6. Hmm, so I'm getting a value that's not in the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the probability but about the average distance. Maybe the minimum resolution is the mean decay length. Because if the detector's resolution is equal to the mean decay length, then on average, the decays can be observed.

Wait, but the question is to observe at least 30% of the decays. So when the detector's resolution is the mean decay length, then the probability of a decay occurring within that length is 63.2% (since P=1 - exp(-1)≈63.2%). Which is more than 30%, so that would satisfy the condition. But wait, the problem says "at least 30%," so perhaps the detector's resolution needs to be such that the probability is at least 30%.

So, with x being the resolution, the condition is:

P =1 - exp(-x/L_bar) >= 0.3.

Which means x >= L_bar * ln(0.7)/-1 ≈0.3567 * L_bar.

Earlier, L_bar is 1.886e-6 m, so x≈0.672e-6 m.

But none of the options have this. But looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is roughly 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, that's about twice my calculated x. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L_bar.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of L_bar.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for gamma. Let me recalculate gamma more precisely.

Given E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

So, gamma = E/(m c²) =27 /3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87. 27-23.87=3.13. So 3.13/3.41=0.917. So gamma=7.917.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value is needed. Let me compute 27 /3.41 exactly.

3.41 ×7=23.87, which is less than 27. 27 -23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 0.91763.

So gamma is 7.91763.

Then, beta: pc= sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(27² -3.41²) )=sqrt(729 -11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.785 GeV.

So beta = pc /E =26.785 /27 =0.992037.

So beta=0.992037.

So beta * gamma =0.992037 *7.91763.

Let me compute that.

0.992037 *7.91763=?

Well, 7.91763 *1=7.91763.

7.91763 *0.992037 ≈7.91763*(1 -0.007963)=7.91763 - (7.91763 *0.007963).

Compute 7.91763 *0.007963:

Approximately 7 *0.007963=0.055741.

0.91763 *0.007963≈approx 0.007309.

Total ≈0.055741 +0.007309 =0.06305.

So, beta*gamma≈7.91763 -0.06305=7.85458.

Wait, that's more precise. So beta*gamma=7.85458.

Then, L_bar= beta*gamma * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

L_bar=7.85458 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Multiply 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

7.85458 *2.4e-7 = ?

7 *2.4e-7=1.68e-6.

0.85458 *2.4e-7 ≈approx 2.050e-7.

Total L_bar=1.68e-6 +2.05e-7=1.885e-6 m.

So, approximately 1.885e-6 m. Now, x=0.3567 *1.885e-6= let's compute that.

0.3567 *1.885e-6 = approx 0.3567 *1.885 ≈0.672e-6 m.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is not about the decay length, but about the velocity and the time. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum time resolution, but no, the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe" which implies spatial resolution.

Wait, another approach: Maybe it's about the particle's speed and the time available. The proper lifetime is tau_0, and in the lab frame, it's tau = gamma tau_0. The time available would be the time the particle spends in the detector. But I'm not sure how that ties into spatial resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the time resolution, but no, the question says "minimum resolution"—spatial, I think.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply to compute the mean decay length and that is the minimum resolution. Because if the decay length is longer than the resolution, it can be observed. But in that case, with the mean being ~1.88e-6 m, and option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close. Perhaps I need to compute more precisely.

Wait, let me compute L_bar again.

gamma =27 /3.41 =7.91788.

beta=26.785 /27=0.992037.

beta*gamma=7.91788 *0.992037=7.8546.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_bar=7.8546 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

7.8546 *2.4e-7=?

7 *2.4e-7=1.68e-6.

0.8546 *2.4e-7=2.05e-7.

Total=1.68e-6 +2.05e-7=1.885e-6 m.

So L_bar=1.885e-6 m.

The required x is 0.3567 *1.885e-6=6.71e-7 m=0.671e-6 m=671 nm.

But the options are all at 2.08e-6 m, which is about twice this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the minimum resolution as the mean decay length. Because if the detector has a resolution equal to the mean decay length, then on average, the decay would be observed. But the question is about observing at least 30% of the decays. So, maybe the required x is smaller than the mean. Wait, because if I use x= L_bar, then probability P=63%, which is above 30%. So the x can be smaller than L_bar.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution should be the L_bar multiplied by ln(0.7)/-1, which was approximately 0.3567 L_bar.

So, 0.3567 *1.885e-6 m=6.71e-7 m.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay length. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the proper lifetime is given, and the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times that.

So, the lifetime tau = gamma tau_0.

The distance the particle travels before decaying is L= beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is what I computed earlier.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is given as 8e-16 s. So, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, L =beta gamma c tau_0.

Using the numbers:

beta=0.992037, gamma=7.91788.

So beta gamma=7.8546.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, L=7.8546 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

7.8546 *2.4e-7= 1.885e-6 m.

So, L=1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, so that's what I've got.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s, and that the minimum resolution needed is the decay length multiplied by a certain factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the given energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider.

Wait, the problem states that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. But in particle physics, energy can refer to kinetic energy (K) or total energy (E=K + m c²).

If E is the total energy, then E=27 GeV. But if the energy given is kinetic, then the total energy would be E=K + m c²=27 + 3.41=30.41 GeV.

Wait, that would change gamma and beta.

Ah, this is a crucial point. Because if the given energy is the kinetic energy, then E=K + m c²=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. So, I might have made a mistake in assuming E=27 GeV is the total energy.

The question says, "Energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." Hmm, usually, in such contexts, energy refers to the kinetic energy. Because in accelerators, they usually talk about the kinetic energy imparted to the particles.

So, let me redo the calculations assuming that the given energy is the kinetic energy.

So, if E=K + m c²=27 GeV +3.41 GeV=30.41 GeV.

Then, gamma=E/(m c²)=30.41/3.41 ≈8.9.

So, gamma=8.9.

Now, beta can be calculated as sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2) ) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(30.41^2) ).

3.41^2=11.6281.

30.41^2= approx 30^2=900, plus 0.41^2=0.1681, plus 2*30*0.41=24.6.

So, 30.41^2= (30 +0.41)^2=30² + 2*30*0.41 +0.41²=900 +24.6 +0.1681=924.7681.

So, (m c²)^2 /E^2 =11.6281/924.7681≈0.01257.

So, 1-0.01257=0.98743.

sqrt(0.98743)= approx 0.9937.

So, beta≈0.9937.

Now, beta*gamma=0.9937 *8.9= approx 8.842.

Then, L_bar=8.842 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

8.842 *2.4e-7 = let's compute.

8 *2.4e-7=1.92e-6.

0.842 *2.4e-7= approx 2.0208e-7.

So, total L_bar=1.92e-6 +2.0208e-7=2.122e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.12e-6 m, or 2.12 micrometers.

Now, the required x is 0.3567 *2.12e-6= approx 7.56e-7 m=0.756e-6 m.

But still, the options don't have this. The closest option is A)2.08e-6 m.

Wait, but if the energy is given as kinetic, then the decay length increases because gamma is higher. So, in this case, L_bar=2.12e-6 m.

So, the minimum resolution needed is x=0.3567 *2.12e-6=approx 7.56e-7 m. But perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length, which is 2.12e-6 m.

Wait, but the question is to find the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, if the detector's resolution is equal to the mean decay length, then the probability is about 63%, which is more than 30%. So, perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean decay length, which is 2.12e-6 m. But the closest option is 2.08e-6 m—option A.

Wait, perhaps the calculations are to be done more precisely.

Let me recalculate gamma and beta with E=30.41 GeV.

gamma=30.41/3.41.

3.41 *8=27.28. 30.41-27.28=3.13. 3.13/3.41=0.917.

So, gamma=8 +0.917=8.917.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41/30.41)^2 )=sqrt(1 - (0.11216)^2 )=sqrt(1 -0.012577)=sqrt(0.987423)=approx 0.9937.

So, beta=0.9937.

beta*gamma=0.9937 *8.917.

Compute 8 *0.9937=7.9496.

0.917 *0.9937≈approx 0.9123.

So, total beta*gamma=7.9496 +0.9123=8.8619.

Now, L_bar=8.8619 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

8.8619 *2.4e-7 = let's compute.

8 *2.4e-7=1.92e-6.

0.8619 *2.4e-7= approx 0.8619 *2.4e-7=2.070e-7.

So, L_bar=1.92e-6 +2.07e-7=2.127e-6 m.

So, approximately 2.127e-6 m.

Hmm, that's 2.127 micrometers.

The option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exactly the same. Perhaps the precise calculation would get 2.08e-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me compute beta and gamma more precisely.

E=30.41 GeV.

m c²=3.41 GeV.

gamma=30.41/3.41= let's compute precisely.

3.41 ×8=27.28. 30.41-27.28=3.13.

3.13/3.41=0.9176.

So, gamma=8.9176.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41/30.41)^2 ).

3.41/30.41=0.11216.

0.11216^2=0.012577.

1-0.012577=0.987423.

sqrt(0.987423)=0.9937.

So, beta=0.9937.

beta*gamma=0.9937 *8.9176.

Compute 8.9176 *0.9937.

Break it down:

8.9176 *0.9 =8.02584.

8.9176 *0.09=0.802584.

8.9176 *0.0037=approx 0.032995.

Adding:8.02584 +0.802584=8.828424 +0.032995=8.861419.

So, beta*gamma=8.8614.

Now, L_bar=8.8614 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

8.8614 *2.4e-7 =?

8 *2.4e-7=1.92e-6.

0.8614 *2.4e-7= approx 2.067e-7.

Total L_bar=1.92e-6 +2.067e-7=2.1267e-6 m≈2.1267e-6 m.

Hmm, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is a bit less than 2.1267e-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the energy is kinetic.

Wait, the problem states the energy is 27 GeV. It's possible that the energy refers to the total energy, not the kinetic. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct.

But then the result didn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the initial assumption that E=27 GeV is the total energy. Then, the decay length was 1.885e-6 m. So, the minimum resolution x=0.3567 *1.885e-6=0.671e-6 m=6.71e-7 m.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to be the mean decay length. So, with E=27 GeV, L_bar=1.885e-6 m. Which is not in the options.

Wait, what if the energy is 27 GeV, but gamma is computed as E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma=27/3.41=7.917.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )=sqrt(0.98405)=approx 0.9920.

So, beta=0.9920.

Then, beta*gamma=7.917 *0.9920≈7.858.

So, L_bar=7.858 *3e8 *8e-16.

Which is 7.858 *24e-8=7.858 *2.4e-7=1.886e-6 m.

So, the required x is 0.3567 *1.886e-6=6.71e-7 m.

But again, no option matches this.

Wait, perhaps the resolution refers to the proper lifetime and not the decay length. That doesn't make much sense, though.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Decay length L= beta c tau.

Wait, no, the correct formula is L= beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, yes, because tau=gamma tau_0, so L=beta c tau= beta c gamma tau_0.

Yes.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation of beta and gamma again.

Wait, another approach: compute gamma and beta using E and m.

Given E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

So, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.

So, pc = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2 )=sqrt(27² -3.41²)=sqrt(729-11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.785 GeV.

So, p=26.785 GeV/c.

Beta = pc/(E) =26.785/27=0.992037.

Gamma= E/(m c² )=27/3.41=7.91788.

So, beta=0.992037, gamma=7.91788.

Then, L= beta gamma c tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

L=0.992037 *7.91788 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 0.992037 *7.91788=7.8546.

7.8546 *3e8=2.35638e9.

2.35638e9 *8e-16=1.8851e-6 m.

So, L=1.8851e-6 m.

So, the mean decay length is approximately 1.885e-6 m.

Now, the problem is to find the minimum resolution x such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, the probability P=1 - exp(-x/L) >=0.3.

So, x >= L * ln(0.7)/(-1) ≈0.3567 *L.

So, x=0.3567 *1.885e-6=6.71e-7 m.

But the options are all in the micrometer range, but none match this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay length is the proper length, but no, the proper frame is when the particle isn't moving, so the decay length is zero. So, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean decay length multiplied by the natural logarithm term. So, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length, which is 1.885e-6 m. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the velocity. Since beta is approximately 0.992, the velocity v=beta c≈0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

The lifetime in the lab frame is tau=gamma tau_0=7.91788 *8e-16≈6.334e-15 s.

So, the distance the particle travels before decaying is L= v * tau =2.976e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s= approx 1.885e-6 m. Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution as the decay length, which is 1.885e-6 m. But the options don't have that. The closest option is A)2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise values.

Wait, let's compute 27 /3.41 exactly.

3.41 ×7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41=0.9176.

So, gamma=7.9176.

Beta=26.785 /27=0.992037.

beta * gamma=7.9176 *0.992037=7.8546.

So, L=7.8546 *3e8 *8e-16=7.8546 *24e-8=1.885e-6 m.

Now, the exact calculation for x=0.3567 *1.885e-6=0.6717e-6 m.

Which is 0.6717 micrometers.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the question is not about the initial decay but about the detection in the chamber, which might have a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, leading to a larger decay length.

Wait, let me assume that E is the kinetic energy, so E=27 GeV, and the total energy E_total=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

So, gamma=E_total/(m c²)=30.41/3.41=8.917.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41/30.41)^2 )=sqrt(1-0.11216^2)=sqrt(0.987423)=0.9937.

So, L= beta gamma c tau_0=0.9937 *8.917 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 0.9937 *8.917≈8.86.

8.86 *3e8=2.658e9.

2.658e9 *8e-16=2.126e-6 m.

Now, x=0.3567 *2.126e-6=7.56e-7 m=0.756e-6 m.

Still, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the mean decay length, and the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is to be done using the velocity and proper time, but I think I've covered that.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option A is 2.08e-6 m. My calculation when assuming E is kinetic energy gives L=2.126e-6 m, which is close to option A's 2.08e-6 m.

Perhaps a more precise calculation would lead me to 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps if I compute E as the kinetic energy, and gamma is 8.917, beta=0.9937.

Then, beta*gamma=8.917 *0.9937=8.86.

So, L=8.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

8.86 *2.4e-7= 2.1264e-6 m.

So, L=2.1264e-6 m.

If the problem is to find the mean decay length, then the answer would be 2.126e-6 m, which isn't any of the options. But option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the given energy is the kinetic energy, and my calculation of L is correct, but the option is approximated to 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would lead to 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps with more precise calculation of beta and gamma.

Let me compute E=27 GeV as the kinetic energy.

So, E_total=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=30.41 /3.41=8.917.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41/30.41)^2 )=sqrt(1 - (0.11216)^2 )=sqrt(0.987423)=0.993708.

Then, beta*gamma=0.993708 *8.917= let's compute precisely.

0.993708 *8=7.949664.

0.993708 *0.917= approx 0.912304.

So, total=7.949664 +0.912304=8.861968.

So, beta*gamma=8.861968.

Then, L=8.861968 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7.

8.861968 *2.4e-7= (8 *2.4e-7) + (0.861968 *2.4e-7)=1.92e-6 + 2.06872e-7= 1.92e-6 +0.206872e-6= 2.126872e-6 m.

So, 2.126872e-6 m.

Hmm, which is approximately 2.127e-6 m, not 2.08e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m. Perhaps the given numbers lead to a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of sqrt(717.3719) is needed.

Wait, 26.785^2=?

26^2=676, 0.785^2≈0.616, and 2*26*0.785=40.76.

So, 26.785^2=676 +40.76 +0.616=717.376.

Which is very close to 717.3719, so sqrt(717.3719)=26.785 GeV.

So, beta=26.785/30.41=0.8814? Wait, no.

Wait, E_total=30.41 GeV.

So, beta= (p c) / E_total =26.785 GeV /30.41 GeV= approx 0.881.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Earlier I thought beta=0.9937 when E is 30.41 GeV, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, beta is v/c, and v = (pc²)/(E).

Because E=gamma m c², and p=gamma m v.

So, v= (p c² )/(E).

So, beta = v/c = (p c² )/(E c )= (p c )/(E ).

Ah, so beta= (p c )/(E )= (26.785 GeV ) /30.41 GeV=0.8814.

Wait, that's different from earlier calculation. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, earlier when I assumed E=27 GeV as kinetic energy, and E_total=30.41 GeV, I computed beta as sqrt(1 - (3.41/30.41)^2 )=0.9937. But this approach via beta=pc/E gives beta=0.8814. Clearly, conflicting results.

Wait, which one is correct?

Wait, the correct formula for beta is beta = (pc²)/(E c )= (p c )/(E ).

So, beta= (26.785 GeV ) /30.41 GeV=0.8814.

Wait, that's a significant difference. So, where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I confused the formula earlier. Let me rederive it correctly.

We have:

E² = (pc )² c² + (m c² )².

So, (pc )² = E² - (m c² )².

pc = sqrt(E² - (m c² )² ) / c.

Wait, no, units are tricky.

Wait, better to work in natural units where c=1.

In natural units, E=gamma m, p=gamma beta m.

So, beta = p/(gamma m) * c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to avoid confusion by using the correct formula.

The correct formula for beta is:

beta = (p c )/(E ).

So, using E=30.41 GeV, pc=26.785 GeV.

So, beta=26.785 /30.41≈0.8814.

So, beta=0.8814.

Then, gamma= E/(m c² )=30.41/3.41≈8.917.

So, beta*gamma=0.8814 *8.917≈7.865.

So, L= beta gamma c tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, L=7.865 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

7.865 *2.4e-7=1.8876e-6 m.

So, L=1.8876e-6 m.

So, with beta=0.8814, L=1.8876e-6 m.

Hmm, that brings us back to around 1.88e-6 m.

So, perhaps my earlier approach where I assumed E was the kinetic energy was incorrect, and the correct approach is to use E as the total energy.

So, the confusion arises because the problem states the energy as 27 GeV. If that's the total energy, then E=27 GeV. If it's the kinetic energy, E_kin=27 GeV, E_total=30.41 GeV.

But the problem says "Energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." So, perhaps it's the total energy.

In that case, beta=26.785/27=0.992037.

Gamma=27/3.41=7.91788.

Beta*gamma=7.8546.

L=7.8546 *3e8 *8e-16=1.885e-6 m.

So, the decay length is 1.885e-6 m.

The required x is 0.3567 *1.885e-6=6.71e-7 m. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to be the mean decay length, and the correct option is A)2.08e-6 m, possibly due to rounding during their calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mass is given in GeV, but the calculation requires using GeV/c². But since we're working in units where c=1, it doesn't matter.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using the velocity and time to find the distance.

Wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau=gamma tau_0=7.91788 *8e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

The velocity is v=beta c=0.992037 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

So, distance L= v * tau=2.976e8 *6.3343e-15= (2.976 *6.3343) e-7 m.

2.976 *6.3343≈approx 18.856e-7 m=1.8856e-6 m. Which matches the earlier result.

So, back to the same conclusion.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculations keep leading me to 1.88e-6 m, which isn't an option. But option A is 2.08e-6 m. Perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, which would be A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption regarding which energy is used. But I can't figure out another way.

In conclusion, the correct decay length is approximately 1.88e-6 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A)2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and the energy of the particle in the Bubble Chamber is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), with a mass \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))**:  
   The Lorentz factor is calculated as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917.
   \]

2. **Beta (\( \beta \))**:  
   Using the relation \( \beta = \frac{p c}{E} \), where \( p c = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} \):
   \[
   p c = \sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \sqrt{729 - 11.6281} \approx 26.785 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   \[
   \beta = \frac{p c}{E} = \frac{26.785}{27} \approx 0.9926.
   \]

3. **Mean Decay Length (\( L_{\text{mean}} \))**:  
   The mean decay length is given by:
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} = \beta \gamma c \tau_0.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} = 0.9926 \cdot 7.917 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16}.
   \]
   First, calculate \( c \tau_0 = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).  
   Then:
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} = 0.9926 \cdot 7.917 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Minimum Resolution (\( x \))**:  
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the probability of decay within the resolution \( x \) must satisfy:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-x / L_{\text{mean}}} \geq 0.3.
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x \geq L_{\text{mean}} \cdot \ln(0.7) / (-1) \approx 0.3567 \cdot L_{\text{mean}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( L_{\text{mean}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   x \approx 0.3567 \cdot 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \approx 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \))**: This is close to the calculated mean decay length (\( L_{\text{mean}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)) but slightly higher. It may represent an approximation or rounding in the problem's context.
- **Option B (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \))**: This is far too small and inconsistent with the calculated decay length.
- **Option C (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{m} \))**: This is unrealistically large and does not match any physical scale in the problem.
- **Option D (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \))**: This is also far too large and inconsistent with the decay length.

### Conclusion:
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is approximately \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), which aligns most closely with **Option A**. While the exact calculation yields \( 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), the provided options suggest rounding or approximations, making Option A the best choice.

**Answer: A**
