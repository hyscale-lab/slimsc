Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

The problem involves several reactions and identifying the molecular symmetry group of a product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups relate to the shape of molecules, so I think I need to figure out what molecule E is first.

Let me break down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction is A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(s). Since A is solid and B is gas, maybe A is an element that reacts with a diatomic gas to form a compound. The product is a bright red solid. I'm thinking of something like sulfur reacting with oxygen or maybe another transition metal reacting.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is sodium (Na), which is a solid. But gas B reacting with sodium in 8 equivalents... Sodium usually reacts with O2 or Cl2. If B is Cl2, 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na because each Na gives one electron, and Cl2 takes two. Wait, Na is +1, so for each Na, you need one Cl- ion. But wait, sodium chloride is NaCl, which is 1:1. But this reaction is 8 equivalents of B, so maybe for one mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. Hmm, maybe A is a transition metal with a higher valency.

Wait, another thought. If the product C is bright red, maybe it's a compound like mercury(II,II) oxide, which is red. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CuO or another oxide. But mercury oxide is red, I think. Alternatively, lead dioxide is dark brown, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when C is reacted with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is something like a toxic gas. Perhaps D is chlorine (Cl2) or another gas.

Another reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. That makes me think of a metal oxide reacting with water to form a metal hydroxide, but if it's a metal oxide, maybe it's basic, but here it's forming acids, so perhaps it's a non-metal oxide. For example, SO3 reacting with water to form H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid?), but wait, SO3 is acidic. Alternatively, if C is a compound that can form two different acids, maybe it's a higher oxide.

Wait, let's think: if C is a non-metal oxide, like SO3, then reacting with water would form H2SO4 (strong) and H2SO3 (weak). But wait, SO3 reacting with water would just form H2SO4, not two different acids. Hmm, maybe a different oxide.

Alternatively, if C is something like sodium oxide (Na2O), reacting with water would just form NaOH, which is a strong base, but that doesn't fit because it's producing acids. So perhaps C is not a metal oxide but a
