Okay, so I have this science question here about the redshift of objects detected using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range for hydrogen. But wait, when it's absorbed by hydrogen clouds, it's called the Lyman-alpha forest, right? I've heard that this is a common feature in quasar spectra, showing up as absorption lines blueward of the quasar's emission lines.

Now, the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, right, because if the redshift is too high, the absorbed light might shift into a wavelength that's not observable in the optical range from the ground.

So, what determines whether we can see this absorption in optical? Well, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm, placing it in the far-ultraviolet. For ground-based telescopes, the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light, so they can't observe much below about 300 nm or so in the optical range. Wait, optical is roughly from 400 nm (violet) to about 700 nm (red). So, the telescope can't see below, say, 300 nm because of atmospheric absorption. But wait, actually, for ground-based telescopes, the optical window starts around 300 nm or higher. So if the observed wavelength of the Lyman-alpha absorption is longer than the atmospheric cutoff, we can see it.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. So, observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). We want λ_obs to be at least in the optical range that the telescope can detect. Let's say the lower limit is 300 nm because below that, Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So, we need λ_obs >= 300 nm.

Given that the rest wavelength λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So,

λ_obs = 121.6 * (1 + z) >= 300 nm.

Let me solve for z. So,

121.6 * (1 + z) >= 300  
Divide both sides by 121.6:

1 + z >= 300 / 121.6  
300 divided by 121.6 is... Let me calculate. 121.6 * 2 is 243.2, 121.6 * 2.4 is 291.84. Oh wait, 121.6 * 2.47 is about 299. So 300 / 121.6 ≈ 2.469.

So,

1 + z >= 2.469  
z >= 1.469.

So the lower limit on the redshift is about 1.47. Looking at the options, the possible answers are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, so 1.47 is between 1.2 and 1.9. But wait, maybe I should consider the atmospheric cut-off more accurately. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 310 nm, which is in the near UV. So maybe the cutoff is higher. Let's recalculate with 310 nm.

λ_obs >= 310 nm.

So,

310 = 121.6 * (1 + z)  
(1 + z) = 310 / 121.6 ≈ 2.55.  
z ≈ 1.55.

Still, the options don't have 1.55. The closest higher option is D (1.9) and lower is B (1.2). Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe the problem is considering that the observed wavelength must be in the visible spectrum, i.e., above 400 nm, because optical telescopes can't see below 300 nm but for practical purposes, maybe they can detect up to that?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far-UV. If the quasar's light is redshifted enough so that this absorption line shifts into the observed range visible from the ground, which is about 300 nm and above.

Wait, another approach: for the absorption to be in the optical, the observed
