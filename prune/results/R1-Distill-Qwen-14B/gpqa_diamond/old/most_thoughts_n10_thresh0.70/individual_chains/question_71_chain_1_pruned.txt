Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

So the question says there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All right, so the periods are in these ratios. And they used the TTV method to discover them. I don't think TTV matters much here, since the question is about temperatures.

The important thing is that all the planets have the same albedo. Albedo affects how much light they reflect, but since it's the same for all, maybe it cancels out when taking the ratio. So I don't need to worry too much about albedo in my calculations.

The question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So I need to find T4 / T2.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula for equilibrium temperature is usually given as:

T = [(L / (16 * π * σ * D²)) ]^(1/4)

But wait, more accurately, the formula is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2 D) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) / ( (1 - A)^ ) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, maybe a better way is to think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The star emits energy, which spreads out over the planet's area. The planet's equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is often simplified as:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But since all the planets are around the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all of them. Also, albedo A is the same for all planets, so the (1-A) term doesn't affect the ratio. So when taking the ratio of temperatures between two planets, the star and albedo terms will cancel out. That's helpful.

So, the formula for equilibrium temperature reduces to T ∝ (1/D)^(1/2), because the (1-A) terms are same for all. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the exact formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T = [ (L * (1 - A) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4 )

But L is the star's luminosity, which is the same for all planets. A is the same too. So the formula simplifies to T ∝ 1/(D)^(1/2), because D is the distance from the star.

So the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T ∝ 1/√D.

But wait, since the planets are in resonance, their orbital periods are in a ratio. We can find their distances from the star using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P² ∝ D³.

So P
