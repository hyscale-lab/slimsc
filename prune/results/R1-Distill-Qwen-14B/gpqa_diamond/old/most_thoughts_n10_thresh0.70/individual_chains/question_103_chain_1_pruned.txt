Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. There are four options given, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to determine which sequence correctly leads to the desired product.

First, I'll try to sketch the structure of the target molecule. It's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromine and a nitro group. The ethan-1-one part means there's a ketone (C=O) attached to the benzene ring at the 1 position. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the numbering is such that the ketone is at position 1, so the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So, the ketone is attached directly to the benzene ring, and on the same ring, there's a Br at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5 when looking from the ketone position.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (O=C-) at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro group at position 5. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring; substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. The ketone is at position 1, then the Br is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So, 1 is where the ketone is, and the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So we need to go from benzene to the target molecule. Let's think about the steps involved.

The target molecule has a ketone group (from ethan-1-one), a nitro group, and a bromine. So we need to introduce these substituents in the correct positions.

Since the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other, perhaps the synthesis involves some directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, and ketones are also meta directors. Bromine is a substituent that can be introduced via electrophilic substitution.

But, the order of introducing substituents matters because each substituent directs the next substitution.

Let me think about the possible steps. Let's consider the substituents:

1. Nitro group (NO2) is a strong meta director.
2. Ketone (C=O) is a meta director as well, I believe, but maybe it's more deactivating than the nitro group.
3. Bromine is an ortho/para director but is deactivating.

Wait, bromine is actually a deactivating group (due to its electronegativity) and an ortho/para director. So when we add substituents, the order in which they are added will determine where the next group goes.

The target has both nitro and bromine substituents. Let me think about how to get them into the correct positions.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 5 and bromine at position 3 relative to the ketone. So, perhaps the ketone is introduced first, then the nitro and bromine are added in the correct positions.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is introduced first, then the ketone, then the bromine.

Hmm. Let's outline possible reaction sequences.

First, the ketone is a C=O group attached to the benzene. To introduce a ketone, one common method is through Friedel-Crafts acylation. So, using CH3COCl and AlCl3 as a catalyst. That would introduce the ketone group at a certain position.

But wait, benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone (phenyl ketone). So step one could be Friedel-Crafts acylation to introduce the ketone group.

But then, where would the nitro group go? After the ketone is attached, the next substituent would be
