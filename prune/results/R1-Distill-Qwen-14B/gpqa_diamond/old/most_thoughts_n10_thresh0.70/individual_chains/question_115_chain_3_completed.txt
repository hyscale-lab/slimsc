Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron annihilating into two photons. Hmm, I remember that when matter and antimatter particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But let's think through this step by step.

The setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one in the upper-right, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between these two photons.

Wait, Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's speed to the speed of light, right? So gamma equals 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. But how does that affect the problem?

I think I should consider the conservation laws here. Specifically, conservation of energy and momentum. Because in any closed system, these must hold true. Since the electron and positron are annihilating, the energy must be converted into the photons, and the momenta must balance out.

So, let's break it down. The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. The total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

But wait, in relativity, each particle's energy is gamma times m c squared, and momentum is gamma times m v. Since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will have opposite signs.

Let me assign variables. Let's say the electron is moving to the right (from left) with gamma_e =4, and the positron is moving to the left (from right), so gamma_p=2. Let me denote m as the rest mass of the electron (since positron has same mass).

Electron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m c² = 4 m c².
Positron's energy: E_p = gamma_p * m c² = 2 m c².
Total energy before collision: E_total = 4mc² + 2mc² =6 mc².

Momentum of electron: p_e = gamma_e * m v_e. But wait, velocity v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can express v as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Alternatively, using the relation that p = gamma m v = gamma m c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that.

For the electron (gamma_e=4):
p_e = 4m c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) =4m c * sqrt(15/16) =4m c (sqrt(15)/4 )= m c sqrt(15).

Since it's moving to the right, let's say positive direction. So p_e is positive.

For the positron (gamma_p=2), moving to the left, so its momentum is negative.
p_p = 2m c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = 2m c * sqrt(3/4) = 2m c (sqrt(3)/2 )= m c sqrt(3).

But since it's moving left, p_p is negative, so p_p = - m c sqrt(3).

Total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p = m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but what's the direction of the total momentum? Since the electron has a larger gamma (4) and is moving to the right, its momentum is bigger (sqrt(15)≈3.87, sqrt(3)≈1.732, so 3.87-1.732≈2.138. So total momentum is positive, meaning to the right.

After annihilation, they produce two photons. Now, photons have energy E = h f, and momentum p = E / c. But since photons are massless, their momentum is entirely due to their energy and direction. Also, the photons' momenta can be in any direction, but they must add up to the total momentum of the system (conservation of momentum).

But wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2. Let's denote each photon's energy as E. So E1 = E2 = E.

Let me think about the momentum of each photon. Since each photon's energy is E, their momenta are E/(c) each, but their directions matter. Let’s denote the angles of the photons relative to the horizontal axis.

One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is above the horizontal (like +y direction), and the other is below (like -y direction).

Wait a second, if both photons are moving in the right direction but in different vertical directions, then their momenta vectors have components along the x and y axes.

Let me model this. Let’s say the first photon (Photon 1) has an angle θ above the x-axis, and Photon 2 has an angle θ below the x-axis, making their angles symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

But wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right, but doesn't state that the angles are symmetric. Hmm, but their energies are the same. Since their energies are the same, each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c. So the vectors for their momenta would have the same magnitude but different directions.

But since momentum is a vector, the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the total momentum before collision.

So let's model this.

Let’s define the coordinate system: x is horizontal (the direction the particles were moving), y is vertical.

The total momentum before annihilation is in the x-direction: p_total = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

After annihilation, the photons' momenta must add up to p_total in x-direction, and zero in y-direction since initially there's no y-component of momentum.

Wait, because before annihilation, all the momentum is along the x-axis, right? So the total y-component of momentum is zero. Therefore, after annihilation, the total y-components of the photons' momenta must also be zero.

Each photon has a y-component of momentum. Let me denote the first photon's y-component as p1y and the second as p2y. Since the photons have same energy and opposite y-directions (upper-right and lower-right), perhaps their y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, if Photon 1 has an upward y-component (positive), Photon 2 would have a downward y-component (negative). So p1y = -p2y. But since they have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same. So p1y = +p, p2y = -p. Then their sum is zero, which satisfies the y-component of momentum conservation.

Now, the x-components of the photons must add up to the total initial x-momentum.

Each photon has an x-component equal to E/c multiplied by the cosine of their angle with the x-axis.

Let’s denote θ as the angle above the x-axis for Photon 1, and -θ as the angle for Photon 2 (since it's symmetric perhaps). Wait, but wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. It doesn't specify whether the angles are the same. Hmm.

Wait, but their energies are the same, but their angles could be different. Because if they have the same energy but different angles, their momenta have different x-components. But since the sum of their x-components must equal the total initial momentum.

Wait, but if the system's total momentum is in the x-direction, then the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta must equal that.

Let me proceed step by step.

Photon 1:
Energy: E
Momentum magnitude: E/c
Angle: θ above x-axis.
Momentum components:
p1x = (E/c) * cosθ
p1y = (E/c) * sinθ

Photon 2:
Energy: E
Momentum magnitude: E/c
Angle: φ below x-axis. (φ is the angle with respect to the x-axis, say in the fourth quadrant)
Momentum components:
p2x = (E/c) * cosφ
p2y = -(E/c) * sinφ

So, the sum of the y-components must be zero.
p1y + p2y = 0
(E/c) sinθ - (E/c) sinφ = 0 → sinθ = sinφ.

So, sinθ = sinφ → which implies either φ = θ or φ = π - θ. But given that one is upper and the other lower, I think φ = θ.

Wait, no. If θ is the angle above x for photon 1, and φ is the angle below x for photon 2, then their sines have the same magnitude but opposite signs. So sinθ = sinφ → sinθ = -sinφ. But that would require that sinθ = - sinφ → sinθ + sinφ = 0.

Wait, but in the equation from conservation, E/c (sinθ) - E/c (sinφ) = 0 → sinθ = sinφ. So that implies that sinθ = sinφ.

Which would mean that either φ = θ + 2πn, which is not possible as angles in different directions, or φ = π - θ.

Wait, but let's think about this. Suppose photon 1 is at an angle θ above x, and photon 2 is at angle φ below x. So their y-components are sinθ and -sinφ, respectively. For their sum to be zero, sinθ must be equal to sinφ, because (E/c)(sinθ) - (E/c)(sinφ) =0 → sinθ = sinφ.

So, the only way this can happen is if either:

1. φ = θ (so both photons have same angle but opposite directions), but that can't be because their y-components would be same in magnitude but opposite, leading to the sum being zero. So this is possible.

2. Or, φ = π - θ. But that would mean photon 2 is at an angle of π - θ below x. Wait, that seems confusing.

Wait, perhaps if photon 1 is at θ above x, and photon 2 is at θ below x, then their y-components would be sinθ and -sinθ, summing to zero. So that's possible.

So in that case, φ = θ. So their angles are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So each photon makes an angle θ above and below the x-axis, respectively.

So now, the x-components would be:

Photon 1: (E/c) cosθ
Photon 2: (E/c) cosθ

So the total x-momentum from photons is (E/c) [cosθ + cosθ ] = 2 (E/c) cosθ.

But this should equal the initial total momentum, which is m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but what about the energy? The total energy after annihilation should be equal to the initial total energy.

Initial energy: 6 m c² (as computed earlier).

After annihilation, the total energy of the photons is 2E (each photon has energy E).

So 2E should equal 6 m c² → E = 3 m c².

So each photon has energy E =3 m c². So their momentum is E/c =3 m c² /c =3 m c.

Wait, but for photon 1, the momentum is (E/c) in the direction θ, so each photon's momentum is 3 m c in magnitude.

Wait, but the total x-momentum from both photons is 2 * (3 m c) * cosθ. Because each photon contributes 3 m c * cosθ in the x-direction.

So 2*(3 m c cosθ) = total x-momentum of initial system.

What's the initial total x-momentum?

Earlier, I found it was m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So putting it together:

2*(3 m c cosθ) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

6 m c cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute the right side numerically:

sqrt(15) ≈3.87298
sqrt(3)≈1.73205
So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈3.87298 -1.73205 ≈2.14093.

So 6 cosθ ≈2.14093 → cosθ ≈2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

Taking arccos of that: θ ≈acos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees. Hmm, let me compute that accurately.

Wait, 0.35682 is cosine of around 69 degrees?

Wait, cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70. Let me calculate it more precisely.

Using a calculator (but since I don't have one, perhaps approximate):

Alternatively, perhaps 69 degrees is close. Let's say θ is approximately 69 degrees.

So each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.

Now, the question is asking for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +69 degrees and the other at -69 degrees, the angle between them is 69 +69 =138 degrees.

Wait, yes! Because the angle between the two photons would be the sum of their angles above and below the x-axis. So 69 +69 =138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So the answer should be C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation of an electron and a positron into two photons using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies and symmetric directions above and below the horizontal axis.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m c^2 + \gamma_p m c^2 = 4 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 = 6 m c^2.
\]
After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of the two photons, each with energy \(E\). Thus:
\[
2E = 6 m c^2 \implies E = 3 m c^2.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relativistic momentum formula \(p = \gamma m v\), and noting that \(v = c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2}\), the momenta are:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_e^2} = 4 m c \sqrt{1 - 1/16} = m c \sqrt{15},
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_p^2} = 2 m c \sqrt{1 - 1/4} = m c \sqrt{3}.
\]
Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m c \sqrt{15} - m c \sqrt{3} = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

After annihilation, the photons must carry this total momentum. Each photon has energy \(E = 3 m c^2\) and momentum magnitude \(p = E/c = 3 m c\). Let the angles of the photons above and below the horizontal axis be \(\theta\). The x-components of the photons' momenta are:
\[
p_{1x} = p \cos\theta, \quad p_{2x} = p \cos\theta.
\]
The total x-momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 2 p \cos\theta.
\]
Equating to the initial total momentum:
\[
2 p \cos\theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Substituting \(p = 3 m c\):
\[
2 (3 m c) \cos\theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
\]
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Numerically:
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.141.
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.357.
\]
Taking the arccosine:
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.357) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Angle Between the Photons
The photons are symmetrically directed above and below the horizontal axis at angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\). The angle between them is:
\[
\theta_{\text{between}} = \theta - (-\theta) = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
