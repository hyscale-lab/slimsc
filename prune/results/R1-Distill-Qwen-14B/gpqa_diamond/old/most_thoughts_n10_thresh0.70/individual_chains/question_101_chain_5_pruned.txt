Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagent and catalyst for the reaction. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction using 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the right reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that reactions involving amines can undergo various types of reactions, like alkylation, acylation, or maybe even some kind of addition or ring expansion. Since the catalyst mentioned is an acid (like TsOH or acetic acid), it's probably a type of acid-catalyzed reaction.

Looking at the product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The cyclohexylidenemethyl group is like a cyclohexene attached via a methylene bridge. So it's a cyclohexenylmethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine ring. Wait, how does that structure form? Maybe through some kind of cycloaddition or ring-forming process.

In acid-catalyzed reactions with amines, I'm thinking of the possibility of the Robinson annulation or maybe an aldol reaction, but those usually involve ketones or aldehydes. Oh wait, another possibility is the formation of a ring via nucleophilic attack. Since pyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation or a conjugate addition.

Wait, another thought: if the amine is reacting with a carbonyl compound. Because the product has a cyclohexene ring attached, which might come from some kind of cyclohexenone or cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a Wittig reaction? Because the Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting aldehydes or ketones with ylides.

Wait, but the product has a cyclohexene ring attached to the pyrrolidine. So maybe the amine is reacting with a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me think: if 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde in an acid-catalyzed reaction, what happens?

Another possibility is the
