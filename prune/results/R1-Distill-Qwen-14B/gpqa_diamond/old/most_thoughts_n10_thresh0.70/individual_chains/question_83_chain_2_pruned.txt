Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, so I think I'll need to think about moles and maybe buffer solutions here.

First, let me read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and the equivalence point. The options are given, so I can check which one matches my calculations.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, right? So when we titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, it will form acetate ions. At various points during the titration, the solution can be a buffer, which is a mixture of the weak acid and its conjugate base. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation will probably come into play here.

Let me start by calculating the initial moles of acetic acid. The volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.0200 liters. The concentration is 0.05 M, so moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Since we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the concentration after dilution would be initial moles divided by total volume. Let me compute that: 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, is that right? Wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol in 1 liter. 20 mL is 0.02 L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, when diluted to 40 mL, 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, during the titration, we're adding NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. Let's think about the 25% titration point. 25% of what? I think it refers to the amount of acid neutralized. So, for 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH.

So, first, how many moles of acetic acid do we have initially? As calculated, 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (which provides OH-) to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water.

So, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, for every mole of NaOH added, a mole of CH3COOH is neutralized, and a mole of CH3COO^- is produced.

At 25% titration, moles of CH3COOH neutralized = 0.00025 mol. So, the remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- produced would be 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but how
