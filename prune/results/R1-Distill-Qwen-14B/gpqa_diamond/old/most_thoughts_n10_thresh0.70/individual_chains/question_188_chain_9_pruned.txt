Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember from my solid state physics class that interplanar distances are calculated using some kind of formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which I think means all the edges are the same length, a, and all the angles are equal. Oh right, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So a is 10 Angstroms, I guess.

The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) in a rhombohedral system is something like d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos(alpha)^2/(1 - cos^2(alpha))) ) ). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I recall that for a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because all the angles are the same.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d = (a^2 (hkl)) / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )) ), but I'm not sure. Or was it using the volume of the unit cell somehow?

Wait a minute, I think the formula for d in a rhombohedral crystal is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h k + h l + k l) * cos(alpha) ). Because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so the formula simplifies. So yes, that's it.

So the given plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. Let's plug those in.

First, compute the numerator and denominator parts.

Numerator is a =10 Angstrom.

Denominator part: (1^2 + 1
