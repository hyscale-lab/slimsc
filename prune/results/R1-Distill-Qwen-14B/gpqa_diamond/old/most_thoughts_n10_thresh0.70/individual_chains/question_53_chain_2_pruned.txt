Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, which is good to know because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and specific absorption bands. So, that tells me the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break them down. Two are aromatic-H, so the ring has substituents that cause splitting into two sets of aromatic protons. The two aromatic signals probably mean that the substituents are in para positions, or maybe the ring has some symmetry.

Then there are two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a carbon-carbon double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, esters usually have a carbonyl and an adjacent oxygen, but sometimes they might be part of a substituent. Hmm.

The other two signals are for –CH3 groups. No signals for –CH2 groups, which suggests there are no methylene groups (CH2) in the structure. So, all the carbons attached to protons are either CH or CH3.

Putting this together, the compound probably has an ester group attached to the aromatic ring. Since it's a di-substituted ring, there are two substituents. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, the substituents could be an ester group and another group. Or perhaps one of them is an ester. Wait, but it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So maybe one substituent is an ester group (like OOCR) and the other is something else, perhaps a methyl group or another substituent that's a vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR has signals for two –CH3 groups. So maybe the substituents are an ester and another group that has a methyl. Or perhaps it's a vinyl group attached as part of a substituent.

Wait, let's think about the ester structure. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So if one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-R), what's
