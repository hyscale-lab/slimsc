Okay, so I'm looking at this question about space travel and time dilation. Let me try to wrap my head around it. So, the scenario is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super-fast spaceship. The ship is going to travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast—close to light speed.

The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to figure out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are A through D, with A saying the astronaut dies before reaching Earth, and the others giving specific numbers. 

Wait, but wait. The problem says the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So, if the astronaut is 22, they have about 128 years left on average. So if the trip takes more than that, they wouldn't live long enough. But if it's less than that, they'd make it.

Now, how to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut. Oh right, this is a special relativity problem involving time dilation. Because the ship is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time will dilate for the astronaut relative to Earth's frame.

But wait, how do we calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut? Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame—in this case, the astronaut's frame. So we need to calculate the proper time for the journey.

I think the formula for time dilation is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where tau is the proper time, t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and v is the speed of the spacecraft. But wait, no, actually, the proper time is the shortest time between two events in the spaceship's frame. Or, alternatively, the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The spaceship is moving at velocity v relative to Earth. Earth observes the spaceship moving, and the astronaut's clock runs slower. But from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving, so the distance is contracted.

Wait, so maybe I should calculate the distance from the spaceship's point of view. Because the astronaut would perceive the distance as being shorter due to length contraction. So the time they experience is the contracted distance divided by speed.

Let me get the facts straight.
