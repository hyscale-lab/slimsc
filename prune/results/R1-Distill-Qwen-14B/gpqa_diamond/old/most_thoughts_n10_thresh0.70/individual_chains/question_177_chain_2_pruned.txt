Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's the peak wavelength for each star. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively.

The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2. They assumed the stars radiate as black bodies, so I think I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law here. Stefan-Boltzmann law says that luminosity L is proportional to radius squared times temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, but since it's a ratio, the constants will cancel out.

Wait, but the peak wavelength is the same for both stars. Oh right, the peak wavelength λ_max of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2.

But wait, no, the question says they observed the same wavelengths. So their blackbody curves peak at the same λ_max, so their temperatures are same. So T1 = T2.

So then, the luminosity depends on R² T⁴. Since T is same, L is proportional to R².

Star_1 has R = 1.5 R2. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, that part is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor would be approximately 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the radial velocities? The problem mentions radial velocities of 0
