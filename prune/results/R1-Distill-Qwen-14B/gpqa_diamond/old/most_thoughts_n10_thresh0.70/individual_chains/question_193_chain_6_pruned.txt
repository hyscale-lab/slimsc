Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again and think through it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars (I'll call it N) is proportional to 1/parallax^5, which is N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star shifts as seen from Earth's orbit. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, so d = 1/plx. That's the key relation.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we need to express N in terms of d, not plx. Let's see. Since d = 1/plx, that means plx = 1/d. Substituting that into the original proportion: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. 

Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/d)^5 is the same as 1 multiplied by (d)^5, because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance, r. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dr would be the derivative, right? Because when you have a distribution proportional to d^5, the number in a small range dr is approximately N dr = (proportional constant) * d^5 dr. So the number per unit distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to d^5. But wait, that's not matching the options exactly. 

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The number of stars as a function of distance. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx ∝ 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of d. So for each unit increase in distance, the number of stars increases by d^5 per unit distance? Or does it mean the density of stars?

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the density of stars as a function of distance. Because as you go further away, the same volume of space would contain fewer stars if density is lower. But in this case, the problem states that the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5, which is with d^5. So if you consider a volume of space at a distance d, perhaps the number of stars in that volume increases as d^5. But wait, that doesn't make much sense, because when you look further away, the volume of a shell increases with d^2 dr (since volume is 4πd² dr for a thin shell). 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the formula. The number of stars is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx =
