Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question gives me an unknown organic compound and some 1H NMR data. I need to figure out which structure it is among the four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

Hmm, I remember that NMR is all about the protons and their environments. Let's look at the data. The peaks are at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, 2.1 ppm, and 1.6 ppm.

So, the first peak is 7.0 ppm, integrating to 1H, and it's a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant. Wait, that must be a vinyl proton. Because in alkenes, protons split each other with large J values. 16 Hz is typical for trans coupling in alkenes, but I should think more about that.

The second peak is at 5.5 ppm, 1H, and it's a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, a doublet of quadruplets? That's a bit more complex. Maybe it's a coupling with two different neighboring protons. Since this is around 5.5, also a vinyl proton, perhaps part of an alkene.

The 2.1 ppm peak is a singlet with 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an ester. Because acetate esters have a methyl group adjacent to oxygen, which is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H. That looks like a methyl group attached to another carbon, perhaps as a CH2 or CH3 group nearby. Wait, wait. If it's a doublet, maybe it's a CH3 next to a CH that's coupled to something else. Like in an ethyl group or maybe a propenyl group.

Let me sketch the structures for each option to see what the NMR would look like.

First, the options:
1. Cis-propenyl acetate: Structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but wait, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but acetate is OAc. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, more accurately, the ester would be (O)C-O-R, where R is propenyl. So R is CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but as an ester, the structure would be something like CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so as an ester, it's CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O- group. So the ester would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait. Wait, let me think: propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So if it's propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should better draw the structures. Let me think:

- Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-.
- So propenyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Acetate is the acetyl group (CH3COO-), so when it's an ester, it's R-O-CO-R', where R' is the acetyl part. So propenyl would be the R group. So for propenyl acetate, R is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, no, the ester would be CH3CO-O-R, where R is the propenyl group. So R is CH2CH2CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me correct.

Wait, but wait. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- but as an ester, it's attached to the oxygen. So propenyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, because propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2- ? No, wait, maybe I should look at the correct structure.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so propenyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2, but wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps
