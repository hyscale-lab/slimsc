Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question says that a supernova occurs, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which means no acceleration, right? So we can probably use classical mechanics here since the speeds involved might not be relativistic. Wait, but the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, that's like 6e4 km/s. Let me think, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, that's a significant fraction. So maybe we can't ignore relativistic effects, but perhaps the problem expects us to use classical mechanics since it's an introductory question. Or perhaps the question is designed to ignore relativity because it's a Galilean transformation problem.

So the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, no, that's the velocity of the galaxy center as observed from the ejecta. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But in reality, since both are inertial frames, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy's center in the Galaxy's frame. So it's a case of relative velocity.

Wait, the question is about what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, from the ejecta's perspective, their own time is 50 seconds. But due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be different, right? Or wait, maybe not, because they're asking for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, no. Let's think about the frames. The galaxy is in one frame, the ejecta in another. The ejecta's frame is moving at v relative to the galaxy. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the galaxy. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So according to Galilean transformations, if the galaxy is moving at v in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta is moving at v in the opposite direction in the galaxy's frame. So v is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but in reality, the speed is the same in both frames but direction is opposite. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So in 50 seconds (as measured in the ejecta's frame), how far has the ejecta traveled in the galaxy's frame?

Wait, but time in the galaxy's frame might not be the same as in the ejecta's frame. Because according to relativity, moving clocks run slower. But the problem says
