Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says the particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. We need the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value—that's like the average value you'd measure if you measured this operator many times on identically prepared systems. Right, the formula for expectation value ⟨A⟩ is the conjugate of the state times A acting on the state, all integrated, but in this case, since it's a two-level system, it's manageable.

I remember that for a state |ψ⟩, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the operator and then add them together.

Let me write down the state. The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me compute each term. The operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation separately.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be easy. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state ψ is a linear combination, so when you compute ⟨σz⟩, it's the sum of the squares of the amplitudes times their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |√3/2|^2 * (-1). Let me compute that. |0.5|^2 is 0.25, times 1 is 0.25. |√3/2|^2 is (3/4) since (√3)^2 is 3, and 2 squared is 4. So 3/4 times (-1) is -3/4. Summing 0.25 and -0.75 gives -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the first term is 10 times that, which is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, let's compute ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not the same as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Oh wait, actually, wait: σx's eigenstates are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So when you have a state expressed in terms of σz eigenstates, you have to compute ⟨σx⟩ differently.

Wait no, I think the expectation value can still be calculated using the state ψ. The operator σx can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. So when we compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, we can expand it.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0,1]^T. So ψ is represented as [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write it out:

σx = [ [0, 1],
         [1, 0
