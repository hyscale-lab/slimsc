Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, I remember that pions can decay into other particles, like a muon and a neutrino in this case. The question says that the Pi(+) is stationary, which probably means it's initially at rest. 

The given masses are the rest masses: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have almost no rest mass. I think the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others, so maybe we can ignore it for this calculation.

So, the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum should still be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But the neutrino's rest energy is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy.

Wait, but the muon also has kinetic energy. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its total energy will be its rest energy plus kinetic energy. So, the total energy after decay is E_muon + E_nu. 

E_muon = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, energy is in units of MeV, and I think the formula is E² = (pc)² c² + (m c²)². So, E_muon = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). But I'm getting confused with the units here. Maybe I should just work in units where c=1 to simplify.

So, E_muon = sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu²). Similarly, for the neutrino, since its mass is zero (approximate), E_nu = p_nu. But since the total momentum must be zero, p_mu = -p_nu. So p_mu = p_nu in magnitude.
