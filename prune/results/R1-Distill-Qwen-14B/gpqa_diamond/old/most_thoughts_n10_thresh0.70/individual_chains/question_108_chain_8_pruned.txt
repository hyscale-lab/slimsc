Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a strength of 1 Tesla. They mention small values of m, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, the orbital quantum number is l, but m is the magnetic quantum number associated with l. Oh right, m can be -l, -l+1,...,0,...,l. So small m—maybe like m=0 or 1 or something.

The problem asks to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom that has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486.1 nanometers, which I think is in the visible range, perhaps the Balmer series or something. Like, the hydrogen spectrum's Balmer lines are around that wavelength.

So the first thing I need to do is calculate the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman energy, and the transition energy ΔE. Then compare their magnitudes.

The Zeeman effect energy is given by the formula E_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but wait—I remember that the orbital Zeeman effect is proportional to m, and the spin part is proportional to the spin magnetic quantum number, but the problem states that m is the orbital one, I think. So the paramagnetic coupling term here is the orbital Zeeman term.

Wait, correction: Paramagnetic coupling usually refers to the interaction of the magnetic moment with an external field. For an electron, the magnetic moment is due to both spin and orbital angular momentum. But since the question mentions m as the orbital magnetic quantum number, I think the term in question is the orbital contribution to the Zeeman effect.

Wait, but the orbital magnetic quantum number m is for the orbital angular momentum. So the energy shift due to the Zeeman effect for orbital m is given by E = -μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, wait, actually, the orbital magnetic moment is μ
