Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), which I think is a two-component vector. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin state of an electron is a two-component vector because electrons have spin-1/2. So the spin state is a vector in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. 

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket (or the conjugate transpose multiplied by the operator multiplied by the state), right? So for any observable, you take ψ† O ψ, where ψ is the state vector and O is the operator. 

The operator here is S_y, the spin along the y-direction. The problem gives σ_y as a matrix. Oh wait, σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y. So S_y must be (ħ/2) times σ_y because spin operators are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. 

Let me write down σ_y. The matrix is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. 

The state ψ is given as (3i, 4). So that's a column vector [3i; 4]. To find the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. 

Wait, but wait. The expectation value formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† S_y ψ. So I'll need to compute the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiply by S_y, then multiply by ψ.

First, let's compute the conjugate transpose of ψ. The original ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4. 

Wait, wait, hold on. The original state is (
