Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). 

The problem says that an electron is moving at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its location is Δx = 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE. Hmm, I think the Uncertainty Principle formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. 

Wait, but how does that relate to energy? Oh right, because the momentum is related to energy. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in momentum Δp would lead to an uncertainty in energy ΔE. 

Let me jot down what I know:
Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters.
v = 2e8 m/s. But wait, do I need the velocity for anything here? Because the problem gives me the speed, but the uncertainty is in the position, not the velocity. Hmm, maybe I can find the momentum from the velocity, but perhaps I don't need to because the Uncertainty Principle is directly about the product of position and momentum uncertainties.

So first, let's compute the minimum uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Using Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). 

What's the value of ħ? I think it's approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Plugging in the numbers: Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9). Let me calculate that denominator first: 2 * 0.1e-9 is 0.2e-9, which is 2e-10. So 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 equals approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is about 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, I need to relate this to the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The energy here is the kinetic energy, so E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in E, ΔE, would be ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m). Because when taking the uncertainty, if E is a function of p, the uncertainty in E is the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. The derivative dE/dp is p/m, but wait, wait, E = p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m. So the uncertainty ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. But wait, since p is an average, maybe I can approximate p as the average momentum, which would be m*v. Because p = m*v. 

Wait, but I have the velocity given as 2e8 m/s. Let me compute the momentum p: p = m*v. The mass of an electron is about 9.109e-31 kg. So p = 9.109e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s. 

But wait, that's the average momentum. The uncertainty in momentum is Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s, which is smaller than the average p. So when I compute ΔE, perhaps I can use the average p to calculate the scaling factor. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp = ( (m v)/m ) * Δp = v * Δp. 

Wait, that's an interesting approach. So substituting, v is 2e8 m/s, Δp is approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So ΔE ≈ 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = 1.054e-16 J. Hmm, wait, that's 1.054e-16 J, which is about 1e-16 J. 

Looking at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J. But wait, the calculations gave me 1.0
