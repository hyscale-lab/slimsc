Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Right, that's a standard harmonic oscillator setup. 

The problem is asking two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which pair is correct.

First, I remember that in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z. But wait, since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy depends on the sum of these quantum numbers. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The energy levels in 3D are actually E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So each direction contributes n_i + 1/2, and when you add them up, you get (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. 

But wait, another way to think about it: for each degree of freedom (x, y, z), the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω. So the total energy is the sum of the three. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes we write this as E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Yeah, that's right.

The third excited state. Wait, wait. Ground state is the lowest energy. So the first excited state is the next one. Let me clarify: the ground state would be n=0, which is (0
