Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals mass number 6. So X is Li-6.

So the task is to find the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a moving particle is given by the total energy formula, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First, I need to calculate gamma. Given v = 0.96c, let's plug that into the formula. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait wait, let me calculate that again. 0.28 is the square root part. So 1 / 0.28 is about 3.5714? Let me check: 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1, since 3.5714 * 0.28 is 1. So yeah, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy E0 is m0 * c². But I need to find m0 for Li-6. I remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but actually, it's a bit less due to binding energy. Wait, but for heavy ions like this, maybe I can approximate it as the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, but perhaps it would be easier to compute the atomic mass. Lithium-6 has an atomic number of 3 (since it's Lithium), so it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So the total mass of the nucleus would be (3 * 1.007276) + (3 * 1.008665) GeV/c².

Calculating that: 3 * 1.007276 is 3.021828 GeV/c². 3 * 1.008665 is 3.025995 GeV/c². Adding them together gives 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy is m0 c² = 6.047823 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that because the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of individual nucleon masses due to the mass defect from binding energy. Oh, right, but when calculating the rest energy for the purpose of gamma factors, we have to use the actual rest mass. Hmm, but perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of Li-6 can be found using the periodic table. Let me think, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0175769255 u (atomic mass units). Oh wait, I think I've heard that before. Each atomic mass unit (u) is about 0.931494 GeV/c². So I can convert that to GeV.

So the rest mass energy E0 is 6.0175769255 u * 0.931494 GeV/u. Let me compute that. 6 * 0.931494 is about
