Okay, so I've got this physics question about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But this is when the medium is stationary. What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh right, this is probably a problem involving relative motion. I think I need to consider how the movement of the glass affects the observed speed of light.

Wait, in classical mechanics, when you have a medium moving relative to an observer, the velocities add up. So if the medium is moving at velocity v, the speed of light in the medium would be v_medium + v. But wait, no, that's for when the light is moving at speed v_medium in the same direction as the medium's motion. So maybe the observed speed is the sum?

But wait, no. Because the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, according to Einstein's postulate. But wait, that's for inertial frames moving relative to each other. Hmm, but this might be a non-relativistic question because it's using v as a constant velocity, not a significant fraction of c.

Wait, the question gives the speed of light in vacuum as c
