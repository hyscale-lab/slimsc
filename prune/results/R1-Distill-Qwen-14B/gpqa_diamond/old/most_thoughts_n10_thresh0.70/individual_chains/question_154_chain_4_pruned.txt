Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, right? Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, so the question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I have to figure out which one it is using the given information.

First, let's look at the data provided. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's a peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Oh, wait, that might be a chlorine isotope because Cl has an atomic weight of about 35.5, so the molecular ion would have a Cl if present. The molecular weight is 156, and the other peak is 158, which is 2 more. That suggests Cl in the molecule because the Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes typically add about 2 m/z. So the molecular formula probably includes Cl.

Moving on to the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, where exactly? If it's broad and around 3500, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a big clue. That's in the range for a carbonyl group (C=O). A sharp peak suggests maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch, but if it's an ester, the O-H might not be present. Hmm, but let's think again. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is around 1720, that could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or acid. Wait, aldehydes have higher carbonyl peaks (like 1720 might be a bit low for an aldehyde, but I'm not sure). Carboxylic acids usually have a peak around 1700, but can vary. An ester might also be around there.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There's a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12, but that's for the -OH. Oh wait, but in the NMR, a singlet at 11 ppm, maybe it's an acidic proton. Let me thinkâ€”if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be broad because of the exchange, but here it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, the aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Hmm.
