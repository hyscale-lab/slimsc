Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But I'll try to tackle it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me visualize it. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group attached to the ring), and a cyano group. All three are meta to one another. Hmm, wait, meta to each other—so each of them is at positions that are two carbons apart? Or wait, "meta" means the substituents are each adjacent in a way that they are each separated by one carbon, right? No, wait, wait. On a benzene ring, when substituents are meta, they are at positions 1,3,5, or other combinations where each is two positions apart. So if three substituents are all meta, maybe they are at positions 1,3,5. But wait, benzene only has six positions. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the other two (carbaldehyde and cyano) would be at 3 and 5, but wait, the question says all three are meta to each other—so each substituent is meta, meaning all are at positions that are two apart from each other?

Alternatively, maybe I should sketch this out. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's assign positions 1 through 6 clockwise. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 2. Then, the other two substituents (carbaldehyde and cyano) would be at positions 5 and 7? Wait, no, benzene only has six positions. So maybe the carboxylic acid is at position
