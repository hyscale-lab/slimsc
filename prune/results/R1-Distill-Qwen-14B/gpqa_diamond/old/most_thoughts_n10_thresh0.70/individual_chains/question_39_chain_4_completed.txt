Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. Hmm, I remember that wave functions must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalized. Oh right, the normalization condition says that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, the wave function usually has to be a complex number, right? So this makes sense because it has an 'i' term. But when calculating the normalization, I think I should take the modulus squared, which is the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate, ψ*(x), would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. When I multiply them together, the imaginary parts should cancel out, leaving me with a real function.

To normalize ψ(x), I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 because measurements only found particles between 1 and 3. So |ψ|² is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a/s) - i(0.5) by (a/s) + i(0.5), you get (a/s)^2 + (0.5)^2. So yeah, that's correct.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1 + x) ) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

Breaking that down, the integral can be split into two parts: the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx and the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So this becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] which simplifies to a² ln(2), since ln(4)=2 ln(2) and ln(2) is subtracted, so 2ln2 - ln2 = ln2.

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

Adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

I should compute that. Let me think about the value of ln(2). I remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is approximately 0.7213. So a² is about 0.7213, which means a is the square root of that.

Wait, sqrt(0.7213) is about 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I handle the complex conjugate correctly? Yes, the modulus squared is correct. Did I compute the integral correctly? I think so. The integral from 1 to 3 of (a²)/(1+x) dx is a² ln(4/2) = a² ln2. The other part is 0.25*(2) = 0.5. So yes, the equation a² ln2 + 0.5 =1. So a² is 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. Square root is about 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space must equal 1. The given wave function is:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the measurements indicate that particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25.
\]

Splitting the integral into two parts:

1. **First part**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1 + x} \, dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x} \) is \( \ln(1 + x) \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second part**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding both parts:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849 \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
