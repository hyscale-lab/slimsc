Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star that's twice as far would have half the parallax.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? If they're uniformly distributed in space, that would mean the number density is constant. But wait, in reality, the galaxy isn't exactly uniform, but let's go with the assumption here.

So if the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density n is a constant. Let me think about how this relates to parallax. Parallax (plx) is related to distance (d) by plx = 1/(d) in parsecs, I think. So d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's say I have a small change in parallax, Î”plx. What is the number of stars in that range?

Wait, I think I should model this mathematically. Let's say we have a volume element. Since parallax relates to distance, I should probably consider a spherical shell at a certain distance d with thickness dd.

The volume of a spherical shell is 4
