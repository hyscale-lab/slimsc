Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup: There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, which I remember is twice the elementary charge, so that's 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. Their masses are negligible, so I probably don't need to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, just potential energy maybe.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So since we're dealing with charges and potential energy, this must be an electrostatic potential energy problem. I remember that the potential energy of point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

But wait, in this case, there are multiple charges. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up. But wait, how?

Wait a second, the problem says the system is isolated, so we're considering the electrostatic potential energy of the entire system. The formula for the total potential energy U of a system of multiple point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges divided by two, but I think in this case, since each pair is only counted once, maybe I don't need to divide by two. Wait, no, the formula is U = (1/2) * sum_{i<j} (k * q_i q_j / r_ij). Because each pair is counted once, so we sum for all i < j to avoid double-counting. 

So for 13 charges, the number of pairs is C(13,2) = (13*12)/2 = 78 pairs. But wait, but in this case, there's a fixed charge at P and 12 charges at 2 meters from P. So I think the potential energy comes from two parts: the energy
