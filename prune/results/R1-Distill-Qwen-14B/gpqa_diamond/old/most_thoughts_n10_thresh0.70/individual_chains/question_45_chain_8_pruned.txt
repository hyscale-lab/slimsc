Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The well has a length L, and we need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = (pi² ℏ²) / (2mL²), so each particle's energy levels are multiples of this E.

Hmm, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels for a single particle are quantized. The formula is E_n = (n² E), where n is the principal quantum number. So for each particle, the energy is E, 4E, 9E, 16E, 25E, etc., depending on n=1,2,3,...

But wait, these are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, spin-1/2 particles are fermions, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold at most two particles because of the two possible spin states (up and down) for each spatial state.

So the system's ground state would be the lowest possible energy configuration, considering the Pauli exclusion. Since they're fermions, each spatial orbital can have two particles with opposite spins.

Let me think about how the particles fill up the energy levels. Each level can have two particles. So for four particles, how do they fill the levels?

The ground state would be the lowest energy where each state is filled.

So the first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles. The second level (n=2) can also hold 2. So for four particles, both n=1 and n=2 are filled. So the system's ground state energy would be the sum of all occupied particles' energies.

Wait, but each particle's energy is n² E. Each particle in n=1 contributes 1E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E.

But wait, the particles are identical and in the same well. So the total energy would be the sum of each individual's energy. So, for four particles:

Two in n=1: each contributes E, so 2*E = 2E.

Two in n=2: each contributes (2²)E =4E, so 2*4E=8E.

So total is 2E + 8E =10E. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. No, that's not correct. Wait, no, wait: each particle in a particular state contributes n² E. But for identical particles, the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but the particles are in different states. Let me think again.

In the ground state, the lowest possible configuration would be that the first two particles (since they are spin-1/2) fill the n=1 level. Then the next two would go into the next available level, which is n=2. So each of those two contributes 4E. So the total energy for the system would be (2 * 1E) + (2 *4E) ) = 2E +8E =10E. Hmm, that seems right.

Wait, no, wait. Because each particle is in a different state. Or wait, no, for identical fermions, each state can have two particles. So for n=1, you can have two particles (spin up and down). Similarly, n=2 can have two particles. But wait, wait: n=1 has two particles, n=2 has two particles. So yes, four particles.

So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) )= 2E + 8E =10E.

Wait, but maybe that's not correct. Because for the ground state, all possible lower states are filled. So in a 1D box, the energy levels are E,4E,9E, etc. So the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) hold 2 particles each, so total four.

So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but the question is about the system's overall energy, so yes, it's the sum of all the individual energies.

Now, the first excited state. The first excited state would be the next possible configuration where the particles are in the next possible energy levels. So what's the next possible arrangement?

Wait, in the ground state, particles are in n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles
