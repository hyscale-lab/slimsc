Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So it's like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Since the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, that's the total concentration of calcium in the solution. So the total concentration [Ca²+]total is equal to [CaEDTA^2-] plus any free Ca²+ and free EDTA. But wait, under certain conditions, like when Kf is very large, the complex is stable, so the free Ca²+ is very low.

The problem says to assume the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is fully deprotonated and in its Y^4- form. So I can probably ignore the other forms of EDTA (like HY^3-, etc
