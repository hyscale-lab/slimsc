Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectral data given. Let's go through it step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and there's a peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, that's interesting. The molecular ion is usually the molecular weight, but the presence of a peak at m/z 158 suggests something about the molecular formula. Let me think: 158 is 156 plus 2. Maybe it's a doubly charged ion? Or perhaps it's a fragment. Alternatively, maybe there's an isotope involved. Chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope, so maybe the molecule has a Cl atom. Let me check the options later.

Next, the IR data: there's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, benzoic acids have O-H (carboxylic acid) which are broad. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid or an ester. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have lower frequencies, around 1700. Maybe it's a different carbonyl group, like an ester or a ketone? Or maybe it's a chloroformate, which has a higher carbonyl frequency around 1750-1720.

Looking at the options, options A and D are aldehyde and acid respectively. Option B is benzoic acid, and C is phenyl chloroformate. Let me think about each.

The 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H)—that's a strong signal. High ppm usually corresponds to deshielded protons. For aromatic protons, that's typically a para-substituted ring. But wait, 11 ppm is really high. That's more like an aldehyde proton, or maybe an O-H in a carboxylic acid. Wait, wait—wait, no. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Carboxylic acid O-H is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR, this peak is a singlet, which isn't typical for O-H because in D2O it would exchange and maybe not show, but in the data given, it's present. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 (like 9.8 or so) and singlet. But 11 is higher. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's an aldehyde with a hydroxyl group. So, in that case, the aldehyde proton would be around 9.8-10.5, but the hydroxyl would be a broad peak. But in the NMR, there's a singlet at 11 ppm—could that be the aldehyde? But wait, in the NMR, the proton is at 11.0, which is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Benzoic acid would have an O-H peak, which is usually broad, but here it's a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's not an O-H. Wait, another possibility is a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to a ring, but that might
