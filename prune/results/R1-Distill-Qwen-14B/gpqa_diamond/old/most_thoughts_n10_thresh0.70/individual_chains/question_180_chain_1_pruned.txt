Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charge. The setup is that there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So 2e would be double that, like 3.2 times 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, 13 particles each with 2e, so the total charge is 26e, but maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The problem says 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So I'm picturing point P with a fixed charge, and then 12 charges all at 2 meters away from P. I'm trying to visualize the setup. Are those 12 charges arranged in a circle around P? Or maybe they're all at the same distance but spread out in some configuration? But the exact arrangement might not matter for calculating the potential energy, since potential energy depends on the distances between each pair of charges.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Oh right, the potential energy of a system of charges. I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. And since potential energy is a function of configuration, the minimum energy would likely be when the system is as
