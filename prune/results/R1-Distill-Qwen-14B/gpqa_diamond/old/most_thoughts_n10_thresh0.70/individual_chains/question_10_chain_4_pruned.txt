Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm. Let me try to think it through. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. 

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, higher density means more mass packed into the same volume or a smaller volume for the same mass. Wait, but these are exoplanets, so their sizes and masses vary.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, Earth's density is known. I think Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. That's because Earth is made of rock and metal, heavier materials. So if the planet has the same mass and radius as Earth, its density is exactly Earth's density, which is 5.5. Okay, so option a has density 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's confusing. Because if the planet's density is given as 5.5, and it's twice Earth's mass, then what's its radius? Because density is mass/volume. So if density is 5.5, then volume is mass divided by 5.5. But the mass is 2 Earth masses. Let me calculate Earth's volume first. Earth's volume is (4/3)πr³. Since the planet has 2 Earth masses and 5.5 density, its volume would be (2 Earth masses) / 5.5. But wait, I'm not sure if they provided the mass or the radius. The question says the planet has a density of 5.5. So the density is 5.5 regardless of its mass. So its density is 5.5. So in terms of density, this is same as Earth. But wait, the question is about the highest density. So if this planet has 5.5, same as Earth, but does it have a higher density? No, same. Unless I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, no, the question is about the highest density, so a planet with higher density than others would be the answer.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Because the other options might have higher or lower density.
