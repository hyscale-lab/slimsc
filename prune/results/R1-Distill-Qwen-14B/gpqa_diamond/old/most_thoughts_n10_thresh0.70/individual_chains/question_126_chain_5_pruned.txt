Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two reactions done by an organic chemist. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns. I need to determine how many peaks they observe in each case.

First, let's break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material here is a ketone. The structure is hexan-3-one, so the ketone is at position 3. The substituents around it? Let's see: 5-methoxy. So, the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Or wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO-(CH2)3? Wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. Wait no, hexan has six carbons. So, position 3 is the ketone. So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3? Wait no, because the 5 position is methoxy. Oh wait, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3

But the 5th carbon is CH-OCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2
