Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets and studying stellar dynamics. But the specifics are a bit foggy. I think it's got a high signal-to-noise ratio capability, but how does that translate to detectability?

The question says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out for each star whether their S/N meets or exceeds 10.

The stars given are a to e, and we have options A to D as answers. Let's list them again:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with V=15 mag, 10 pc away
d) Same V=15, 200 pc
e) Same V=15, 5 pc
f) Same V=15, 50 pc

Wait, the options are a to f, so the options for the answer are A to D (with options A: 2 stars, B:5, C:4, D:3). So the question is how many of a to f are detectable.

I think I need to calculate the S/N for each star. To do that, I should probably use the formula that relates the S/N with the star's magnitude, exposure time, and other factors.

I remember that the S/N ratio for a star is given by something like S/N = 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m is the apparent magnitude, m0 is a reference magnitude, and t is the exposure time in seconds. Wait, or was it a different formula? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I can think of it differently.

Wait, I think the formula for S/N is S/N = (10^(-0.4 * (m - m0))) * sqrt(t), where m is the apparent magnitude, m0 is a magnitude where the S/N per unit time is 1, and t is the exposure time in seconds. Or perhaps it's a bit more precise than that.

Alternatively, another way is to consider the formula for the number of photons received. The S/N is proportional to the square root of the number of photons. The number of photons depends on the flux from the star, exposure time, and the collecting area of the telescope.

Wait, maybe I should look up the typical formula for S/N as a function of magnitude. Oh right! The formula is often expressed as:

S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m_0)) * sqrt(t)

But what's m_0? I think m_0 is the magnitude where S/N is 1 per second. Or perhaps m_0 is an instrument-specific value. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Alternatively, I remember that the S/N for a given star is proportional to the square root of the exposure time, and inversely proportional to 2.5^(0.4*Δm), where Δm is the difference between the star's magnitude and a reference.

Wait, another approach: The ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity curve might tell us the faintest magnitude it can reach for a certain S/N and exposure time.

Wait, but I don't have the exact sensitivity data. Hmm. Maybe I can find a standard way to compute this.

Wait, I recall that the V band (which is what V magnitude refers to) has a certain photon flux
