Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of bromine on different aromatic compounds, and I need to arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. Hmm, I remember that para-substituted products are major in cases where the directing groups are meta or para directors, but wait, the substituents on the benzene ring affect where the bromine will add.

Let me list out the substances first:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyl ethyl ester)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, I think I need to figure out each substituent's directing effect. Because that will determine where the bromine adds—ortho, meta, or para. But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So I need to determine, for each compound, the percentage of the para product when bromine is added in excess.

So, each substituent is an activating or deactivating group, and whether it's meta or para directing.

Let me go one by one.

1) Toluene: The substituent is CH3, which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine adds, the majority will be ortho and para. But the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction. Since toluene is activating, the reaction is more likely—so I think the para product will be significant. But wait, in toluene, the major products are ortho and para. But the para isomer is one of two major, so perhaps the para is about 30-40%? Or maybe higher? I'm not exactly sure.

2) Benzoyl ethyl ester: The substituent is COOEt (ester group). Esters are deactivating due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. They are meta-directing. So the bromine would add mainly in the meta position. Wait,
