Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a benzene ring connected to a CH2-CHO group. The "trans" part probably refers to the double bond geometry, but wait, cinnamaldehyde's structure is actually (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the double bond is between the second and third carbon, and the substituents (the phenyl and the aldehyde group) are on opposite sides.

First step: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide (MeMgBr), which is a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups. The starting material is an aldehyde, so the Grignard will add once. The aldehyde has the structure R-CHO. Adding MeMgBr would convert the aldehyde into an alcohol. Wait, no, actually, Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so the aldehyde becomes R-CH2-O-MgBr, but then after workup (acid), it becomes R-CH2-OH. Wait no, wait: aldehyde has RCHO. Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so the aldehyde becomes RCH2-O-MgBr, and upon protonation, RCH2-OH. Oh wait, no, wait again. Aldehydes have one R group. When Grignard adds, it adds twice? No, wait, no. Wait, no, Grignard adds once to aldehydes and ketones. So in an aldehyde, the Grignard adds once, giving RCH2-O-MgBr, which upon workup (adding acid) gives RCH2-OH. But wait, no, wait that doesn't seem right because the aldehyde is R-CHO. Grignard adds to the carbonyl carbon, so R-CHO + MeMgBr â†’ R-CH(O-MgBr)Me. Then, when you acidify, the O-MgBr becomes OH. So the product would be R-CH2-CH2-OH? Wait, no, let me think again. No, wait: the aldehyde is RCHO. Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so the aldehyde becomes RCH(O-MgBr)Me. Wait
