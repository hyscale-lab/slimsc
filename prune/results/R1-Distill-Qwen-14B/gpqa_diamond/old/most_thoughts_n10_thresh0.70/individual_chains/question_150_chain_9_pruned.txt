Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. The reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I need to figure out the final product from the options given.

Hmm, let's start by analyzing the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The 1H NMR peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H).

Breaking down the NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm is a triplet, integrating to 1H. That's a strong downfield peak, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group (-CHO) in the molecule.

- 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets, each integrating to 2H. These look like aromatic protons, probably from a para-substituted benzene ring. The splitting into doublets suggests coupling between two sets of equivalent protons. So maybe two aromatic rings, each with two equivalent protons. Wait, but if each is a doublet, perhaps they're in a para-substituted di-substituted ring, and the coupling is between adjacent protons.

- 6.27 is a broad singlet, integrating to 2H. Broad peaks could be due to exchange with protons, like those adjacent to an electronegative atom or maybe an enol form. Alternatively, maybe these are protons attached to an oxygen, like in a diol or something with an OH group. But a singlet would mean no neighboring protons. Or perhaps they're part of a conjugated system, like vinyl protons. Wait, but the broadness could suggest they're part of a neighboring group, like an enol or something with some acidity.

- 3.66 is a doublet, 2H. That's a lower ppm, around where CH2 groups adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen, might appear. For example, maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like a methylene group next to an O in an ether, ester, or amide. Or maybe it's part of a carbonyl group, like a ketone's adjacent CH2.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C8H9NO:

Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, where X is halogens, but here it's N. So formula is C8H9NO. So substituting:

2*8 +2 = 18. Subtract H (9), subtract N (1), so 18-9-1=8. Then divided by 2 is 4. So 4 degrees. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe a ring or another double bond. Or maybe a benzene ring, a double bond, and an oxygen ring or something else.

Wait, another approach: the aldehyde group suggests a carbonyl, that's a double bond. The aromatic rings from the NMR would contribute more double bonds. Let me think about the structure.

Looking at the NMR, there are two sets of aromatic protons. 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets. That suggests two para-disubstituted rings. Wait, perhaps each of those is a para-substituted benzene with another substituent. Or maybe it's a single benzene ring with two substituents. Wait, but each is a doublet, 2H each, so maybe two separate benzene rings, each with two substituents in para position?

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. Each benzene is 6 carbons, but the formula is C8, so perhaps two benzene rings would be 12, which is too much. So that can't be. So perhaps it's a single benzene ring and other substituents.

Wait, then the other groups must account for 2 more carbons. Let me think: a benzene ring (6 C) plus a side chain with 2 C, but the formula is 8, so maybe the substituent is more than that. Alternatively, perhaps it's two benzene rings attached to a side chain, but that would require more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. The aldehyde is one group, then there's a benzene ring attached, perhaps with another substituent.

Wait, let me try to think. The aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm. Then the aromatic signals are 6.98 and 6.51. Let's say the compound is a di-substituted benzene, perhaps with an aldehyde group and another group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring attached to a side chain that includes the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options might help. The options are various aldehydes with diphenyl groups. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So, but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO? Wait, but the structure would have a double bond between C3 and C4, making it an enal. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with another Ph group at position 2 and 4? Wait, but but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CHO, but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with another substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a but-3-enal, meaning the double bond is between C3 and C4, so structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait,
