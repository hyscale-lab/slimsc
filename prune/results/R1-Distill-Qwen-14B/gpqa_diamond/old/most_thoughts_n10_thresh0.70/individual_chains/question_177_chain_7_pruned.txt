Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

Alright, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

The problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh wait, that's about blackbody radiation. I think Wien's Law comes into play here. Wien's Law states that the wavelength at which a blackbody radiates most intensely is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K).

Since the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, that can't be right. Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be same. So T1 = T2? Let me think again. Oh yes, because λ_max is proportional to 1/T, so if λ_max is same, T must be same. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but there's another factor here. The radial velocities. Oh, right! The Doppler effect affects the observed wavelength. Because Star_2 is moving towards us (radial velocity of 700 km/s), its light would be blueshifted. But the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1, which has zero radial velocity. So I need to account for the Doppler shift when considering the actual temperature.

Wait, let's clarify. The
