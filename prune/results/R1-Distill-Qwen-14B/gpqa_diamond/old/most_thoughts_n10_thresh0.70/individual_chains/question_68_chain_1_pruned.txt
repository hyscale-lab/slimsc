Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. So, the setup is that there's a particle with spin 1/2, and its magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic moment is related to the spin. For spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator Sz has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, but when multiplied by gamma, the magnetic moment would be gamma times that. So mu_z is gamma * S_z.

Initially, the magnetic field is along Z. That means the system is in an eigenstate of Sz. So the spin is either up or down along Z. But then the magnetic field is switched to Y. So the Hamiltonian changes from something proportional to Sz to something proportional to Sy.

Wait, when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - mu · B, right? Because the magnetic moment interacts with the field. So H would be proportional to Sy. Let's see: H = - (gamma S_z) * B in the Z-direction, but when the field is along Y, H = - (gamma S_y) * B. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the interaction energy is H = - mu · B. So, when B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B (S_y).

Wait, no wait. The magnetic moment mu is defined as mu
