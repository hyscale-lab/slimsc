Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. That probably means that their density is uniform, right? So, same number of stars in any given volume of space. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. I remember that the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx.

Wait, so if stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume should depend on that volume. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which I think is like a differential quantity.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's say I have a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx. I want to find how many stars are in that range. Since parallax relates to distance, I can relate this to a shell in space. So, each shell at a certain distance would correspond to a certain parallax.

The number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius (distance) and dr is the thickness. Since dr is the change in distance, and plx is 1/r, so dr = - (1/(plx²)) dplx. Wait, let me think about that. If plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So, dr = derivative of r with respect to plx multiplied by dplx. dr/dplx = -1/(plx²), so dr = -dplx / plx². Hmm, but I'm looking at a range, so maybe I can take the absolute value as it's a positive thickness.

So, the volume of the shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) )? Wait, no. Wait, wait, let's clarify.

The shell's volume is 4π r² dr. Here, dr is the change in radius. Since plx = 1/r, dr = d(1/plx) = - (1/plx²) dplx. But when plx increases, r decreases, so for a positive dplx, dr is negative. But when considering the number of stars, we're interested in the magnitude. So, dr = (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, no, plx is inversely proportional to r, so if plx increases by dplx, r decreases. So, dr is negative, but for the volume, we take the positive change. Hmm, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of plx.

So, the number of stars (N) in a shell between plx and plx + dplx would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density (n), which is constant. So N = n * 4π r² dr. Since r = 1/plx, substituting that in, N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But dr is the change in r, which is dr = (d(1/plx)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, plx is 1/r. So, when plx increases by dplx, r decreases by dr. Let's express dr in terms of dplx.

Since plx = 1/r, taking the derivative, dplx = - (1/r²) dr → dr = - r² dplx. But since r is positive, dr is negative when dplx is positive, meaning the shell is at a smaller distance when plx increases. But since we're talking about a thin shell, the thickness is dr, which is negative. But for the volume, we take the absolute value, so dr = r² |dplx|.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express the volume in terms of plx. Let's see.

r = 1/plx, so dr = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx is -1/(plx²). So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But because we're considering a small change in plx, the negative sign just indicates direction. The actual thickness in terms of r is positive, so the volume element is 4π r² * |dr|. So, substituting r = 1/plx, and dr as (1/plx²) dplx (taking absolute value), the volume becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx) ?

Wait, no, that's not right. Because dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. But wait, n is the number per unit volume, so the total in the shell is n * volume.

So, the number per unit plx range is N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which I think is the number per dplx. So, it's N/(dplx) = 4π n / plx^4. So, the number density in plx space is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that gives an option A) ~1/plx^4. But I'm a bit confused because I've seen that in some cases, like for luminosity functions, the number of stars per unit distance might have different dependencies. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the volume in terms of parallax. So, the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those parallaxes.

Wait, the volume of a shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. But since r = 1/plx, dr = (dr/dplx) dplx = (-1/(plx)^2) dplx. So, substitute into the volume:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx)^2 dplx ) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Because the negative just indicates direction, so the actual volume is positive, so take the absolute value.

So, the volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So, the number per unit plx is 4π n (1/plx^4) → so the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are A) ~1/plx^4. So, that would be the answer, right? So option A.

But wait, I thought maybe the answer would be different. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So, the number of stars in a small volume dV is n dV. The volume dV at a distance r with parallax plx is a thin spherical shell. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. So, dN = n * 4π r² dr.

But plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting, dN = n *4 π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx → dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx. So, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is dN/dplx = 4π n/(plx^4). So, the number density is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the correct option is A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning their number density \( n \) is constant. The parallax \( \text{plx} \) is related to the distance \( r \) by \( \text{plx} = 1/r \), so \( r = 1/\text{plx} \). The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density \( n \). 

The volume of a thin spherical shell is given by:

\[
dV = 4\pi r^2 dr
\]

Substituting \( r = 1/\text{plx} \), we find:

\[
dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}
\]

Taking the absolute value for the thickness, \( dr = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( r = 1/\text{plx} \) and \( dr \) into the volume expression:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:

\[
dN = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., \( dN/d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
