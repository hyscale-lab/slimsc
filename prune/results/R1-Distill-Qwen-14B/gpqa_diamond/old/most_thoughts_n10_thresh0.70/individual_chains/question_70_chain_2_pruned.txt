Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are determined based on the shape of the molecule and the types of symmetry operations it possesses. Common groups include things like Cn, Dnh, Td, Oh, I, etc. I think D∞h is for something like a linear molecule with infinite symmetry along the axis, like CO2 maybe? Wait, no, CO2 is D∞h, right? Or wait, maybe that's for something else. Alternatively, maybe D4h is for something like methane but with higher symmetry.

Wait, let's start by figuring out what each compound is based on the reactions given.

First, the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I can backtrack to find possible compounds.

Let's start with reaction 4. D and B form H, a solvent. Solvents are often things like water, ethanol, maybe something else. Wait, but D and B are gases. So gas B reacts with gas D to form H. Common gas reactions to form solvents... Let me think. If H is a common solvent, perhaps H is something like HCl (but that's a gas), or maybe H is an alcohol? Wait, but B is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a halogen, like Cl2 or Br2. Because in reaction 4, D and B (a gas) react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Suppose B is Cl2. Then D could be something that reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio. Let me think—maybe D is H2O? Wait, but H2O is a liquid or gas depending on temperature. Or perhaps D is something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe D is a gas like NH3. Wait, but ammonia is a gas under certain conditions. If B is Cl2, then D could be something that reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, H could be NH4Cl, but that's solid, not a solvent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe H is HCl, but HCl is a gas, so that doesn't fit as a solvent.

Wait another angle: reaction 3. C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it produces two acids—maybe sulfuric acid (strong) and another, like HNO3 or something else? Or maybe one is HCl and another is something else. Wait, but F is strong, G is weak.

Wait, another thought. When C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. So perhaps C is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is a nitrate salt. Wait, but let's see.

Looking back at reaction 1: A and B form C. If A is a solid and B is a gas, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. Like, for example, A could be sodium (Na), B could be Cl2. Then reaction 1 would be Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But wait, sodium is a metal, and Cl2 is a diatomic gas. The product would be NaCl, which is a solid. But in the question, product C is bright red. Hmm, NaCl is white, not red. So that's probably not right.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is P and B is Cl2. Reaction: 4P + 3Cl2 → PCl5.
