Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator. Let's start by breaking down what's given.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, and it's given by Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So I can write that out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay is c multiplied by S. So I can compute Ay:

c = h/(4π), so:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which makes Ay:

[[0, -i * h/(4π)],
 [i * h/(4π), 0]]

Wait, no. Wait, actually, matrix multiplication by a scalar; each element is multiplied by c. So the (1,2) element is (-i)*c, and the (2,1) is (i)*c.

So, Ay's matrix is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ [ -a, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [ i*(h/(4π)), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Wait, wait, the determinant for a 2x2 [[a, b],[c, d]] is ad - bc. So here, it's (-a)(-a) - [ (-i c) * (i c) ]

Wait, let's compute each element:

Top left: -a
Top right: -i*(h/(4π))
Bottom left: i*(h/(4π))
Bottom right: -a

So the determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i c) * (i c) ]

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

The (1,1) element is -a, (1,2) is -i c, (2,1) is i c, (2,2) is -a, where c = h/(4pi).

So determinant is (-a)*(-a) - (-i c)(i c)

Simplify:

= a² - [ (-i)(i) c² ]

Because (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² (since c is scalar). Let's compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c².

Set determinant to zero: a² - c² = 0 => a² = c² => a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c.

Wait, but wait: c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) and -(h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the answer options, let me check.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). But our eigenvalues are real? Because the determinant gave real a's.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the matrix Ay. Let me see: Ay is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and off-diagonal elements that are purely imaginary. Because in the matrix:

[ [0, -i c],
