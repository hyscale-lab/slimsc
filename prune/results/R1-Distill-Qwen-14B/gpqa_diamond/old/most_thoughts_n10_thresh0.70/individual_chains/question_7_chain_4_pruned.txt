Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by the process γγ → e+e-. Right, I remember that this process is a way gamma-rays can lose energy, and when the probability becomes significant enough, the gamma's lifetime (or mean free path) is affected.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Oh wait, that's 1 keV? No, wait, 1e-3 eV is 1 milli-eV, right? So 0.001 eV. That's really low energy, which makes sense because CMB photons are very low energy, like the remnant of the big bang.

I remember that the cross-section for this annihilation process depends on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. The cross-section is a function of the center-of-mass energy. The process is more probable when the combined energy is sufficient to produce electron-positron pairs, which requires at least twice the electron mass energy, since each has about 0.511 MeV. So the threshold energy for the reaction would be when the sum of the two photons' energies is about 1.022 MeV. But wait, each photon is a CMB photon and the gamma-ray photon.

Wait, no. The process is γ + γ → e+ + e-. So each photon must have enough energy. The center-of-mass energy squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since for photons, E = pc, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 cos something. Wait, no, wait, I think another approach is better.

The maximum energy that a photon must have to annihilate with a CMB photon is when the CMB photon is at rest, but that's not the case. Alternatively, the cross-section for this reaction peaks when the center-of-mass energy is around the threshold 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So when the product of the two photon energies is at least
