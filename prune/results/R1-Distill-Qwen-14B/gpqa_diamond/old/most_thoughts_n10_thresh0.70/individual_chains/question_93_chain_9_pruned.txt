Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of nucleic acids, like DNA or RNA. The scientist made a calibration curve by using a positive control with known copy numbers and ran serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle should double the DNA. R2 being 1 implies a perfect correlation, so the data should fit the curve perfectly.

The slope of the curve is given as -3.3. Wait, I remember the formula for the slope in a qPCR calibration curve. Oh right, the expected slope is -3.32 if the efficiency is 100%. So a slope of -3.3 is very close to that. That makes sense because the efficiency is 100%, so the calculation should be spot on.

Looking at the data, each concentration has three technical replicates. Let me check the Ct values. For 100,000 copies, the Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2. For 10,000 copies, the Ct's are 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Hmm, that's a 3.6 Ct difference between the highest and lowest concentration. Wait, let me see the differences between each dilution.

Each dilution is a tenfold decrease. So 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution. The Ct should increase by 3.3 cycles because each dilution step (log10) corresponds to a certain number of Ct cycles. Since the efficiency is 100%, the expected change is about 3.32 Ct per 10-fold dilution. Here, the change from 100,000 to 10,000 is 3.6 Ct, which is a bit higher than expected, but wait, the options are about why there are discrepancies.

Wait, looking at the options, the question is about why the Ct values are not matching. The question says, which option explains the discrepancies in his results. Let me read each option.

Option A: qPCR can't be used for quantification. No, qPCR is used exactly for quantification, so this isn't right.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with target nucleic acid. But wait, the RÂ² is 1, meaning the Ct values perfectly correlate with the concentrations. So the data fits the model, which suggests that the Ct's do agree. So maybe B is not the correct answer.

Option C: Tenfold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, each tenfold dilution is expected to be about 3.32 cycles. Here, the change in Ct between 100,000 and 10,000 is 3.6, which is just a bit more than 3.3. So each dilution is a
