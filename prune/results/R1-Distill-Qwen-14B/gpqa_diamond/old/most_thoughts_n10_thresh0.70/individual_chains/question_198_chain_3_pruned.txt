Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these equilibrium and stability constant problems. But let me try to take it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D, and I'm guessing it's one of the middle ones, but I'm not sure yet.

First, I remember that stability constants tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex forms. So β4 is 16, which is higher than β1 and β2 but lower than β3. Wait, but the order is β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the largest, meaning the complex with three SCN- ions is the most stable. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the one with two SCN- ions, so that would be β2=40.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the complexes. Cobalt can form various complexes with thiocyanate. The general formula is Co(SCN)n^2−n, so for n=1, it's [Co(SCN)]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc. The blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex, I think. So the question is about the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 species, which is the dithiocyanato complex.

The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), includes all possible species: Co²+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^-1, [Co(SCN)₄]^2- perhaps? Or maybe up to n=4 as per the given βs.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with n=1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ions. So the complexes are:

n=1: Co²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ ; β1=9
n=2: [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ; β2=40 (so the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β2 = 40)
Wait, no, wait. The stability constant for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the ions. So for each step, the β is the stepwise constant. So the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs up to that point.

Alternatively, sometimes the overall β is given as
