Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's Lithium-6 because natural lithium has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number is 6.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the Lorentz factor or gamma (γ) to calculate energies. The energy of a particle is given by E = γ * m * c². But wait, what's the rest mass here? Oh right, the nucleus is a collection of protons and neutrons, so maybe I should find the mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus.

I think the atomic mass unit (u) comes into play here, and I remember that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Lithium-6 (Li-6), which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass would be the sum of these. Let me calculate that.

So, 3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = let's see, 3*1.007 is about 3.021, but more precisely, 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.

3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u.

Adding them together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.047823 u.

But wait, I think the exact mass might be slightly different because some binding energy is involved. Oh, but the problem probably expects me to use the sum of individual nucleon masses, unless given a specific atomic mass. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6 from the periodic table. Hmm. Let me think. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. The standard atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u, but wait, maybe I'm confusing with the mass defect. Alternatively, perhaps using the sum as I did would be correct in the context of the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me think again. A proton is 1.007276 u, neutron 1.008665 u. So 3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u. 3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u. Total mass: 6.047823 u. So the rest mass m is 6.047823 u.

But wait, another thought: the actual mass of the lithium-6 nucleus is less than the sum because of the binding energy. But for the purpose of calculating the rest mass energy, perhaps the problem expects me to use this sum, or perhaps the exact value. Hmm. Well, maybe I should proceed with the sum, as I don't have the exact mass given.

Next, I need to calculate the energy when the speed is 0.96c. The speed is given as v = 0.96c, so I can find gamma (γ) using the formula γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.0784) = let me calculate that. 0.28^2 is 0.0784, because 0.28*0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Therefore, γ is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286. Hmm, wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/0.28 is 25/7 which is approximately 3.57142857.

But let me double-check the calculation. 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714286.

So E = γ * m c^2. But wait, the rest mass m is in atomic mass units, so I need to convert that into energy terms. One u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², because 1 u =
