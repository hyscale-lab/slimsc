Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a spin-half particle in a specific state, which is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states. The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, okay.

Wait, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So for a given state, you calculate the expectation by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the state vector again.

But wait, σz and σx are Pauli matrices. I remember Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. So let me write them down.

The σz matrix is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. And σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So the operator in question is 10σz +5σx. So, 10 multiplied by σz, plus 5 multiplied by σx.

The state is given as a vector. Let me represent it as a column vector. The state vector is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So in vector form, that's [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, because |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1], so when you take the linear combination, it's 0.5 times [1;0] plus sqrt(3)/2 times [0;1], which gives [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

To find the expectation value of the operator, E, I think the formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute this.

Wait, but the operator is 10σz +5σx. Since expectation is linear, I can split this into two terms: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation
