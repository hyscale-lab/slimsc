Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two salts, A and B, mixed in equimolar amounts. The total mass is 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes without cooling.

The first tube contains anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The weight increased by 3.60 grams. Then there's a second tube with Ca(OH)2 solution, but its weight didn't change. The third tube has red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80 grams, forming CuO. Finally, only 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are 13, 19, 17, 15.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what the gases are. The setup involves several reactions.

When salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. The first thing that comes to mind is that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. So, when the gas mixture passes through it, Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs moisture. Wait, but it's anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. So when it absorbs water, it would form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So the weight gain in tube 1 (3.60 g) must be the amount of water vapor in the gas. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant and will gain water.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change, so the gas passing through must not have reacted with Ca(OH)2. That suggests that any acidic gases, like CO2, which would react with Ca(OH)2, were not present. Or perhaps they were already absorbed by the first tube? Hmm, not sure yet.

The third tube is red-hot copper. The gas reacted to form CuO, and the tube gained 0.80 grams. So the gas here must be something that reacts with copper. Carbon monoxide (CO) can reduce CuO to Cu, but wait, if the copper is red-hot, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, when CO is passed over hot copper, it gets oxidized to CO2. Or wait, no, let me think: CO is a reducing agent. It can reduce metal oxides. So when CO is passed over CuO (which is not present initially, but maybe the copper is oxidizing?), perhaps the copper is in a reduced state. Wait, no, the copper in the tube is probably in the form of elemental copper (Cu). So when CO is passed, it would react by oxidizing, producing CO2 and CuO. Or wait, maybe the gases contain CO, which would react with the copper.

Wait, let me think again. When a gas passes through red-hot copper, if the gas is CO, it would react as follows: 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. Or maybe more accurately, the reaction is:

CO + Cu → CuO + ... wait, perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2, which would react with CuO, but that might not fit here. Alternatively, maybe the gas contains CO and H2; but let's see.

The third tube's weight gain is 0.80 grams, which would be the mass of the product. Since CuO is formed, the mass increase is due to oxygen. Because the copper is already present (as Cu metal), any oxygen in the gas would form CuO. So, the gain is the mass of the oxygen consumed.

Wait, the copper
