Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible states, compute E for each, and sum e^(-βE).

Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all. 

Each state can be represented by the triplet (S1, S2, S3), where each is +1 or -1. So the possible states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E. Let's find E for each of these.

The energy formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me break this down into each term.

Let me compute each term for each state.

State 1: All +1s.
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum = 3 → E = -J *3 = -3J

State 2: (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum =1-1-1 = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J

State 3: (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum =-1+1-1= -1 → E= J

State4: (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
Sum =-1-1+1 =-1 → E= J

State5: (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)*1= -1
S1S3=(-1)*1= -1
S2S3=1*1= 1
Sum= -1-1+1= -1 → E= J

State6: (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2=(-1)*1= -1
S1S3=(-1)*(-1)= 1
S2S3=1*(-1)= -1
Sum= -1+1-1= -1 → E= J

State7: (-1, -1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)*(-1)=1
S1S3=(-1)*1= -1
S2S3=(-1)*1= -1
Sum=1-1-1= -1 → E= J

State8: All -1s.
S1S2=1
S1S3=1
S2S3=1
Sum=3 → E = -3J

Wait, let me double-check states 2 through 7. Oh, I think I made a mistake in some calculations. Let me re-calculate each state properly.

State 2: (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum=1-1-1 = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J. Correct.

State3: (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2=1*-1 =-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*(1) =-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J. Correct.

State4: (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2=1*-1 =-1
S1S3=1*-1 =-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)= 1
Sum: -1-1+1 =-1 → E=J. Correct.

State5: (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)*1= -1
S1S3=(-1)*1= -1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: -1-1+1= -1 → E=J. Correct.

State6: (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2=(-1)*1= -1
S1S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
S2S3=1*(-1)= -1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J. Correct.

State7: (-1, -1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)(-1)=1
S1S3=(-1)(1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)(1)=-1
Sum: 1 -1 -1= -1 → E= J. Correct.

State8: All -1.
Sum is 3 → E = -3J.

So the energies are as follows:

States 1 and 8 have E=-3J.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have E=J.

Wait, that's 6 states with E=J and 2 with E=-3J.

Wait no, the states 1 and 8: state 1 is all +1s, state 8 is all -1s.

So the energies are:

-3J for two states.

J for six states.

Wait, that's correct. Because for three spins, how many states have all spins same? Only two: all up or all down. So two states with sum 3, others have sum -1.

Wait no, in state 2, the sum was -1, but that's because S1S2 is 1, but S1S3 and S2S3 are -1 each.

So the energy for those states is E = -J*(sum) → for sum = -1, E= J*(1) → because E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, the sum for state 2 is 1-1-1= -1, so:

E = -J * (-1) = J. Correct.

So in total:

Number of states with E = -3J: 2.

Number of states with E = J: 6.

Wait, but wait. Let me count again.

State 1: E =-3J.

States 2-7: all have E= J. That's 6 states.

State 8: E=-3J.

So 2 states at E=-3J, 6 at E=J.

Thus, the partition function Z is sum over all states of e^(-β E).

Each state contributes e^(-β E) to Z.

So for each state with E=-3J, the contribution is e^(3 β J) because -β * (-3J) = 3 β J.

Each state with E=J → e^(- β J), because -β * J = -β J.

So Z = 2 * e^(3 β J) + 6 * e^(- β J).

Wait, let me compute that. So:

2 states with E=-3J: each contributes e^(3 β J), so 2 e^{3β J}.

6 states with E= J: each contributes e^{-β J}, so 6 e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2 e^{3β J} +6 e^{-β J}.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)
Which is 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → which would correspond to 2 states with E=3J and 6 with E=-J. But wait, in our case, the higher energy is J, not -3J.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait the energy E is given as -J times the sum. So when the sum is positive, E is negative. So when sum is 3, E is -3J. When sum is -1, E is J.

So when the sum is 3, E is negative. So higher energy (more E) when sum is lower.

Wait, but in terms of partition function, each state contributes e^{-β E}.

So for a state with E = -3J: e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3β J}.

For a state with E= J: e^{-β*(J)} = e^{-β J}.

So the Z is 2 * e^{3 β J} +6 * e^{- β J}.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Z= 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- Jβ} → which is what we have.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ} → that would be if the energies were 3J and -J.

Option B: 2e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ} → which is what I have.

So the correct Z is option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ). Yeah, that's what I have.

Wait, but another way: perhaps I made a mistake in how the energies are calculated.

Wait, wait. Let me re-express the energy. The energy is E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So for each state, sum the products, multiply by -J.

So when the sum is 3, E= -3J. So for that state, e^{-β E} is e^{3β J}.

Other states have sum = -1 → E= J. So e^{-β E} = e^{-J β}.

So for each of the 6 such states, that's 6 e^{-J β}.

So Z= 2 e^{3 β J} +6 e^{- β J}.

Which matches option B.

So the answer should be option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by considering the energy given by \( E = -J [S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{1}{kT} \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state is represented by the triplet \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) \), and the energy \( E \) is calculated for each state.

### Step 1: Compute energy for all states
The energy is determined by \( E = -J [S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). The possible states and their corresponding energies are:

1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum \( = 3 \), \( E = -3J \).
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum \( = -1 \), \( E = J \).
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum \( = -1 \), \( E = J \).
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum \( = -1 \), \( E = J \).
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum \( = -1 \), \( E = J \).
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum \( = -1 \), \( E = J \).
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum \( = -1 \), \( E = J \).
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum \( = 3 \), \( E = -3J \).

### Step 2: Classify states by energy
From the above, two states have \( E = -3J \) (all spins aligned), and six states have \( E = J \) (mixed spins).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2 \cdot e^{-\beta (-3J)} = 2 \cdot e^{3\beta J} \).

For the six states with \( E = J \), the contribution is \( 6 \cdot e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as it swaps the energies).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived result).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is given by **Option B**.

Answer: B
