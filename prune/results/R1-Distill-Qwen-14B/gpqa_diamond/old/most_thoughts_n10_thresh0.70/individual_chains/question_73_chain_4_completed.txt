Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think through this.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, right. I remember that in relativity, adding velocities isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Oh wait, right! The formula for relative velocity isn't just subtracting them. There's a specific equation from special relativity.

The formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving at speeds u and v relative to a third frame (like the Earth here) is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, but wait, which one is moving faster? The first astronaut is at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7. Let me calculate that, 0.1/0.7 is about 0.14286, so approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now for the total energy. I think each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c², but wait, the masses are different. So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.6c, v² is 0.36c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m_rest * c². Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, the second astronaut has mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So v² is 0.25c². 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt is about 0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547 (since 0.866 is sqrt(3/4) = approx 0.866, so reciprocal is 2/sqrt(3) which is about 1.1547). So E2 = gamma * 3m c² = 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, wait, but wait! Wait a second. Wait, the masses are 2m and 3m, but in relativity, the rest mass is what's important. So each energy is gamma times their own rest mass energy. So E1 is gamma1 * (2m) c², E2 is gamma2 * (3m) c².

So adding E1 and E2, total energy E_total is (1.25 * 2m + 1.1547 *3m) c². Let me compute that.

1.25 * 2m = 2.5 m.

1.1547 *3m ≈ 3.464 m.

So adding them gives 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m. So E_total ≈ 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc².

So the total energy would be approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking back at the options, option C is the one with both correct values.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative velocity and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Velocity
The relative velocity between two objects moving at speeds \( u \) and \( v \) in the same direction is given by the relativistic formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the first astronaut moves at \( u = 0.6c \) and the second at \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \) and the total energy is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
