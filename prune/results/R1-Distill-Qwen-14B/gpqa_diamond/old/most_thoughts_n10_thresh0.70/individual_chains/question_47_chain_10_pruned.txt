Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about identifying a compound using spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. The options given are A to D, each a different organic compound. I need to think through each piece of data provided and see which option fits best.

Let me start by looking at the IR data. The IR shows strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has both N and O in the formula, I think these might be from an amide or maybe an amine or a phenol. But phenol's O-H is usually broader and maybe around 3200-3600. Alternatively, an amide would have N-H stretches. The other strong band is at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from an amide, ester, or maybe a ketone, but given the formula, probably an amide or ester.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The signals are:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet with three protons. A triplet in this region suggests a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something that splits the signal into a triplet. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethyl ether.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet with two protons. Broad signals can be due to exchange, like NH or OH groups. But in the IR, we saw possible N-H stretches, so maybe these are NH protons? Or maybe they're part of an OCH2 group, but the broadness makes me think it's NH because OH might be even broader or split differently.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet with two protons. A quartet here suggests a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, maybe in an ester group. Like OCH2CH2O or something similar. Wait, but in esters, it's usually OCH2CH3. But here the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit upfield for an ethyl group adjacent to oxygen. Wait, perhaps it's an acetyl group attached to something else, like a CH2COOR.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This looks like a substituted benzene ring with two substituents para to each other. The two doublets suggest that the ring has two sets of protons, each as a doublet. So maybe the substituents are in the para positions, making the ring have two sets of equivalent protons. 

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. Let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents on the benzene would be at positions 3 and another? No, benzamide would have the amide group as one substituent and ethoxy at 3, making it meta. That would not give a para substitution which would lead to two doublets in the aromatic region. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 3 and 4? Wait, no, 3-ethoxy would have the ethoxy in the meta position relative to the amide. So the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and para positions relative to the ethoxy, which might give different splitting. Hmm, maybe that's not the case here.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide has the structure RCONH2, but in this case, it's N-substituted. The phenyl group is substituted with an ethoxy at para position. So the substituents are the ethoxy at para and the formamide at another position? Wait, formamide is HCONH2. If it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl), the structure would be HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the phenyl ring has substituents at the 4 position (ethoxy) and the amide group is attached at some other position. Wait, no. Formamide is HCONH2. So N-substituted would be HCONR2. So in this case, the substituent is on the NH2. So the structure would be HCONHR', where R' is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the benzene would only have the ethoxy group in the para position. No other substituents? That would mean the benzene ring would have two substituents: the ethoxy and the formamide group. Wait, no, the formamide is connected to the benzene via the N. So the benzene would have the ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1, perhaps. So the substituents are at 1 and 4. That would make the protons on the benzene ring in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent) and positions 3 and 5 (meta). But wait, in that case, the protons would be in two sets: those ortho to substituents and those meta. So perhaps the aromatic protons would show as two different doublets. But for a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is at position 4, so the ring would have substituents at position 1 (the formamide) and 4 (ethoxy).
