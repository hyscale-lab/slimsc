Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question gives me four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And there are four options (A to D). I need to evaluate each option based on the properties of these matrices and some quantum mechanics concepts.

Let me think about what each of these options is about.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the evolution operator is unitary, which means that e^iH (where H is Hermitian) is unitary. But wait, the exponential here is e^X, not e^{iX}. So what's X like? I should check if X is Hermitian or not.

Matrix X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

I need to find X's conjugate transpose (X†) and see if it equals X.

Computing X†:
The (1,1) element becomes the (1,1) of X's conjugate. The original (1,1) is i, so conjugate is -i. So X†[1][1] is -i.

(1,2) in X is -1, so X†[2][1] is -1 (since it's the conjugate, which is same for real numbers). 

(1,3) in X is 2i; conjugate is -2i. So X†[3][1] = -2i.

Similarly, (2,1) in X is 1, so X†[1][2] = 1.

(2,2) is 0, stays 0.

(2,3) is 1, so X†[3][2] =1.

(3,1) in X is 2i, so X†[1][3] is -2i.

(3,2) is -1, so X†[2][3] is -1.

(3,3) is -i, so X†[3][3] is i.

Putting it all together, X† is:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: 2i, -1, i

Comparing to X:
X is:
Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2: 1, 0, 1
Row3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is not equal to X. So X is not Hermitian. So e^X would not necessarily be unitary.

Wait, but the question is about whether multiplying a vector by e^X changes its norm. The norm change depends on whether e^X is unitary. Because if U is unitary, then Uv has the same norm as v. So if e^X isn't unitary, then applying it would change the norm.

So for option A, if X is not Hermitian, then e^X is not unitary. So there exists a vector (in fact, all vectors) where the norm changes. So option A would be correct. But wait, I need to think again because maybe X is skew-Hermitian. Because for skew-Hermitian matrices, e^X is unitary.

Wait, a matrix X is skew-Hermitian if X† = -X. Let's check that.

Is X† equal to -X?

Let me compute -X:

-X would be:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2: -1, 0, -1
Row3: -2i, 1, i

Compare to X†:

X† is:
