Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complicated, but I'll try to think through it step by step. So the question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that's a mix of acids and a base, so I guess I need to figure out the net acid or base after mixing.

Let me jot down what each solution is. The first is 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which I know is a weak acid. Then 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, a strong acid. And 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base because Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely.

Wait, so when you mix an acid and a base, they'll neutralize each other. But since there are two acids and one base, I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH−, subtract to see which is in excess, and then find the pH based on that.

First, I should calculate the moles for each component.

Let's start with the acetic acid. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.1 M in 0.5 liters. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but I'll handle that later when considering the neutralization.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. 0.2 M in 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. Each HCl gives one H+ ion, so 0.08 H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. The volume is 0.3 L, so moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09. Wait, wait, no: 0.3 M is the concentration. So wait, 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH−, so total OH− is 0.18 moles.

Wait, but what about the H+ from HCl and acetic acid? The HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H+, and the acetic acid would contribute some H+ as well, but since it's a weak acid, maybe I should calculate it as a contribution during neutralization.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by treating all the acids and the base together.

So, the idea is to find out the excess H+ or OH- after mixing all solutions. Let's calculate the total H+ and OH−.

Total H+ comes from HCl and the ionization of CH3COOH. But wait, since HCl is a strong acid, its H+ is fully available. However, acetic acid only partially ionizes. But since we're mixing it with a base, maybe the acetic acid will react with the OH− from the base.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH− from each solution, then see the net.

Wait, but the Ba(OH)2 will
