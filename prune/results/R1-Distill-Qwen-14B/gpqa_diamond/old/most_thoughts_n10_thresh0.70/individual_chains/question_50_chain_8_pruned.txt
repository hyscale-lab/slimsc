Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, my colleague is working on a new theory, and there's this scribbled note next to a diagram. The note has a bunch of constants multiplied together, and I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on that.

Wait, right, in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process. Each loop typically adds a certain factor. Oh yeah, I remember that loop integrals contribute factors of 1/(16π²) per loop in four dimensions because of the integration over the loop momentum. But wait, the exact factors might depend on the specific terms and renormalization procedures.

Looking at the expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me parse each term.

Alpha (α) is the fine-structure constant, which is e²/(4πε₀ħc) or something like that. g is probably a coupling constant, maybe from a gauge interaction or something else. The sqrt(2) and 8 are just numerical factors, so maybe they come from group theory factors or combinatorial factors in the diagram.

The key part here is the 1/(4π)^6 term. Each loop in four dimensions would typically contribute a 1/(16π²) factor. Wait, because integrating over the loop momentum in four dimensions gives a logarithmic divergence, and dimensional regularization often introduces factors of 1/(16π²) per loop for each Feynman diagram's loop integral. So, if we have N loops, the 1/(16π²)^N factor would emerge. But here, the term is 1/(4π)^6. Let me think: 4π to the sixth power is (4π)^6 = (4^6)*(π^6) = 4096 * π^6.

Wait, 16 is 4 squared, so 16π² is (4π)^2. So each loop gives a factor of 1/(4π)^2. So for N loops, it would be 1/(4π)^{2N}.

In the given expression, the denominator is (4π)^6. So 2N = 6 → N=
