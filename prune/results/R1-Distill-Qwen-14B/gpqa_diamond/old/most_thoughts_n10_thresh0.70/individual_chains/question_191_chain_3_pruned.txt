Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (OCH2OH?), wait no, hydroxymethyl would be CH2OH. And at position 5, it's prop-1-en-2-yl, which I think is an allyl group. Oh wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2 but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2 where the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So it's an allyl group attached at position 5 of the cyclohexanone ring.

So the molecule looks something like a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (cyclohexan-1-one), a hydroxymethyl group on carbon 3, and an allyl group on carbon 5.

The first step is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate things. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, so I think an alkylation is happening here.

Looking at the starting molecule, where could the deprotonation occur? Sodium hydride would deprotonate a proton that's acidic. The hydroxymethyl group has an -OH which is somewhat acidic, but maybe more so when deprotonated to an alkoxide. So the OH on the hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) is probably getting deprotonated by NaH to form O-.

Once we have the alkoxide, it's a good nucleophile. Then benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) is added. The benzyl group would attack the oxygen, leading to an alkylation. So the CH2OH group becomes CH2OPhCH2. Wait, no, let me think. The structure is R-O- + PhCH2Br → R-O-PhCH2 plus Br-.

Wait, no, when you have an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide, it's an SN2 reaction. So the O- would attack the benzyl bromide, which is a primary alkyl halide, so SN2 is feasible. This would give the benzyl group attached to the oxygen. So the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) becomes CH2OPhCH2Br after alkylation? No, wait, no, the product would be CH2O-PCH2, but in this case, the oxygen would have two substituents now: the cyclohexane ring and the benzyl group.

Wait, the starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), which after deprotonation becomes CH2O-. Then, when benzyl bromide is added, it would form a new ether bond: the oxygen is connected to both the cyclohexane and the benzyl group (PhCH2). So the structure would become CH2O-PhCH2 connected to the cyclohexanone ring. Or wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me draw this:

Original structure: at position 3 of cyclohexanone, we have CH2OH. Deprotonate with NaH to get CH2O-. Then benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) would react with this, so the O- attacks the benzyl carbon, resulting in O-PhCH2 as the new group. So the hydroxymethyl is replaced by a benzyl ether? No, wait, no, because the hydroxymethyl is CH2-OH, which upon deprotonation becomes CH2-O-. Then when it attacks benzyl bromide, the product becomes CH2-O-PhCH2. Wait, but benzyl bromide is Ph-CH2Br. Wait, no, benzyl bromide is actually (Ph)CH2Br. So the structure is such that the benzyl group is Ph-CH2-.

So when the oxygen attacks, it would be O- + Ph-CH2-Br → O-Ph-CH2- plus Br-.

Wait, but that would make the group OPhCH2. So the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether. So the product 1 would have a group OCH2Ph attached at position 3 of the cyclohexanone ring.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm mixing up the substituents. Let me think again. The starting molecule has a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) at position 3. After deprotonation, it's CH2O^- which attacks the benzyl bromide (Ph-CH2-Br). So the oxygen gets a benzyl group: so the substituent becomes CH2-O-Ph-CH2? No, no, wait, the benzyl bromide is Ph-CH2-Br. So when the O- attacks, the benzyl group (Ph-CH2-) attaches to the O, giving O-Ph-CH2-. So the oxygen is connected to the cyclohexane ring and to the benzyl group (Ph-CH2-). So the substituent is OCH2Ph.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the starting hydroxymethyl as CH2OH, and after alkylation becomes CH2-O-Ph-CH2? Wait, that's not right. Let me think about the reaction.

The reaction is between the alkoxide (O-) and the benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br). The benzyl bromide is a primary alkyl halide, so the O- will attack the benzyl carbon in an SN2 reaction. So the
