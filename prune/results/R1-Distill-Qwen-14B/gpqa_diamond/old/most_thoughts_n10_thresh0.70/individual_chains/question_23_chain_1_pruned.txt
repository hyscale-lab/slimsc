Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when a specific compound reacts with hydrogen bromide. Let me read the question again carefully.

The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, the main part is a benzene ring with an ether substituent. The ether group is O connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if I number from the oxygen), but wait, butenyl is four carbons: positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at carbon 3. Let me draw that.

So, the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, the butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, meaning the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think. The butenyl group is four carbons. For 3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but that might not make sense because butenyl is four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm numbering wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-benzene? No, wait: the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the substituent is O attached to the butenyl. The butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl.

So the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH? No, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, not that. Wait, the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is 3-en-1-yl, meaning the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the substituent is O-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-CH2? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So, the group is O-(CH2)2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is:

The substituent is O attached to a butenyl group where the double bond is between carbons 2 and
