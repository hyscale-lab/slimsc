Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that an organic chemist does two reactions, I and II. Then the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. We need to find out how many peaks each will show.

First, I'll break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one is a ketone at position 3. Reduction would add two hydrogens, turning the carbonyl into an alcohol group.

The starting material is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Wait, no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2CH2... Wait, hexan-3-one would be something like:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methoxy group on the 5th carbon. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3-CH3? So position 3 is the carbonyl.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe I should draw it properly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is: CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, hexane is six carbons. So position 3 is the third carbon. So structure would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2- is that correct? Let me correct that.

Actually, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait,
