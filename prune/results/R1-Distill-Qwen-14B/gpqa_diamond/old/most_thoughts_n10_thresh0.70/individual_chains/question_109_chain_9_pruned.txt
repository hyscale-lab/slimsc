Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and partial waves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum, right? So the equation T = S + L +1 (mod 2) probably means that their parities combine in a certain way.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on angular momentum and parity conservation.

The options are all of the form 1S0 -> something + particle. So the initial state is 1S0, and the decay emits a particle X (like p, s, f, etc., which I think correspond to the orbital angular momentum l=1,0,3? Wait, no, lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. So p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait the letters are s, p, d, f, which denote l=0,1,2,3, etc. So in the options, the terms after the arrow are the final state and the orbital angular momentum of X.

So each option shows the emission of X as part of a partial wave. For example, option A is 7D1 + p: so the X has l=1 (p orbital), and the NN state is in 7D1. Wait, no, the notation after the arrow is the NN state and the particle X. Or wait, the way it's written is like the initial state is 1S0, and it decays to something plus a particle X. So the final state of the NN is given, and the emitted particle X has a certain angular momentum.

Wait, the term after the arrow is "something + particle". So the something is the NN state, and the particle is X. So the problem is about the NN emitting X, so the NN's state must change.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So the NN is in a state with S=0, L=0, J=0 (since 1S0 is 2S+1=1, so S=0, L=0, J=0). Then, after emitting X, the final NN state has certain quantum numbers, and X has some angular momentum.

The problem states that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, because the NN system is being considered
