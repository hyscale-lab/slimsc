Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two planets. The first one has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, the second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The question is about finding the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, and the second one is also in a circular orbit.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit (pass in front of the star from our point of view), its orbital plane must be aligned so that it passes in front of the star. The transit depth depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the impact parameter affects how close to the center of the star the planet passes. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

Oh wait, the key here is probably about the Hill sphere or maybe the Roche limit? Or maybe it's about the condition where the planet's orbit allows it to both transit and be occulted (eclipsed by the star). Wait, occultation would happen when the planet passes behind the star from our view, right?

Wait, actually, occultation for the planet would mean that the planet is behind the star, so the star eclipses the planet. For the planet to be occulted, the planet's orbit must be such that it can pass behind the star. That would require the planet to be within a certain distance from the star so that when it's on the opposite side, it's hidden.

But wait, transiting planets require that their orbital plane is edge-on from our line of sight. So both planets must have their orbits aligned edge-on for transits. Since they share the same orbital plane, both will transit. But the second planet can't be too far because if it's too far, maybe it doesn't get occulted?

Wait, no, occultation is when the planet is behind the star. So the planet would be in the opposite position from where it's transiting. So for that to happen, the planet must orbit the star in such a way that it can be directly opposite the direction of the transit. But I'm
