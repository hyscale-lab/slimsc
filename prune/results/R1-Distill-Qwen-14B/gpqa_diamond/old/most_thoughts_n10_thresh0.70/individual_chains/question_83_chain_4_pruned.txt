Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 is 40.

Wait, what's the concentration after dilution? I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20) / 40 = (1) /40? Wait no, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, 20 divided by 40 is 0.5, so 0.05 * 0.5 is 0.025 M. Yeah, that's right. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me break it down into the two parts: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach that point.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity * Volume. The volume is in liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) gives 0.001 moles. Wait, no: 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L.
