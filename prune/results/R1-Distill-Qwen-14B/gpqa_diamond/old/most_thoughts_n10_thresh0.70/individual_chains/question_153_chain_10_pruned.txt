Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of an enolate and then adding to another carbonyl. But wait, let me think more clearly.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's an enolate. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor. In the Michael reaction, the enolate attacks the beta position of the acceptor. 

So, dimethyl malonate (CH2(COOEt)2) has two ester groups. When the enolate forms, the attack will occur on the beta carbon of the acrylate. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position (the CH2 part), we'll get addition. But wait, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) adds to the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl's beta carbon. So the acceptor is the (E)-acrylate, which has the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. The enolate would attack the middle CH2, which is the beta carbon relative to the carbonyl.

After the attack, the product would form a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would be a new ester. Let me try to imagine the structure. The acrylate has a double bond between C1 and C2, with C3 being the p-tolyl group. The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack C2. So, the product would have the malonate's two ester groups attached to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, dimethyl malon
