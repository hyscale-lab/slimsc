Okay, so I have this chemistry question about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound does not show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options given are combinations of these two answers.

First, let's tackle part A. The compounds in question are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which of these doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different forms by the movement of a hydrogen atom and the reorganization of double bonds. For example, in carbonyl compounds, enols and keto forms can tautomerize. But wait, when does tautomerism occur?

Benzoquinone: I recall that quinones are cyclic di-ketones. Benzoquinone specifically has two ketone groups. Let me visualize its structure. It's a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions (1,4 positions). So the structure is like O=C6H4-C=O.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So it's like O=C-C-C=O-C-C=O in a ring.

Now, can these compounds undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism usually involves adjacent double bonds or something that can shift. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, but each ketone is on a benzene ring. For tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. But wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is R2C=O. If the R groups have hydrogens, those can potentially tautomerize.

Wait, but in benzoquinone, each ketone is attached directly to the benzene. So the carbonyl groups are at the para positions. So each is like Ar-C=O. Are there any adjacent hydrogens? Let me think. The benzene ring is connected to the carbonyl. So each carbonyl group is a (Ph)CO group. The adjacent carbon is part of the benzene ring, which is spÂ² hybridized. So the carbonyl is at the end of the chain. Does that mean there's no adjacent hydrogen for tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen from a position adjacent to a carbonyl group. So if the carbonyl is at the end, like in a ketone that's Ar-CO-R, and R is something without hydrogens adjacent, then maybe no tautomerism.

But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on adjacent carbons. So the ring has alternating single and double bonds? Wait, no, because the trione has three ketone groups. Wait, wait: 1,3,5-trione on a cyclohexane. So each of those positions has a carbonyl group. So the structure is a
