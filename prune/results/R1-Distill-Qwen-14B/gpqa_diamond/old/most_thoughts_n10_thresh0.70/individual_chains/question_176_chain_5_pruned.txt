Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves states, operators, and probabilities of measuring specific outcomes. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a second, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, right, I should probably normalize it first. Let me calculate the norm. The vector is [-1, 2, 1], so the squared magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual state vector is each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector Ïˆ is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, there are two operators, P and Q. I need to find the probabilities of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q, when measuring P first and then Q. Wait, no, the question says after measuring Q, but no, wait the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the measurement order is P first, then Q.

Wait, no, the question says the measurement is P followed by Q. So first, measure P, then measure Q. So I need the outcome probabilities for P=0 and then Q=-1.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable (operator), the state collapses into an eigenstate of that operator. So when you measure P first
