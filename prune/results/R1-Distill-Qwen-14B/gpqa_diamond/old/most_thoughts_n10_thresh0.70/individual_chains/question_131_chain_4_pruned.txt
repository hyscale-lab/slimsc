Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about an organic chemistry reaction and the resulting NMR spectra. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down step by step.

So, the starting point is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR peaks. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products. Both products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. The major product's NOESY spectrum has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by that cross-peak.

First, let's think about the structure of the anhydride. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That region is typically aromatic or maybe an alpha proton. But wait, anhydrides can have carbonyl groups, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: if the anhydride comes from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride.

Wait, the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is likely a carbonyl, maybe the anhydride's carbonyl. 137 could be a carbon adjacent to a double bond or maybe a vinyl carbon. Oh wait, in the dehydrated product, the cis-alkene becomes part of a ring? Or maybe the anhydride has a conjugated system with an alkene.

Wait, the 1H NMR of the anhydride only has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a bit odd. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with equivalent protons, but more likely, it's a conjugated diene or part of a cyclic structure where all protons are equivalent. Alternatively,
