Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that oscillating charges produce electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated at a certain angle and the form of the function f, which depends on lambda and theta.

The setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis, which probably means the radiation pattern will have some specific angular dependence.

The problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. The maximum power is A, and they're asking what fraction of A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also the form of f.

Wait, the options are all pairs: fractions like 1/2, 1/4, etc., and the other part being lambda^-4, lambda^-3, etc. So I need to figure out both the fraction and the dependence on lambda.

I think the first part is about the angular dependence. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is typically a function of cos(theta), I believe. Wait, no, maybe an oscillating dipole. Oh right, the radiation from a dipole varies with (sin theta)^2, so it's maximum at theta = 90 degrees. But this is a spheroid, maybe a different kind of dipole or a quadrupole? Or wait, spheroid could imply some kind of spherical symmetry but perturbed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says the charge distribution is oscillating, so it's an oscillating dipole? Or maybe a higher multipole. Hmm, but the radiation pattern for a dipole is different from a quadrupole.

Wait, let me think. For an oscillating electric dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone
