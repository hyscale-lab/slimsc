Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

So the question is about a mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it forms a new mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Also, both X and Y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%, which is a solvent and doesn't react further. Also, X has no conjugated multiple bonds.

Wait, I think I need to break this down step by step.

First, the mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That suggests that X has compounds with double bonds, like alkenes or maybe some conjugated dienes. But wait, the question says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So, the decolorization might be due to isolated double bonds, maybe. Because conjugated dienes are more reactive, but since X's compounds don't have conjugated multiple bonds, perhaps they have isolated double bonds, which can still react with bromine.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. And Y is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, what reactions cause that? Disproportionation usually involves a species being both oxidized and reduced. For example, in some redox reactions where a single element undergoes both oxidation and reduction. Like in the case of H2O2 decomposing, but wait, maybe something else.

Wait, when alkenes are hydrogenated, they add hydrogen across the double bond. But if X is a mixture that upon hydrogenation with platinum gives Z, then X must be a di-substituted alkene or similar. Wait, but wait, X is treated with platinum and heated to form Y, which is a mixture of two liquids. Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it doesn't have double bonds anymore, maybe all are single bonds.

Wait, maybe X is a di-substituted alkene that upon hydrogenation gives
