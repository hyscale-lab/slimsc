Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the setup: two planets orbiting a star. We're given the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature. Each planet has its own mass and radius. They used both transit and radial velocity methods to detect them. Interesting that both have circular orbits.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25, but I'm a bit hazy on the exact expression.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where A is the albedo. Since the question says they have the same albedo, that part drops out of the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, no, because if you have T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So T1/T2
