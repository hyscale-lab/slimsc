Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what value the algorithm gives for the input ACAGTGACC based on the examples provided. The examples are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I think I should look for a pattern or a rule that the algorithm is applying to the DNA sequences. DNA is made up of four nucleotides: A, T, C, G. Each has a specific weight or value maybe? Let's check the examples.

The first example is AGG -> 115. So, let's see what each nucleotide's contribution might be. AGG has three nucleotides: A, G, G. So, if each has a certain value, adding them up should give 115.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate the sum for each possibility. Let's assume each nucleotide has a specific numerical value. Maybe A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4? Let's test that.

For AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. So 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115, which is way higher. So that can't be right. Maybe it's multiplied by a certain number?

Alternatively, perhaps the algorithm is treating each nucleotide as a digit in a base higher than 10. Wait, but base 4 would be too low considering the outputs. Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide corresponds to a letter with an ASCII value or something like that. Let me think about ASCII codes. A is 65, T is 84, C is 67, G is 71.

Wait, but if I sum the ASCII codes for AGG: 65 (A) + 71 (G) + 71 (G) = 65 +71 is 136, plus another 71 is 207. That's not 115. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Another thought: perhaps each nucleotide is assigned a single-digit number, and the output is the sum plus some multiplier. Let's think of the first example again. AGG gives 115.

Wait, AGG has three letters. So 115 divided by
