Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound shows the expected peaks except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So, the integral is correct, which suggests it's not like an impurity because the integrals add up. They ruled out spin-spin coupling as the cause because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So, maybe something else is causing the double peak.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. So, same mass, which suggests it's not a fragment or a different molecular ion. Since the MS is same, it's not a different compound, but maybe isomers or something else.

Let me look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different molecular weight, right? Because the precursor in a peptide synthesis is usually the previous stage. So, in that case, the mass would be different. But the question says both peaks have the same mass, so probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In NMR, for a chiral compound, if it's a racemic mixture, the protons that are split due to coupling to neighboring chiral centers can show splitting. Wait, but in this case, the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. If the compound is a racemic mixture, the alpha-protons in each enantiomer might experience slightly different environments. But in an NMR, if the molecule is chiral and not in a chiral environment, the protons might not split. Unless the coupling is to another proton. Alternatively, maybe it's about diastereotopic protons. Wait, but the integrals are equal and add to 1H. Wait, if the molecule is a racemic mix, each enantiomer would have the same number of protons. But in NMR, racemic mixtures might not split the peaks because the environments are identical for each proton. Hmm, but if the molecule is not chiral, but the environment is, maybe. Or perhaps if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, the protons might be equivalent. But wait, in a racemic mixture, the two enantiomers might have the same chemical shift because they're mirror images. So that wouldn't cause two peaks for the same proton. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means here. Maybe it refers to a situation where two different bonds form, leading to some isomerization? Or perhaps some kind of coupling that leads to more than one product. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of two stereoisomers. Wait, but the question says the NMR shows two peaks from the same alpha proton. So
