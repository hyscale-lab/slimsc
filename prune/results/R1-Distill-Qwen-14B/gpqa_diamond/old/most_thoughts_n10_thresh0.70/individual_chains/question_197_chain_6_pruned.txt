Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests there's either an -OH group (maybe a carboxylic acid or alcohol) or an NH stretch, but since there's no NMR data for NH protons, it's probably an -OH. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Then, the peaks at around 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data now. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's probably an -OH proton, maybe in a carboxylic acid. Because if it were an alcohol, the proton would usually be around 1-5 ppm. So this makes me think it's a carboxylic acid. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which is common in carboxylic acids.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets with two protons each suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Like, maybe two substituents opposite each other on the ring. So if the substituents are in the para positions, each set of protons would be a doublet. So the substituents could be attached in a para fashion.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for one proton. That could be a CH group adjacent to something else, maybe next to an oxygen or a carbonyl group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for two protons. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl or part of a substituent.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating for three protons. That's a CH3 group attached to something which splits into a doublet. Like a CH(CH3) group where the CH is split by an adjacent group. Or maybe a benzyl group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for three protons. That's usually a CH2CH2CH3 group, so maybe an ethyl chain at the end.

Putting this together, the NMR suggests a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group, probably a carboxylic acid because of the IR and NMR data. Then, there's another substituent which is an alkyl group attached to the ring. Let me think about the structure.

The 10.5 ppm peak is the carboxylic acid -OH. So the carbonyl is at 1720, which fits a carboxylic acid (they usually have higher wavenumber, around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹). The substituents in the para positions are a -COOH group and another group. Let me think what the other group could be.

Looking at the other NMR signals: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) and 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be part of a propyl chain. Wait, 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a triplet if it was adjacent to a CH2, but here it's a doublet. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group. Let me try to draw this.

If the benzene ring has a -COOH group at one para position, the other substituent could be a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something. Wait, let me think again. Looking at the substituent's NMR: there’s a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe the substituent is a butyl group? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl chain. The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let me think: the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2- group attached to the ring, but where's the branching?

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent on the benzene. Maybe it's -CH2CH(CH3)2. But wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. So perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Let me try to imagine the structure: a para-substituted benzene with a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Hmm, not sure. Let me think of the substituents.

Another approach: the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is a strong peak, so perhaps it's a ketone or an ester. Wait, but the -OH at 10.5 ppm suggests it's a carboxylic acid. So the carbonyl is from the COOH group. Then, the other substituent is an alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR again: the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH group that's part of a substituent attached to the ring. The 1.7 ppm is 2H, maybe CH2 connected to that CH. The 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH (doublet because it's adjacent to a CH which has two other substituents, perhaps). The 0.9 ppm is another CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, that seems too long.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (1H, m) → maybe a CH connected to another CH2 and a benzene.

- 1.7 ppm (2H, m) → perhaps a CH2 next to a carbonyl, or
