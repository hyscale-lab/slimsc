Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. The question gives four options, each with possible products A and B. I'll tackle each reaction one by one, starting with reaction A.

Reaction A is: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, okay. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this sounds like an enolate formation reaction. The starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. 

So, when a ketone reacts with a base like t-BuOK, it typically deprotonates to form an enolate. The enolate then attacks an electrophilic position, maybe in another molecule. Wait, but wait, ethyl acrylate is the other reagent here. I think ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which can undergo a conjugate addition, also known as Michael addition. Or wait, is it the enolate attacking the acrylate? Or is the acrylate acting as the electrophile?

Wait, let's think. The starting material is a cyclic ketone. When treated with a strong base, it'll form an enolate. The enolate can then attack an electrophilic carbon. But wait, ethyl acrylate has a carbonyl group and a double bond. So, perhaps the enolate from the cyclohexanone will attack the acrylate in a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, maybe the acrylate is the Michael acceptor, and the enolate is the nucleophile that attacks it. But wait, the ketone is forming the enolate, which is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So the enolate would attack the alpha position of the acrylate? Or wait, the acrylate has
