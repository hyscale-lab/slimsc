Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy is E_n = (n² pi² ħ²) / (2mL²). Oh wait, the problem says E is given as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_1 is E*(1²)=E, E_2 is E*(2²)=4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

But wait, the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. Since they're fermions, each must have a unique quantum state.

In a 1D box, each particle has a quantum number n, which is a positive integer (1,2,3,...). The spin is 1/2, so each particle can have spin up or down. But since they're in the same potential well, their spatial wavefunction must be antisymmetric if their spin part is symmetric, and vice versa. However, for the ground state, I think the spatial part would be symmetric or anti-symmetric depending on the number of particles and their spins.

Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully. For identical particles, the total wavefunction is a product of the spatial part and the spin part. And the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two particles.

Let me think about the ground state first. Since we have four particles, each with spin 1/2. Spin can be either up or down. So for four particles, we need to figure out how to arrange their spin and spatial states to minimize the total energy. The lowest energy configuration would have the lowest possible spatial states.

In a 1D box, each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins. Because each n can have two spin states: up and down. So for n=1, two particles can occupy it (spin up and down). Similarly, n=2 can hold two particles, and so on.

So with four particles, all being spin-1/2, how do they fill up the lowest energy states?

In the ground state, the lowest energy is achieved by having as many particles as possible in the lowest energy levels. Each level can hold two particles (since spin up and spin down). So:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down)
n=2: two particles (spin up and down)

So the ground state configuration would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Thus, the total energy is E_1 * 2 + E_2 * 2.

Wait, each particle's energy is E_n, so for two particles in n=1, their energy is 2*(1² E) = 2E. Similarly, two particles in n=2 contribute 2*(4E) =8E. So total energy is 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again because I might be making a mistake here. Each particle's energy is E_n, so each of the two n=1 particles contributes E, so two together contribute 2E. Similarly, two n=2 particles contribute 2 *4E=8E. So total is 10E.

But looking at the options, option B has 4E, 10E, 50E. Option C is 4E, 10E,15E. Hmm. So the ground state would be 10E. But wait, wait, wait. No, wait a second. I'm confusing the total energy with the individual states.

Wait, perhaps each level can hold two particles because of spin, so the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the energies would be E_1 (n=1) and E_2 (n=2). So the sum is E*(1² + 1² + 2² + 2²) = E*(1 +1 +4 +4)= 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. That's the same as I thought before.

But wait, let me think again. Since each n can hold two particles, the first two particles go into n=1 with spins up and down. The next two go into n=2, each with spins up and down. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Now, what about the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible configuration where the energy is the smallest possible higher than the ground state. Since the ground state filled n=1 and n=2, the next available is n=3.

But I have to think about how the particles are arranged. Let me think about how the particles fill the states. So in the ground state, n=1 has two particles, n=2 has two. Now, for the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves to a higher energy level.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the ground state is the lowest possible, and the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. Let me think about it. So, the first excited state would involve the next available energy level. So perhaps the configuration is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (1 particle), and n=3 (1 particle). Or another arrangement.

Wait, no. Wait, in the ground state, all the lowest possible n's are filled with maximum possible particles (in this case, two each). So to get the first excited state, perhaps the next possible configuration is when one particle from n=2 moves to n=3.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: Each energy level E_n can hold two particles (with opposite spins). So the ground state uses n=1 and n=2 completely filled. So when we go to the first excited state, perhaps another particle goes into n=3, but since all four particles are already placed, how?

Wait, no, wait. The four particles are all in the ground state configuration. So to get the first excited state, perhaps two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but in that case, the total energy would be 2*(E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E. That's an option in option C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has two particles in n=1, one in n=2 (spin up), and one in n=2 (spin down). Wait, but n=2 can only hold two particles. So the ground state has two in n=2, and two in n=1. So the first excited state must have one particle promoted from n=2 to a higher level.

But wait, that might not be possible because all the lower levels are filled. So to get an excited state, more particles would have to be in higher n's. So perhaps, in the first excited state, one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and another to n=3, but wait, no, because each n can hold two particles.

Wait, maybe the first excited state would have two in n=1, two in n=3. But no, because that would require moving two particles from n=2 to n=3. Each could go to n=3, but each requires a spin state. Wait, but n=3 can hold two particles.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state has two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So that would be 2*(1²)E + 1*(2²)E +1*(3²)E = 2E +4E +9E=15E. But that's the sum I was thinking earlier.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and two in n=3. Because n=2 is lower than n=3, so moving two from n=2 to n=3 would result in higher energy. But wait, but in the ground state, n=2 is filled. So perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but then n=2 has only one particle, and n=3 has one. But that would mean the energy is higher than the ground state.

Wait, but wait, the ground state is when all the lowest possible n's are filled. So perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and two in n=2, but that's the same as the ground state. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in thinking that the ground state is when all the lowest n's are filled. Let me consider that perhaps the particles can be arranged in different ways. For four particles, each with spin 1/2, each n can hold two particles. So the ground state is four particles in the two lowest n's: two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1²)E + 2*(2²)E= 2E+8E=10E.

Then, the first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, n=1 has two, n=2 has one, and n=3 has one. So the total energy is 2E +4E + 9E=15E.

Wait, but that's not possible because each n can hold two. So perhaps in the first excited state, two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E. So the first excited state would have energy 15E.

Then, what's the second excited state? It would be when another particle is promoted to a higher n. So perhaps two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2*(1²)E + 2*(3²)E = 2E + 18E=20E. But wait, that's not an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 30E, 39E, 50E

Option B)4E, 10E,50E

Option C)4E, 10E,15E

Option D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, the option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, I thought the first excited state would have energy 15E, and the second excited might be 20E, but that's not an option. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's, but maybe the way they are filled is different.

Wait, another approach: The ground state for four fermions would have the lowest possible n's, each with unique quantum numbers considering spin.

In a 1D box, each energy level can hold two particles (spin up and down). So four particles would fill n=1 (two), n=2 (two), giving a total energy of 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8=10E.

So ground state is 10E. Now, the first excited state would be when the two particles in n=2 move to higher n's. So perhaps two in n=1 and two in n=3. But then the energy would be 2*1 + 2*9=2 +18=20E. But 20E isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=4. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 1 in n=4. But wait, that's five particles, and we only have four. So no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, leaving n=2 with one particle, and n=3 with one. So the total energy would be 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 =2 +4 +9=15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but n=2 can't have more than two. So n=2 would have two, n=3 would have two. So the energies would be 2*1 + 2*9=2 +18=20E. But again, 20E isn't an option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So 10E is ground state, 15E is first excited, and 18E is second excited.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

Then the second excited state could be when two particles are in n=1, two in n=3. So that's 2*1 + 2*9=2+18=20E. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the second excited state is when the next available level is filled. Let me think about the possible energies for the first few states.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: perhaps when the next available level is filled. So maybe two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. But that would be 2*1 +1*4 +1*16=2+4+16=22E. That's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, and another to n=4. So configuration: two in n=1, none in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. Wait, but n=2 can hold two particles, so perhaps that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when the third particle is in n=3. Let me try this again.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider the possible states and their energies.

Wait, perhaps each particle has a unique set of quantum numbers. Since spin is 1/2, each can have spin up or down. So for four particles, we need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy levels without overlapping.

The first two particles go into n=1 with spins up and down.

The next two particles go into n=2 with spins up and down. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E +8E=10E. So ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would involve promoting one of the particles from n=2 to the next available level, n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) = 15E.

The second excited state would then involve promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, making two particles in n=3. So n=1 has two, n=2 has zero, and n=3 has two. Wait, but wait, n=2 can still hold two particles, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would require more energy. So 2E + 4E + 9E + 16E, but that's five particles. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So we have two in n=1, and two in n=3. The energy would be 2*(1² E) + 2*(3² E)=2E + 18E=20E. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So the second excited state is 18E.

Hmm. How do we get 18E? Well, 18E is 3² E *2. Because two particles in n=3: 2*9E=18E.

So perhaps the second excited state has two particles in n=1, two in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +18E=20E. But that's not matching option D.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle moves to n=4, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. So energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So 2*4E +2*9E=8E+18E=26E. Not an option.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Let's list all the possible configurations and their energies.

Ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. Energy=10E.

First excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy=2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: perhaps two in n=1, two in n=3. Energy=2E + 18E=20E.

But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=4. So energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's four particles, so that's 2+4+9+16=31E, which isn't an option either.

Wait, but the options don't have 20E or 31E. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the particles are filled.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Pauli exclusion principle more carefully. Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, which includes n and spin. So for each n, you can have two particles (spin up and down). So with four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), the next two go into n=2 (opposite spins), giving the ground state energy of 10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to a higher energy level. So perhaps two in n=1, two in n=2. But that's the same as the ground state. So maybe that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the configuration is (n=1, spin up), (n=1, spin down), (n=2, spin up), (n=3, spin down). Wait, but n=2 can hold two spins, so perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3. So the configuration would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, leading to energy 15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3. So two in n=1, none in n=2, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 18E=20E.

But that's not an option, so perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, another angle: perhaps each particle's energy is considered individually, and the total is the sum. The ground state is when their energies are as low as possible.

So, the four particles would have the lowest possible n's, which are 1, 1, 2, 2. So their energies are E, E, 4E,4E. Sum is 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So the configuration is 1,1,2,3. The energies are E, E,4E,9E. Sum is 15E.

Second excited state: another n=2 or n=3 particle moves up. If another n=2 moves to n=3, we have 1,1,3,3. Their energies: E, E,9E,9E. Sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

Again, not matching the options. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E.

So the second excited state is 18E. How to get 18E.

Wait, 18E is 9E*2, so two particles in n=3, each contributing 9E, so 18E.

So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3.

But in that case, the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. So total energy is 2E + 18E=20E. But that's not the same as 18E.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and the other two are in higher levels. Or perhaps only two particles are in higher levels.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the second excited state is when another is in n=4. So the energies would be E, E,4E,9E,16E. But wait, that's five particles, so not applicable here.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the possible options and see which ones fit.

The options:

Option D) 10E,15E,18E.

So ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So 10E is two in n=1, two in n=2. That's correct.

First excited state is 15E, which could be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Second excited state is 18E: that's two in n=3. So total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) =20E. But that's not 18E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is two in n=2 and two in n=3. So energy is 8E (n=2) + 18E (n=3) =26E, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state has a different configuration. Let me think differently. Maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=4. But that would be higher energy. So 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) +16E (n=4) = 31E. That's for four particles, but that's way higher than the options given.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The problem says: the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So perhaps the way the particles are arranged in these states is such that each excited state has the next possible energy.

Another approach: For four fermions, the ground state is when they occupy the lowest available n's with their spin states. So n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles) → 10E.

First excited state: perhaps the first particle is promoted to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3, and one in n=2. So the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (two). The energy would be 2E +4E + 2*(9E)=2+4+18=24E. Not matching any option.

Wait, but option D's second excited state is 18E. So how to get 18E.

Wait, 18E is 2*9E, so two particles in n=3. So perhaps that's the case. So in the second excited state, two are in n=3, but how?

So the configuration would be: two in n=1, none in n=2, two in n=3. So the energy is 2E + 18E=20E. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (two), n=3 (two). So 2E + 2*(9E) =20E.

But 20E isn't in the options. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and the other two are in n=3. That would make the energy 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. But that's higher than the first excited state I thought earlier (15E).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the order of the states. Let me list the possible energy levels in order.

The possible energies for each particle are:

n=1: E

n=2:4E

n=3:9E

n=4:16E

n=5:25E

etc.

The ground state is when the four particles are at the two lowest n's, which are n=1 and n=2. So that's 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves up. So possible options are:

- One particle in n=3, and the rest in n=1 and n=2. So configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves up. So perhaps two in n=3, one in n=2, and one in n=1. Sum is 2E +4E + 2*(9E)=2E +4E +18E=24E.

But none of the options have 24E. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So sum is 8E (n=2) +18E (n=3) =26E.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves to n=3, but another moves to n=4. So sum is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E, but that's for four particles.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the options again.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So the second excited state must have a total energy of 18E. How?

18E can be achieved by two particles in n=3, each contributing 9E, so 2*9E=18E. So that would mean the configuration is two in n=3 and two elsewhere.

But where? Maybe two in n=1 and two in n=3. So 2E +18E=20E. But that's not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is one in n=2, one in n=3, and two in n=4. But that would sum to 4E +9E + 2*(16E) =4 +9 +32=45E, which is higher than 18E.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is two in n=2 and two in n=3. So 8E + 18E=26E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible energies.

Ground state:10E.

First excited state:15E.

Second excited state:18E.

How to get 18E.

18E = 3² * E * 2 = 2*9E=18E.

So perhaps the configuration is two in n=3 and two in a higher level.

Wait, but that would require four particles, so two in n=3 and two in n=4, for example. 2*9E +2*16E=18E +32E=50E. That's option A's third option.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is two in n=3 and the other two in n=1. So energy is 2E +18E=20E.

But that doesn't match 18E.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energies are calculated as the sum of the individual energies of each particle. So for four particles, their individual n's could be:

Ground state: 1,1,2,2 → sum 1+1+4+4=10E.

First excited state:1,1,2,3 → sum 1+1+4+9=15E.

Second excited state:1,2,3,3 → sum 1+4 +9+9=23E.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is 2,2,3,3 → sum 4+4+9+9=26E.

Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the particles are arranged as 1,1,3,3. Sum is 1+1+9+9=20E.

Hmm.

But the option D has the second excited state as 18E. How?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and the other two are in n=0. No, n starts at 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and none in n=2. So the sum is 2E (n=1) +18E (n=3) =20E.

But that's not 18E.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. So sum is 4E + 18E=22E.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for the option that matches the possible energies.

Looking back, the options are:

A)30E,39E,50E → sum of 1+4+9+16=30? No, because 1+4=5, 9+16=25 → 5+25=30. But that would be four particles in n=1,2,3,4. So 1+4+9+16=30E. So ground state is when all are in higher n's. No, that's not the ground state.

Option B:4E,10E,50E. So ground state is 4E. But that would imply all four particles are in n=2, but n=1 can hold two, so that's impossible. So option B's ground state is likely incorrect.

Option C:4E,10E,15E. Ground state would be 4E. But that's impossible because two particles can be in n=1 (sum 2E), and two in n=2 (sum 8E). So total is 10E. So option C's ground state is 4E, which doesn't make sense. So option C is incorrect.

Option D:10E,15E,18E. Ground state is 10E, which makes sense. First excited state is 15E, which aligns with our earlier thought. Second excited state is 18E, which I'm not sure how to achieve. But perhaps 18E is for two particles in n=3 and two in a higher n. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. So sum is 2*(9E) + 2*(16E) = 18E +32E=50E. Which is option A's third state.

But the question is asking for the second excited state, not the third. So perhaps option D is the correct one, with the second excited state being 18E, which I'm not exactly sure how to get, but perhaps it's when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (two), n=3 (two). So sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But that's not in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The only option where the ground state is 10E is option D. So perhaps that's correct.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E (two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3), and the second excited state is 18E, which would be two in n=3 and two in n=4? No, because that would be higher than 18E.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when the configuration is two in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum is 2E +18E=20E. But that's not 18E.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck here. Given the options, the only one where the ground state makes sense (10E) is option D. So perhaps the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 18E, which would be two particles in n=3 and two in n=2. So 2*(4E) + 2*(9E)=8E +18E=26E. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So 2*4E +2*9E=8E+18E=26E. Again, not matching option D's 18E.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and second excited is 18E. So option D is correct.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well
The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E,
\]

where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Each energy level \( n \) can accommodate two particles due to the two possible spin states (spin-up and spin-down).

### Ground State
In the ground state, the four particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. Since each level can hold two particles:
- Two particles occupy \( n = 1 \),
- Two particles occupy \( n = 2 \).

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n = 1 \),
- One particle in \( n = 2 \),
- One particle in \( n = 3 \).

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2E) + (2^2E) + (3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n = 1 \),
- Zero particles in \( n = 2 \),
- Two particles in \( n = 3 \).

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

However, none of the options provided match this result. Upon reviewing the options, the only one consistent with the ground state energy \( 10E \) and the first excited state energy \( 15E \) is **Option D**. While the reasoning for the second excited state energy \( 18E \) is unclear, it is plausible that the problem assumes a different configuration or approximation for the second excited state.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: \( 30E, 39E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state energy is inconsistent with the calculated \( 10E \).
- **Option B**: \( 4E, 10E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state energy \( 4E \) does not match the calculated \( 10E \).
- **Option C**: \( 4E, 10E, 15E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state energy \( 4E \) does not match the calculated \( 10E \).
- **Option D**: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \) — Correct, as it matches the calculated ground state \( 10E \) and first excited state \( 15E \), and \( 18E \) is likely an approximation for the second excited state.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
