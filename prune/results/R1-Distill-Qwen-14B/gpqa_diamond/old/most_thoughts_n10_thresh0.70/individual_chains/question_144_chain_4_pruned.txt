Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. They give me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various values in meters.

Wait, meson resonances... Oh right, mesons are bosons, usually made of a quark and antiquark. Their decay distances depend on their lifetimes. But wait, the mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So I think the formula involves the lifetime of the particle and its velocity.

The formula for mean decay length should be L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Right? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

So I need to find tau first. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime. I remember that the uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ / tau. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, units! Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. I need to convert that into something compatible with time.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? Let me think.
