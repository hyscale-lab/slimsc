Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let me try to think this through.

The spins are S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to consider all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate the energy for each, then sum the exponentials.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe I can find a smarter way than enumerating all 8.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's call this sum S for simplicity. So E = -J * S.

So for each state, S can take certain values, and each S corresponds to a certain number of states (microstates). So I can group the states by their S values and compute how many states give each S.

Let me find all possible values of S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. But wait, no. Wait, because S_i and S_j are each +/-1, so their product is also +/-1. So each term contributes either +1 or -1. So the sum S can range between -3 and +3, in steps of 2, maybe?

Wait, let's think. Each S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, how? Let me think of all possible numbers of +1s and -1s in the three terms.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about all possible spin configurations.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that S can be expressed in terms of the sum of the spins. But I'm not sure. Another approach: consider that S is the sum of all the pairwise products.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding (S1 + S2 + S3)^2
