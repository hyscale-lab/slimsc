Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis mechanisms can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with benzene. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First step: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. Oh right, that's a nitration reaction. Nitration adds a nitro group. Benzene is nitrated under these conditions, so product 1 is nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta director.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene with nitrating mixture gives nitrobenzene, but the position depends on the directing group. In nitrobenzene, the nitro group is a meta director. Oh wait, but wait, no. Nitration of benzene adds the nitro group at a position. But wait, benzene itself is symmetric, so the product is a single isomerâ€”nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Second step: product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Iron and Br2 is a bromination condition. But wait, nitrobenzene is a meta director. So the bromine will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, but nitrobenzene is
