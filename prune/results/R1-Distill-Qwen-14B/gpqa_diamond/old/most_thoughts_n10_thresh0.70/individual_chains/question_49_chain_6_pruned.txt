Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has three reactions, and I need to find the correct products A, B, and C, then choose the option that matches all three.

First, let me recall what sigmatropic rearrangements are. They're a type of pericyclic reaction where a sigma bond moves, shifting a pi bond between positions. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, and they typically happen under thermal conditions.

Looking at the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat → A

Hmm. So, the reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, but adding H+ and heat—so maybe an acid-catalyzed reaction. I think this could be a case of Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but wait, the starting material isn't a diene or something like that.

Wait, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is a compound with two methoxy groups on a nitrogen. Maybe it's a structure like OMe2N-CH2-CH3? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be NH(OCH3)2CH2CH3? Or is it (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether or something else, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but the other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure: CH2CH2CH(OH)–CH2? Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, buten-2-ol. Let me correct. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, but that's 3-en-2-ol, which is correct. So structure is CH2=CH–CH(OH)–CH3.

Wait, but when you have an enol (but-3-en-2-ol), and you have an amine with two methoxy groups, maybe they're undergoing some kind of condensation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-like rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility. The amine has two methoxy groups attached to the nitrogen, and when acid is added, maybe it forms an iminium ion or something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an enamine.

Wait, wait. Maybe the amine is acting as a base, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the two reactants are combining in a way that forms a ketal or acetal, but that's more common with carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the but-3-en-2-ol is undergoing an acid-catalyzed dehydration to
