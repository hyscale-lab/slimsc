Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are each 1, which makes sense for p orbitals. The total l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Hmm. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1, since it's a p orbital. So their individual Lz eigenvalues would be mħ, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

But in the coupled state, the total angular momentum is described by l=2 and m=-1. So, when we measure L1z and L2z, their individual m values (m1 and m2) add up to the total m, which is -1.

Wait, the total m is m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that add up to -1 would be: (0, -1), (1, -2), but wait, m can't be less than -l, so for each particle, m can only be -1, 0, +1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1
m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1
m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can't be less than -1. So that's not possible.

So the only possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). 

But wait, the question is asking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L_z eigenvalue is mħ. So if both are measured as -ħ, that would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, but wait, m1 + m2 would be -2, which doesn't match the total m = -1 of the state. So that's a problem.

So if the total m is -1, the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. But if both are -1, their sum is -2, which isn't possible under the given state. Therefore, the state |l=2, m=-1> doesn't include any component where m1 = m2 = -1. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. The state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. To find the probability, I need to expand this state in terms of the product states |m1, m2>, right?

The coupled state |l, m> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m. For l=2 and m=-1, the possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1) since their sum is -1. There are no other possibilities because m1 and m2 can't be outside their allowed ranges.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a linear combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1> ?

Wait, no, because the total l is 2, which is l1 + l2 = 1+1=2. So the possible m1 and m2 are such that m1 + m2 = -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. But each product state must have m1 and m2 within their individual ranges (-1 ≤ m1 ≤ 1 and -1 ≤ m2 ≤ 1).

So the possible product states are |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So the coupled state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of these two product states. But how? There's a formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients here.

Wait
