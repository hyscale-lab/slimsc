Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics because that doesn't account for relativity correctly. Oh right, Einstein's theory of relativity comes into play here.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Wait, but wait, relative to what? Oh, I think the problem states they're moving in the positive x-direction, so I guess both are moving in the same direction. So, the first astronaut has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, and the second is 3m at 0.5c.

The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, the relative speed. In classical mechanics, relative speed is just the difference in velocities. So if two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference. But wait, that's only at low speeds. At relativistic speeds, you can't do that because the speeds add differently. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. I think it's (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the formula. Alternatively, I remember that when you have two velocities, you use the velocity addition formula from relativity.

Wait, let me think. So if astronaut A is moving at v1 = 0.6c, and astronaut B at v2 = 0.5c, both in the same direction, then their relative speed should be from B's frame, how fast A is moving. So if B is moving at 0.5c, then in B's frame, A's speed would be (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute that.

The numerator becomes 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Next, the total energy of the system. Wait, total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. Each has a rest mass and is moving at a relativistic speed, so their energies are gamma times m c squared.

So for astronaut 1 (2m mass), his gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). His v is 0.6c, so (v^2/c^2) is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma
