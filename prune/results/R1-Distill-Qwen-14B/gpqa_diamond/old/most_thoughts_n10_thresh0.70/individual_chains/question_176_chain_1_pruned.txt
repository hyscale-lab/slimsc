Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. The initial state of the system is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait a second, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, which are normalized. So the state here must be normalized. Let me check the length.

The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm would be sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the vector's length is sqrt(6), which means it's not normalized yet. So the actual state is probably this vector divided by sqrt(6). That makes sense because in quantum states, the vectors are normalized, so the state vector should have a length of 1. So the state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Alright, moving on. The problem says first we're measuring P, then Q. Wait, no, the question is about measuring Q just after P. So the sequence is first P, then Q. But we're looking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the order of measurements matters because measuring one observable affects the state for the next measurement.

So, the process is: measure P, get outcome 0, then measure Q on the resulting state, get outcome -1. The probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 in P and then getting -1 in Q given that P was 0. Alternatively, since P and Q are observables, each with their own eigenstates, perhaps we can find the combined probability by considering the state after the first measurement.

Wait, but I'm not sure if P and Q share the same eigenbasis. Since the matrices are different, their eigenstates might be different. So perhaps the state after measuring P is an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q in that state.

Alternatively, perhaps the measurement of P first, then Q, is done in the same state without any collapse? No, because when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the state after measuring P will be the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of P, and then Q is measured on that state.
