Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and the form of f.

So, the options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a lambda dependence.

Alright, first, I remember that when a dipole radiates, the power pattern has a certain dependence. For an oscillating dipole, the radiation is stronger along the axis perpendicular to the dipole's oscillation. Wait, the dipole here is along the z-axis because of the symmetry. So the dipole is oscillating along z.

In dipole radiation, the intensity goes as sin^2(theta), where theta is the angle from the dipole's axis. So the maximum intensity is when theta is 90 degrees, I think. But wait, the problem is about the power per unit solid angle, which is the radiation pattern or the directional intensity.

Wait, so the power per unit solid angle is given by f(lambda, theta). For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone) is something I need to recall. The intensity or the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta), right? That's the standard result. So at theta = 90 degrees, it's maximum, and at 0 and 180, it's zero. So the maximum power is A, so at theta=30 degrees, what's the fraction.

Wait, if the maximum is at theta=90, then that's when sin(theta)=1, so sin^2(theta)=1. So for theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin^2(theta)=0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25, which is 1/4. Oh wait, but waitâ€”wait, the maximum is A. So the power at theta=30 is (1/4) A? Or is the maximum A, so the fraction is 1/4.

Hmm, but let me think again. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So if f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta), then the
