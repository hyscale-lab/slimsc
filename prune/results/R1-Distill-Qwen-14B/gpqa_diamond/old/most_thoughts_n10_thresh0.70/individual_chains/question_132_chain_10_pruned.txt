Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both have the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. We're given four options, each pair of compounds, and we need to choose which pair is present.

So, the first thing I'm thinking is about the molecular formula. Both compounds are C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for that. The formula is C10H14. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogens, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So that's four degrees of unsaturation, which could mean a benzene ring (which counts as three, since it's one ring and three double bonds) plus one more double bond or ring. But wait, since both are aromatic, probably each has a benzene ring. So each has a benzene ring (3 degrees) and one more, perhaps a methyl group attached in a way that doesn't introduce another ring, but maybe a substituent like an ethyl group but wait, let me think.

Wait, the molecular formula C10H14. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 4 carbons. Because 6 (benzene) + 4 (substituents) = 10. Each substituent would contribute to the number of H. Let's think: each substituent is probably a methyl group. Because if you have four methyl groups (each is -CH3), that adds 4*3=12 H, but benzene has 5 H when substituted. Wait, wait, let me clarify. Benzene has 6 H in the ring. Each substituent is a methyl group. If you have four methyl groups on the benzene, then each would take up a position, replacing an H. So, for the ring, if it's a para-substituted benzene, but wait, maybe it's a di-substituted or tetra-substituted.

Wait, but in the options, each compound is a tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Option C: 1,2,3,5 and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

Wait, so each of the first three options has two tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has one tetramethyl and one diethyl.

Wait, but diethyl would be C2H5 groups. Let's check the molecular formula.

1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups on the benzene. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls add 4 carbons (2*2) and 10 hydrogens (each ethyl has 5 H). Benzene is 6 C, so total is 6 +4=10 C, which matches. Hydrogens: benzene has 4 H if it's 1,4-diethyl? Wait, wait, benzene normally has 6 H. Each ethyl group is attached to the ring, so each takes one
