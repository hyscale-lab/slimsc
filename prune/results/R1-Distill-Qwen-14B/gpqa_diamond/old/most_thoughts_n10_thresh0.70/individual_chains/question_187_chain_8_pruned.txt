Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method. But wait, the question is about detectability based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).

The question says a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of these stars meet that criterion.

Looking at the options provided (a to f), each has different characteristics. Let me list them out:

a) Canopus – I know Canopus is a very bright star. It's one of the brightest in the sky, so it should be easily detectable.

b) Polaris – Polaris is also a bright star, the North Star. It's magnitude-wise probably around 2, but I'm not exactly sure. Either way, it's pretty bright, so probably detectable.

c) A star with V mag 15 at 10 pc. Wait, let me think. Absolute magnitude (M) is about how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So if it's at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude (m) would be M + (distance modulus). The distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10) where d is in parsecs. For 10 pc, that's 5 log(1) = 0. So apparent magnitude m = 15 + 0 =15.

Wait, but how does apparent magnitude relate to detectability? Brighter stars (lower m) are easier to get high S/N. The fainter the star (higher m), the lower the S/N because fewer photons are reaching the detector.

So, for a star with m=15
