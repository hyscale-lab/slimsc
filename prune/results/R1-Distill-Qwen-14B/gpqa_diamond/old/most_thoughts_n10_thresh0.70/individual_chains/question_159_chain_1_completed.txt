Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically looking at the near infrared and optical spectrum. The question is about determining the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth based on certain cosmological parameters. Hmm, I need to think this through step by step.

First, the question states that there's a peak at about 790 nm (which is near infrared) and that the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths (optical). I remember that when quasars have emission lines, their observed wavelengths can be redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. So this peak might correspond to a specific emission line, like Lyman alpha or something else.

Wait, I think the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, around 121 nm. But if the observed wavelength is in the infrared, that would mean a significant redshift. Let me think, the rest wavelength is about 121 nm, and the observed is 790 nm. So the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. So (790 - 121)/121 is roughly 669/121, which is about 5.5. So z is approximately 5.5.

Then, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a function of the redshift and the cosmological parameters given. The parameters are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωk=0).

I remember that the comoving distance D_C is calculated using an integral involving the scale factor. The formula is something like D_C = (c/H0) * integral from 0 to z of [1/(sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ*(1+z')^{3(1+w)})))] dz'. Wait, what's w for dark energy? Oh, dark energy is usually modeled as a cosmological constant, so w = -1. So the exponent becomes 3(1-1)=0, so Ωλ term is (1+z')^0=1.

So putting it all together, the integrand becomes 1/(sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ)). But wait, the total is Ωm*(1+z')^3 + (1-Ωm), because Ωm + Ωλ = 1 in a flat universe.

So the integral is [1/(sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + (1 - Ωm)))] dz'.

Hmm, and for each redshift z, you integrate from 0 to that z. The comoving distance is then (c/H0) multiplied by that integral.

But wait, I don't remember the exact integral result for these parameters at z=5.5. That seems high. Alternatively, maybe I can use a lookup table or approximation.

Wait, I think for high redshifts, the expansion history is dominated first by matter and then dark energy. But at z=5.5, which is a high redshift, the universe was matter-dominated because dark energy's effect becomes more significant at lower redshifts. Hmm, but actually, let me think: matter density scales as (1+z)^3, while dark energy (as a constant) remains the same. So during high z, matter density was higher, so matter dominated.

Wait, the matter density parameter today is 0.3. But at high z, the matter density increases. So the universe was matter-dominated at high z.

But calculating the integral exactly would require some computation. Alternatively, I might remember that for certain redshifts, the comoving distance can be approximated.

Alternatively, I can think about the age of the universe. Wait, but I'm not sure how that directly relates. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calculator or a formula that approximates the comoving distance for given parameters.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the comoving distance is approximately (c / H0) * f(z), where f(z) is a function that depends on the cosmological parameters and the redshift.

Wait, for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be expressed using the integral I mentioned. But without doing the exact integral, perhaps I can look up approximate values.

Wait, I think that at z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc for H0=70. Wait, no, wait, no, that's not right. Let me think—actually, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, which is about 70 / (10^3 m/s) / (3.086e22 m) ) ≈ 70/(3.086e22 * 1e3) s^-1 Mpc^-1.

Wait, maybe I should just accept that I can't compute the integral exactly here, but perhaps I can think of some standard values or approximate.

Wait, I think that at z=5, the comoving distance is approximately around 10-11 Gpc. Let me see: if z is 5.5, maybe around 11 Gpc. But the options given are 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc. Hmm, that's lower than my initial thought. Maybe I'm mixing up something.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the proper distance or the luminosity distance. No, the question is about comoving distance, which is a sort of "distance" that remains constant after the expansion of the universe. So higher redshift would imply larger comoving distance.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the approximation formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy. I think the formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1 + z')³ + Ωλ)] dz'

But integrating this is not trivial without a calculator. Perhaps I can use an online cosmology calculator. Wait, since I can't do that now, I have to think of other ways.

Another approach: for a matter-dominated universe (Ωm=1, Ωλ=0), the comoving distance is (c/H0) * (2/(3(1 + z)^{3/2}} )) * (sqrt(1 + z) - 1). For high z, this approximates to (c/H0) * (sqrt(z)/(3 H0)) ), but that's probably not helpful here.

But in our case, Ωm=0.3, so it's a mixed universe. So the expansion isn't as rapid as a matter-dominated universe but not as slow as dark-energy dominated.

Wait, the integral I have to compute is ∫0^z [ 1 / sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7) ] dz'

Hmm, maybe I can approximate the integral numerically.

Let me think: if I split the integral into a few parts, maybe using the midpoint rule or trapezoidal rule. But with just a few points, perhaps it's manageable.

Wait, the function is 1/(sqrt(0.3*(1+z')³ + 0.7)).

Let me choose a few z' values between 0 and 5.5 and compute the function f(z').

For z'=0: 1/sqrt(0.3*1 +0.7) = 1/sqrt(1) = 1.

z'=1: 1/sqrt(0.3*(8) +0.7)= 1/sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=1/sqrt(3.1)≈0.56.

z'=2: 0.3*(27)=8.1 → 8.1 + 0.7 =8.8 → sqrt(8.8)≈2.966 → 1/2.966 ≈ 0.337.

z'=3: 0.3*(64)=19.2 +0.7=19.9 → sqrt(19.9)=4.461 → 1/4.461≈0.224.

z'=4: 0.3*(125)=37.5 +0.7=38.2 → sqrt(38.2)=6.18 → 1/6.18≈0.1617.

z'=5: 0.3*(216)=64.8 +0.7=65.5 → sqrt(65.5)=8.093 → 1/8.093≈0.1236.

z'=5.5: 0.3*(5.5^3)=0.3*(166.375)=49.9125 +0.7=50.6125. sqrt(50.6125)=7.114 → 1/7.114≈0.1405.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense. At higher z, the denominator should be larger because both Ωm*(1+z)^3 and Ωλ terms are increasing. Wait, no, because sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ) would increase as z increases. So the integrand (1/sqrt(...)) would decrease as z increases.

Wait, but wait, at z'=5, the integrand is 0.123, and at z'=5.5, it's 0.1405. Hmm, that's an increase, but that can't be right because as z' increases beyond 5, the function's denominator (sqrt(...)) should keep increasing, so the integrand should keep decreasing.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate for z'=5.5.

(1 + 5.5) =6.5. (1+z')^3 = 6.5^3=274.625.

So 0.3 * 274.625=82.3875. Plus 0.7 gives 83.0875.

sqrt(83.0875)=9.115. So 1/9.115≈0.1097.

Ah, okay, I must have miscalculated before. So integrand at z'=5.5 is ~0.1097.

So now, let me tabulate the integrand at several points:

z' | f(z') = 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7)
0 | 1.0
1 | 0.56
2 | 0.337
3 | 0.224
4 | 0.1617
5 | 0.1236
5.5 | 0.1097

Wait, perhaps I can approximate the integral using the trapezoidal rule with these points as a start.

But using the trapezoidal method, the integral from 0 to 5.5 can be approximated with intervals between these points. Let me try to compute it step-wise.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a step of 0.5 and compute more points to get a better approximation.

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can use Simpson's rule with a few intervals. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a simple average.

But perhaps an easier way is to find a reference or recall that at z=5.5, the comoving distance is around 15 Gpc for H0=70. Wait, but the options are up to 9 Gpc. Hmm, that's a problem because if I remember correctly, a higher redshift would imply a larger comoving distance.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the peak's origin. Let me think again. The peak is at 790 nm. Could that be the Lyman break? Wait, the Lyman series in hydrogen has lines that when excited, have rest wavelengths below 91 nm (like Lyman alpha at 121 nm). If the observed wavelength is longer than that, it's either due to redshift or intergalactic medium absorption.

Wait, but if the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, that's much longer than the rest wavelength of Lyman alpha. Let's see: 790 nm is 7900 Å. Lyman alpha is 1216 Å. So (7900/1216) ≈ 6.5, so z≈5.5.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman series, but more likely, the peak is from another emission line, perhaps the Balmer series. For instance, H-alpha has a rest wavelength of about 656 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, the redshift would be (790-656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈0.204, so z≈0.204. But that's a much lower redshift.

Hmm, but the question says that at shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm) the flux drops. So perhaps the peak is at 790 nm, which would be the redshifted version of a rest wavelength. If the rest wavelength is in the optical, say 500 nm, then (790/500) gives z = (790/500) -1 = 0.58. That would be a lower redshift.

Wait, but the problem states that the peak is in the near infrared, which is longer wavelengths. So the emission line is likely to be in the UV or optical when emitted. So Lyman alpha is a possibility, which would give z ≈ 5.5.

But if that's the case, then the comoving distance would be large. Let me think about the options again. The options are 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc. If I'm correct about z=5.5, then the comoving distance is likely larger.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing luminosity distance with comoving distance. Wait, the question asks about the comoving distance for a=1, which is the present scale factor. So the comoving distance is a sort of 'fixed' distance that would be observed today.

Wait, I think another approach is to use the approximation for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy. I remember that the comoving distance can be roughly approximated using:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * (1 + (1 - q0)/2 * (1 + q0/3 * z + ... )) )

But I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe using the age of the universe approximation.

Wait, perhaps I can think about how the comoving distance relates to the age of the universe. The comoving distance is the integral of the scale factor over time, multiplied by the Hubble parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a cosmology calculator or a table of values. But since I can't do that right now, I have to think of another way.

Wait, another thought: the Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc. So, 1/H0 is approximately 14 billion years (since H0 ≈ 70 implies age ≈ 14 Gyr). But wait, 1/H0 in units where c=1 is about 14 billion years.

But perhaps the comoving distance is (c/H0) * integral of 1/E(z) dz, where E(z) is sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3 + Ωλ).

So, with E(z) = sqrt(Ωm (1+z)^3 + Ωλ), and Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7.

At high z, say z=5.5, (1+z)^3 is 6.5^3=274.6. So Ωm*(1+z)^3 = 0.3 * 274.6 ≈ 82.4. Adding Ωλ=0.7 gives E(z) ≈ sqrt(83.1)≈9.116. So 1/E(z)≈0.1097.

But integrating from 0 to z=5.5 is a big task. Maybe it's easier to use a table or an approximate function.

Wait, I think that for high redshifts, the comoving distance can be approximated as D_C ≈ (c/H0) * ( (2/3) (1+z)^{3/2} )^{-1} ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for a standard value. I think that for z=1, the comoving distance is around 2 Gpc for H0=70. For z=5.5, it's much higher. Let me think, I've read before that at z=5, the comoving distance is about 16 Gpc for H0=70. But the options don't go that high. The options are 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc.

Wait, that must mean I'm making a mistake in my approach. Perhaps the peak isn't from Lyman alpha? Let me think again.

If the peak is at 790 nm, which is near infrared, could that be from a different emission line, perhaps the rest wavelength is around 500 nm (green)? Then (790/500)-1=0.58, so z≈0.58. That's a much lower redshift.

But why does the flux drop below 790 nm? That suggests that shorter wavelengths (bluer) are not as bright. If the emission line is at 790 nm, then shorter than that would be blue. But the drop could be due to the quasar's spectrum being featureless in the blue, which could be because of the Lyman limit or other absorption features.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is the Lyman limit absorption, but that's a bit more speculative.

Wait, another thought: could this peak be the redshifted Lyman-alpha emission line? Because Lyman-alpha is in the UV, so if it's redshifted into the near-infrared, that's a high z.

So let's stick with z=5.5. Then, the comoving distance is calculated using the integral.

But according to my earlier rough calculation, the integral from 0 to 5.5 might be around 5.5 * (average of the integrand).

Wait, the integrand starts at 1 when z=0, and decreases to about 0.1097 at z=5.5.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate the integral by taking the average of the values at a few points.

But to get a better approximation, perhaps I can use Simpson's rule with intervals. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a step size of 1 and compute the function at each step, then sum.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the age of the universe. The age of the universe at z=5.5 can be calculated, but I'm not sure how that directly helps with the comoving distance. Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance is roughly (c/H0) times the age at z=5.5, but adjusted for the expansion.

Wait, the age of the universe at redshift z is given by:

t(z) = (1/H0) ∫0^z [1/(E(z'))] dz'

Which is the same integral as the comoving distance divided by c. Because D_C = c/H0 * ∫ [1/E(z')] dz'.

So, D_C = c * t(z) * H0.

Wait, no, because D_C = (c / H0) * ∫ [1/E(z')] dz'.

And t(z) = (1/H0) ∫ [1/E(z')] dz'.

So D_C = c * t(z).

Hmm, that's a useful relationship. So if I can find the age of the universe at z=5.5, multiply by c to get the comoving distance.

But again, without knowing t(z), I can't proceed directly. However, I can approximate t(z) for high z.

Wait, for a matter-dominated universe (Ωm=1), the age is (2/3 H0) (1 + z)^{-3/2} (sqrt(1+z) -1).

But our universe isn't matter-dominated; it's a mix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

I think that for z=5.5, the age of the universe would be roughly a few billion years less than the current age of ~13.8 billion years. But even that is uncertain.

Wait, let me think. The current age is ~13.8 Gyr. At z=5, the universe was younger. How much younger?

An approximate formula for the age of the universe at redshift z in a flat ΛCDM universe is:

t(z) ≈ (1/H0) * [ (2/3) (1+z)^{3/2} ) (sqrt(1+z) -1) ) / (Ωm) ) ]^{-1}.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me recall the correct expression.

The age of the universe is given by:

t(z) = 1/H0 ∫0^z [1/sqrt(Ωm(1+z')³ + Ωλ)] dz'

Which is the same as the integral for the comoving distance divided by c.

So integrating from 0 to 5.5.

But without doing the integral, perhaps I can find an approximate value for t(5.5).

I think that for z=5.5, the age of the universe is about 1.4 billion years. So t(z)≈1.4 Gyr.

Then, D_C = c * t(z) ≈ 3e5 km/s * 1.4e9 yr.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute D_C correctly.

Wait, wait, no: D_C = c * t(z). But t(z) is in seconds, and c is in km/s, so:

t(z) in seconds: 1.4 Gyr = 1.4e9 yr * 3.154e7 s/yr ≈ 4.415e16 s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s.

So D_C = 3e8 m/s * 4.415e16 s = 1.3245e25 m.

Convert to Mpc: 1 Mpc ≈ 3.086e22 m.

So D_C ≈ 1.3245e25 / 3.086e22 ≈ ~429 Mpc.

Wait, that's about 429 Mpc, which is 4.29 Gpc. But that's way lower than the options. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Because 1.4 Gyr would give a much smaller comoving distance than the options provided. So perhaps my assumption about the age is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the age of the universe at z=5.5. Let me try to think again.

In a ΛCDM universe with Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7, the age at z=5.5 is longer than in a matter-dominated universe.

Wait, in a matter-dominated universe, the age at z=5.5 would be (2/3 H0) (1 + z)^{-1/2} (sqrt(1 + z) -1).

Wait, let me compute that.

H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

H0 in s^-1:

H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70e3 m/s / (3.086e22 m) ) ≈ 70e3 / 3.086e22 ≈ 2.266e-19 s^-1.

Wait, but 1/H0 ≈ 4.417e18 s, which is about 14 billion years (1.4e10 years), which matches expectations.

So, for a matter-dominated universe, the age at z=5.5 is:

t_matter = (2/3) (1 + z)^{-3/2} (sqrt(1+z) -1) / H0.

Wait, no, the formula for the age in a matter-dominated universe is:

t_matter(z) = (2/3) * (1 + z)^{-3/2} * (sqrt(1+z) - 1) / H0.

Wait, solving for z=5.5:

sqrt(1+5.5)=sqrt(6.5)=~2.55.

So, t_matter = (2/3) * (6.5)^{-3/2} * (2.55 - 1) / H0.

Compute (6.5)^{-3/2} = 1 / (6.5^1.5) = 1/(sqrt(6.5)*6.5) ) ≈ 1/(2.55 *6.5) ≈ 1/16.575 ≈0.06048.

So,

t_matter = (2/3) * 0.06048 * (1.55) / H0.

Compute 0.06048 *1.55 ≈ 0.0935.

Multiply by 2/3: ~0.0623.

So t_matter ≈ 0.0623 / H0.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, so 0.0623 / (70) ≈ 0.00089.

But wait, H0 is in s^-1, so the time is in seconds?

Wait, no, I think the formula is in terms where H0 is in s^-1, so the t_matter is in seconds.

Wait, let me compute H0 in s^-1.

H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc.

1 Mpc = 3.086e22 meters.

So 70 km/s = 70e3 m/s.

So H0 = 70e3 m/s / 3.086e22 m = 70e3 / 3.086e22 ≈ 2.266e-19 s^-1.

So 1/H0 ≈ 4.417e18 s ≈ 14.0e9 years.

So t_matter = (2/3) * (6.5)^{-3/2} * (sqrt(6.5)-1) * (1/H0).

Compute the coefficient:

(2/3) * (approx 0.06048) * (2.55 -1) = (2/3) * 0.06048 *1.55.

2/3 ≈0.6667.

0.6667 *0.06048 ≈0.0403.

0.0403 *1.55 ≈0.0624.

So t_matter ≈0.0624 * (1/H0) ≈ 0.0624 * 4.417e18 s ≈ 2.757e17 s.

Convert to years:

2.757e17 s / (3.154e7 s/yr) ≈ 8.75e9 years ≈ 8.75 billion years.

Wait, that's the age in a matter-dominated universe. But in our universe, with dark energy, the expansion is faster, so the age at a given redshift is less than in a matter-dominated universe. So our t(z=5.5) should be less than 8.75 Gyr.

But the current age of the universe is about 13.8 Gyr. So at z=5.5, the universe would be 13.8 - 8.75 = 5.05 Gyr old? That doesn't make sense because the age at z=5.5 can't be older than the current age.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the current age is about 13.8 Gyr, and for z=5.5, the age is t(z=5.5) = current age - lookback time.

But I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently.

In a matter-dominated universe, the age at z=5.5 is about 8.75 Gyr. But in our universe, which is dark energy dominated at lower redshifts, the expansion is faster, so the age at a given z should be less than in a matter-dominated universe.

So perhaps in our universe, the age at z=5.5 is about 8 Gyr.

Wait, but that can't be because the current age is 13.8 Gyr. That would imply the lookback time is 5.8 Gyr, making the light from the quasar have been traveling for 5.8 Gyr, which would make the comoving distance about D_C= c * t.

Wait, c is 3e5 km/s, t is 5.8e9 yr.

But let's compute D_C.

t in seconds: 5.8e9 yr * 3.154e7 s/yr ≈ 1.829e17 s.

D_C = c * t = 3e5 km/s * 1.829e17 s.

Wait, that's 3e5 *1.829e17 km = 5.487e22 km.

Convert to Mpc: 1 Mpc ≈ 3.086e19 km.

So D_C = 5.487e22 / 3.086e19 ≈ 1780 Mpc = 1780 / 1e3 = 1.78 Gpc. Hmm, which is 1.78 Gpc, but the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should reconsider the redshift.

Wait, perhaps the peak isn't from Lyman-alpha but from another line. Let me think about other emission lines.

The Balmer series in hydrogen has lines in the optical. For example, H-alpha is at 656 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that would imply a redshift of (790-656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈ 0.204, so z=0.204. That's a much lower redshift.

Wait, but if the peak is at 790 nm and the flux drops below that, perhaps it's due to the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is about 91 nm, so a quasar might have emission lines blueward of that absorbed, but that's more speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman series, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the comoving distance can be calculated using a cosmology calculator. But since I can't do that, I'll have to think of another way.

An alternative is to use the approximation formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

I found a formula in some notes that for a flat universe, the comoving distance can be approximated as:

D_C = (c / H0) * [ (2/3) (1 + z)^{3/2} (sqrt(1 + z) - 1) ) / (Ωm (1 + z)^3 + Ωλ) ) ]^{-1}.

Wait, no, that's not correct. I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I can use a different approach. Let me recall that the comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c / a(t) dt, where a(t) is the scale factor. But given the complexities, perhaps I should look for an approximate value.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options and see which one makes sense.

If the redshift is z=5.5, and the comoving distance is around 15 Gpc for H0=70, but the options don't go that high, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the redshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed peak is in the near-infrared, which is 790 nm. The rest wavelength could be much shorter. If the rest wavelength is, say, 121 nm (Lyman alpha), then z= (790/121)-1≈5.5.

But comoving distance for z=5.5 is higher than the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest wavelength is in the optical, say around 500 nm. Then z= (790/500)-1=0.58. For z=0.58, the comoving distance would be lower.

Wait, let's compute the comoving distance for z=0.58.

Using the same integral:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^0.58 [1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)] dz'

Compute each term:

z'=0: 1/sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1.

z'=0.5: 0.3*(1.5)^3=0.3*3.375=1.0125. 1.0125 +0.7=1.7125. sqrt≈1.309. 1/1.309≈0.764.

z'=0.58: (1.58)^3= 3.944. 0.3 *3.944=1.183. +0.7=1.883. sqrt≈1.372. 1/1.372≈0.729.

Using the trapezoidal rule with intervals 0-0.5 and 0.5-0.58.

Compute the integral:

From 0 to 0.5: (0.5-0) * (1 + 0.764)/2 = 0.5 * 1.764/2 =0.5 *0.882=0.441.

From 0.5 to 0.58: (0.58-0.5) * (0.764 + 0.729)/2 =0.08 * (1.493)/2=0.08 *0.7465≈0.0597.

Total integral≈0.441 +0.0597≈0.5007.

So D_C= (3e5 km/s / 70 km/s/Mpc ) * 0.5007.

3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 0.5007: 4285.7 *0.5007≈2145 Mpc ≈2.145 Gpc.

But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm, that's lower than the options. So perhaps the redshift is higher than 0.58.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from a higher-redshift line. Let me think: if the peak is at 790 nm, and the rest wavelength is 121 nm, z=5.5. But then the comoving distance would be about 15 Gpc, but the options don't go that high.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the cosmological parameters. The matter density is 0.3, dark energy 0.7, flat.

Wait, perhaps using an approximate formula for comoving distance. For a flat universe, the comoving distance can be approximated as:

D_C ≈ (c/H0) * [ (2/3) * (sqrt(Ωm/(Ωm + (1 - Ωm)(1 + z)^3)) ) ) ] * (1 + z)^{-1/2} )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the look-up table values. I think that for a flat ΛCDM model with Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 16 Gpc for H0=70.

But that's higher than all the options given. So perhaps the peak isn't from a high-redshift object.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from a different emission line. Let's think: in quasars, there are emission lines like Lyman alpha (121 nm), He II (164 nm), C IV (155 nm), etc. Another possibility is the Balmer break, which occurs around 400 nm in the rest frame. If the observed peak is in the near infrared (790 nm), that would indicate a redshift of (790/400)-1=0.975, so z≈0.975.

Wait, that's a much lower redshift. Let me compute the comoving distance for z=0.975.

Again, D_C = (c/H0) * ∫0^z [1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7)] dz'.

Compute the integrand at several points:

z'=0:1.

z'=0.5: 0.3*(1.5)^3=1.0125 +0.7=1.7125. sqrt=1.309. 1/1.309≈0.764.

z'=0.975: (1.975)^3≈7.714. 0.3*7.714=2.314. +0.7=3.014. sqrt≈1.736. 1/1.736≈0.576.

Using trapezoidal method for integral from 0 to 0.975.

Divide into intervals of 0.5 and 0.475.

So, from 0 to 0.5: f=0.5*(1 +0.764)=0.882. So the integral part is 0.5 *0.882=0.441.

From 0.5 to 0.975: width=0.475.

At z=0.5, f=0.764. At z=0.975, f=0.576.

The average is (0.764 +0.576)/2=0.67.

So the area is 0.475 *0.67≈0.318.

Total integral≈0.441 +0.318=0.759.

D_C= (3e5 /70 ) * 0.759.

3e5 /70≈4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 0.759: 4285.7 *0.759≈3253 Mpc ≈3.25 Gpc.

But the options are 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc. Hmm, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the peak as being the 912 Angstrom (91.2 nm) Lyman limit. If the observed peak is at 790 nm, then z= (7900/91.2) -1≈86.6-1=85.6.

Wait, that's an enormous redshift, but then the comoving distance would be immense, way beyond the options.

Wait, but perhaps the peak is from the Lyman break, which occurs at around 912 Angstrom. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm (7900 Angstrom), then z= (7900/91.2) -1≈86.6-1=85.56.

But that would make D_C extremely large, which doesn't fit the options.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. The initial assumption about the redshift might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not from an emission line but from the host galaxy's continuum.

Wait, another thought: sometimes quasars show a "big blue bump" in their spectra, which peaks in the UV. But if the observation is in near-infrared, perhaps it's a thermal emission or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the host galaxy's stellar population, which could have a peak in the near-infrared due to older stars. But that's more about the SED of the host, not necessarily the quasar emission.

But the question focuses on the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The flux dropping below 790 nm suggests that at shorter wavelengths, the flux is lower. That's typical for a quasar's emission line, which might be surrounded by an absorption trough.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from an emission line that's redshifted into the near-infrared. So, if the rest wavelength is around 500 nm (green), then z= (790/500)-1=0.58. As before, comoving distance around 2 Gpc, but the options are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is at the Lyman break, which is around 912 Angstrom (91.2 nm). So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, z=(790/0.0912)-1≈8665. So that's z=8664. Which is way too high.

But that's beyond any realistic quasar redshift. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the luminosity distance formula.

The luminosity distance is given by D_L = (1 + z) * D_C.

But the question is about comoving distance, D_C.

Wait, another approach: The flux F is related to the luminosity L by F = L/(4π D_L^2). But I don't have F or L here, so that might not help.

Wait, perhaps the drop-off in flux below 790 nm is due to the Lyman limit. So any photons with wavelength below 91.2 nm (912 Angstrom) are absorbed by the intergalactic medium (like the Gunn-Peterson trough). So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, then the quasar must have a high redshift such that the Lyman limit is at 912 nm*(1+z)= observed wavelength of lower than 790 nm.

Wait, wait, no, let me correct that. The Lyman limit is at 912 Angstrom in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is λ_obs, then the redshift z is (λ_obs - 912)/912.

If the observed wavelength is less than 912*(1+z), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the Lyman limit absorption sets a limit on the observed wavelength. For quasars at high redshifts, the Lyman limit (91.2 nm) is observed at longer wavelengths. So if the quasar's Lyman limit is observed at λ_obs <790 nm, then:

z = (λ_obs /91.2e-9 m) -1.

Wait, but 790 nm is 790e-9 m.

So z= (790e-9 /91.2e-9 ) -1 = (790/91.2) -1 ≈8.66-1=7.66.

So z≈7.66.

That would make sense because the flux drops below 790 nm, indicating that the intergalactic medium has absorbed wavelengths below the Lyman limit.

So if z≈7.66, then the comoving distance can be calculated.

Now, with z≈7.66, let's compute the comoving distance.

Again, using the same integral:

D_C = (c/H0) * ∫0^7.66 [1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7)] dz'.

This integral is for z' up to 7.66.

Hmm, but without numerical computation, it's hard. Let's try to approximate.

At z'=7.66, (1+z')=8.66. (1+z')^3= 8.66^3≈649. So 0.3*649=194.7 +0.7=195.4. sqrt(195.4)=14. So 1/sqrt(...)=~0.0714.

At z'=0: 1.

At z'=5: as before, f=0.1236.

At z'=7.66: f=~0.0714.

But integrating all the way up to 7.66 would give a larger value.

But perhaps using an online calculator would help. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximation.

Wait, I found a source that gives comoving distance for a flat ΛCDM model (Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7) with H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

For example, according to this table: [Imagine I'm recalling from a table]

At z=7, D_C≈15 Gpc.

At z=8, D_C≈17 Gpc.

But our z is 7.66, which is between 7 and 8. So the comoving distance would be around 16 Gpc. But the options don't go that high.

Hmm, but the options are up to 9 Gpc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the redshift calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the peak at 790 nm isn't the Lyman limit but another feature. Maybe it's the Lyman-alpha emission line, so z= (790/121.6)-1≈6.49.

So z≈6.49.

Then, the comoving distance for z=6.49.

Again, using the same integral.

But without exact computation, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate value.

Wait, according to some online sources, for z=6, the comoving distance is about 14 Gpc for H0=70. But the options are up to 9 Gpc. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the peak is not from an emission line but from the host galaxy's continuum, which would have a lower redshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the [O III] emission line, which has a rest wavelength of about 500 nm. Then z=(790/500)-1=0.58, as before.

But then the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. I'm clearly not getting the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the peak is in the near-infrared and the flux drops below it. That could indicate that the quasar's emission is being cut off by the Lyman limit absorption. So the observed peak is just above the Lyman limit.

So, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z).

The Lyman limit is 91.2 nm, so if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is much longer, that would imply a much lower redshift.

Wait, no, wait: the Lyman limit in the rest frame is 91.2 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then:

(1 + z) = 790 /91.2 ≈8.66. So z≈7.66.

Ah, now that makes sense. Because any emission below 91.2 nm (in the quasar's rest frame) would be redshifted beyond 790 nm, which is why the flux drops below 790 nm. So the quasar emits below 91.2 nm, but due to the high redshift, we only see up to 790 nm.

So with z≈7.66, the comoving distance is D_C= (c/H0) * integral from 0 to 7.66 of [1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7}] dz'.

But without computing the integral, perhaps I can estimate D_C.

I think that for z=7.66 in a flat ΛCDM model (Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7), the comoving distance is approximately 15 Gpc for H0=70.

But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. None of these match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral numerically.

Let me try to approximate the integral ∫0^7.66 [1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7)] dz'.

I'll divide the integral into intervals and use the trapezoidal rule.

Compute f(z') at several points:

z'=0 → f=1.

z'=2 → (1+2)^3=27 → 0.3*27=8.1 → 8.1+0.7=8.8 → sqrt(8.8)=2.966 → f≈0.337.

z'=5 → f=0.1236.

z'=7 → (8)^3=512 →0.3*512=153.6 +0.7=154.3 → sqrt(154.3)=12.42 → f≈0.0805.

z'=7.66 → (8.66)^3≈649 →0.3*649=194.7 +0.7=195.4 → sqrt(195.4)=14 → f≈0.0714.

Now, using these points, let's compute the integral.

Divide the interval [0,7.66] into intervals of 2,5,7,7.66.

Compute the width and average for each interval.

From 0 to 2: width=2. f(0)=1, f(2)=0.337. Average=(1+0.337)/2=0.6685. Area=2 *0.6685=1.337.

From 2 to5: width=3. f(2)=0.337, f(5)=0.1236. Average=(0.337 +0.1236)/2=0.2303. Area=3*0.2303≈0.6909.

From 5 to7: width=2. f(5)=0.1236, f(7)=0.0805. Average=(0.1236+0.0805)/2=0.10205. Area=2 *0.10205=0.2041.

From7 to7.66: width=0.66. f(7)=0.0805, f(7.66)=0.0714. Average=(0.0805 +0.0714)/2=0.07595. Area=0.66 *0.07595≈0.0503.

Total integral≈1.337 +0.6909 +0.2041 +0.0503≈2.2823.

So D_C = (3e5 km/s /70 km/s/Mpc) * 2.2823.

Compute 3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 2.2823: 4285.7 * 2.2823 ≈9866 Mpc ≈9.866 Gpc.

So approximately 9.87 Gpc.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 9 Gpc.


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the given observations and cosmological parameters. The quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This suggests the presence of a redshifted emission feature, likely the Lyman limit absorption at 91.2 nm (rest wavelength). The redshift, \( z \), is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{91.2} - 1 \approx 7.66
\]

With \( z \approx 7.66 \), the comoving distance \( D_C \) is computed using the integral:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \, dz'
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), and \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \). The integral is approximated numerically by dividing it into intervals and using the trapezoidal rule. The function \( f(z') = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \) is evaluated at several points:

- \( z' = 0 \): \( f = 1 \)
- \( z' = 2 \): \( f \approx 0.337 \)
- \( z' = 5 \): \( f \approx 0.1236 \)
- \( z' = 7 \): \( f \approx 0.0805 \)
- \( z' = 7.66 \): \( f \approx 0.0714 \)

The integral is divided into intervals, and the area under the curve is approximated. The total integral evaluates to approximately \( 2.2823 \). Substituting into the formula for \( D_C \):

\[
D_C = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \times 2.2823 \approx 9.87 \, \text{Gpc}
\]

This value is closest to the option \( 9 \, \text{Gpc} \). Therefore, the comoving distance of the quasar is approximately \( 9 \, \text{Gpc} \).
