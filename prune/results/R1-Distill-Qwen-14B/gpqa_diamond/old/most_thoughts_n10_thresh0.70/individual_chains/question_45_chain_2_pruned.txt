Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember from my notes that in such a well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. The formula for the energy is E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), right? And they give E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so E is like the base unit of energy here.

Wait, the question is about the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. But wait, these are four identical particles. Oh, wait, identical particles with spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Spin-1/2 means electrons or something similar, so their wavefunction has to be antisymmetric under exchange.

But wait, the potential well is one-dimensional. So the particles are in a 1D box. Each particle's state is described by a quantum number n, and their spin. Since they are spin-1/2, each particle can have spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states, right?

So for four particles, each can occupy a state with a unique combination of n and spin. But the Pauli exclusion principle says that no two particles can have the same quantum state. So each n can have two particles (with opposite spins), but no more.

So the ground state would be the lowest possible energy configuration, then the first excited, and so on.

Let me think about filling the states. The energy levels are E_n = n² E, since E is given as pi² ħ²/(2mL²). So E_1 = 1E, E_2=4E, E_3=9E, E_4=16E, etc.

Now, for four identical fermions, each must have a unique quantum state. So how do we fill these?

For ground state: We need to fill the lowest possible energy levels, each with as many particles as possible without violating the exclusion principle.

Each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So let's see:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: another 2 particles.

But wait, we have four particles. So the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. So all four particles are filled in the first two energy levels.

So the total energy would be the sum of each individual energy multiplied by the number of particles in that state.

Wait, no. Each particle in a state contributes that energy. So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the energy of the ground state would be (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2*1E + 2*4E = 2E +8E = 10E.

Wait wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because when you have four particles, each in their own state, but spin allows two per n.

So n=1 and spin up, n=1 spin down: two particles. n=2 spin up, n=2 spin down: two more. So each n has two, but each particle is in their own state.

So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2 +8 =10E.

But wait, the options have B as 4E, 10E, 50E. So maybe 10E is one of the options.

Wait, but what about the first excited state and second excited? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Are they asking for the energy levels of the system as a whole, considering all four particles, or just the energy of each state (like the energy of a single particle in that state)?

Wait, the question says, "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." Oh, so the system's energy levels are the sum of the individual energies of the four particles in each configuration.

So let's think again. The ground state is when all four particles are in the lowest possible states, which is two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 10E.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think about it differently. For fermions, each state is unique. So each particle has a unique (n
