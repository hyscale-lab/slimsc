Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining straight onto this aperture, and we're looking at the resulting pattern of intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation tan θ ≈ θ.

Hmm, alright. So first, I think about what an aperture like this would do. When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern called the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but here the aperture is a polygon. But when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, no, wait. The question is about when N is infinitely large. So the shape becomes a circle. But wait, no, the apothem is the same for all sides. Wait, what's an apothem? The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is a fixed length. So as N increases, the polygon becomes more like a circle with radius changing based on N.

Wait, wait. For a regular polygon with N sides, the relationship between the apothem a and the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) is a = R * cos(π/N). So as N becomes very large, π/N becomes very small, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²). But as N approaches infinity, a ≈ R, so R ≈ a. So the polygon becomes a circle of radius a. Wait, no, because in the limit, the apothem a would be approximately equal to R, the radius of the circle. So the diameter is 2a.

Wait, but wait. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when the polygon becomes a circle, the radius
