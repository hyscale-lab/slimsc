Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Alright, I remember that electric potential energy between charges is a key concept. Let me try to break this down.

The problem states: We have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C. Got that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where one charge is fixed, and the other twelve are all located 2 meters away from P. So, the arrangement is like a central charge with twelve others equally distant around it, but probably not necessarily in a symmetrical arrangement. But wait, for potential energy, maybe the arrangement doesn't matter because electric potential energy is a scalar quantity.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Wait, but in an isolated system, the potential energy is a measure of the work done to assemble the charges. Since all the charges are identical and of the same sign, bringing them together would require work, so the potential energy would be positive. But wait, the question is about minimum energy. Hmm, if we can choose the configuration that gives the lowest possible potential energy, perhaps the system's minimum energy is when all the charges are as close as possible. But wait, but in this setup, the twelve charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, so perhaps their positions are already determined. Or maybe the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are fixed at 2m away.

Wait, the problem says the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So, the setup is fixed. So, the potential energy is just the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

So, each of the 12 charges at 2m away from P (so each is at 2m from the 13th charge). So, the system consists of the 13th charge at P, and 12 others each at a distance of 2 meters from P.

So
