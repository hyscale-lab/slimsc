Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem gives details about substances A1 to A5, and I need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. I know that when a substance can oxidize xenon, it's probably a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is usually in the +0 oxidation state, so A1 must be able to cause it to go to a higher state, maybe Xe^2+ or something like that.

A2 has an oF (I think that's the oxidation number of fluorine) of 31.96%. Wait, oxidation number is a percentage? Hmm, maybe that's the average oxidation state. Let me think. Fluorine typically has a -1 oxidation state. But sometimes in compounds, especially with more electronegative elements, it can show other states, but usually not. Wait, 31.96% of fluorine's oxidation number might refer to the average. So if fluorine is -1, but wait, 31.96% is a decimal of around 0.3196. Hmm, perhaps the oxidation state is positive? Because if fluorine is being oxidized, that would mean it's acting as a reducing agent. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the oF for A2 is 31.96%. Maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in the compound. No, no, the question says "ɷF=31,96%", which I think is the oxidation state of fluorine. So if the oxidation state is positive, that's unusual for F. Alternatively, perhaps it's the average oxidation number. Let me think, in some compounds, fluorine's oxidation state can be positive, like in certain cases. For example, in O-F bonds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about what A1 could be. A1 is a bright-red substance. I remember that KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent and is dark purple, but not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's MnO2? No, MnO2 is black. Wait, maybe it's something else. Oh! Wait,
