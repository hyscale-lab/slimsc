Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out what X is first, and then determine the product after the reaction.

The data given includes IR and NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that IR is good for functional groups, and NMR gives information about the structure. Let me start by analyzing the IR data.

Looking at the IR peaks: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which might be from aromatic C=C stretching, and 1450 cm-1 could be another aromatic peak or maybe a C-O stretch.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak in 3400–2500. That's typical for an O-H in a carboxylic acid. So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative? Because benzoic acid has both a carbonyl and a carboxylic O-H.

Now, let's look at the 1H NMR. The most downfield region is 10.5 ppm, which is a sharp singlet or broad. That's probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are typical of para-substituted aromatic protons. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. The 8.0 ppm is more deshielded, so maybe a substituent is electron-withdrawing, which would make the adjacent protons more downfield. Like a carbonyl group attached to the ring.

So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene, probably with a carbonyl group attached. That would make sense because the 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent in the para position.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, like maybe a CH next to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two protons next to a CH group. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, like maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like from an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and an ethyl group attached to a CH2-CH(CH3)2 or something similar. Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, let me think. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 at the end. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for two protons, which might be a CH2 next to a CH. The 1.4 ppm is a triplet of a CH3 attached to a CH. So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, maybe it's a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent might be a propyl group attached to the ring. Or perhaps it's a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, let me think about the substituent
