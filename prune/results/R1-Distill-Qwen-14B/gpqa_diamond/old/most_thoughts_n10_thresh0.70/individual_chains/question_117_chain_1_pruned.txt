Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about which organic compounds show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when compounds have chiral centers, meaning they lack a plane of symmetry and can't be superimposed on their mirror image. So, these compounds would have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. Chiral centers are typically carbons bonded to four different groups.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's look at each one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
Hmm. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond, right? The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The molecule has two nitro groups (NO2) on each benzene ring, but wait, no, wait. Let me parse that. It's 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro at position 6. And 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a carboxylate at position 2. And each carboxylate is a methyl ester.

So the structure has two benzene rings connected in a biphenyl structure. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Now, for biphenyl compounds, the substituents can lead to different isomerism. If the substituents are in certain positions, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry or not. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable with its mirror image, then it can have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the molecule itself is symmetrical, such as if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it might not be chiral.

Wait, in this case, each ring has the same substituents: nitro at 6 and ester at 2. But wait, in a biphenyl system, the substituents can have different arrangements. Let me visualize this. Each benzene ring has the nitro and ester groups. The positions 2 and 6 on each ring are across from each other. So on each ring, the substituents are opposite each other. But when the two rings are connected, does the overall molecule have a plane of symmetry?

If the substituents on each ring are mirror images, maybe the whole molecule is symmetrical. Alternatively, if the arrangement leads to different groups on the same carbon, making it a chiral center.

Wait, wait, but biphenyl systems can have different types of isomerism, like cis and trans. Oh, wait no, that's for double bonds. For biphenyls, the arrangement around the single bond can lead to different isomers, but whether they're optical or not depends on symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule itself has a chiral center. Wait, wait. The central carbon? No, in this case, the central bond is between two benzene rings, each with substituents. Are there any chiral centers here? Let me check.

Looking at each ring: each ring is attached to the central bond. For each ring, the substituents are on opposite positions (2 and 6). So on each benzene ring, the substituents are on opposite sides. Wait, but the central bond is a single bond. So the two rings can rotate around that bond, but in some cases, when substituents are in certain positions, the molecule can't rotate to look the same as its mirror image, leading to cis or trans isomerism, but those are geometric isomerism, not optical.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism based on chirality. So I'm a bit confused. Does this biphenyl system have any chiral centers? Let me think.

Wait, the central atom is a single bond between two carbons, but each is part of a benzene ring. So the central atoms are not chiral centers because they are each part of a ring structure. So maybe the molecule itself doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, perhaps the substituents create a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, the substituents are nitro and ester groups on the benzene rings. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at position 6
