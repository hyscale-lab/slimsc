Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question involves several reaction steps and then an NMR analysis. I'll need to think about each step carefully.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so its structure is quite rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

Step one: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—wait, are those carbons adjacent? No, because 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh, wait, adamantane's structure is such that the 1,3 positions are probably on opposite faces, but they are on the same ring. Hmm, maybe it's a 1,3-dibromo structure on a four-membered ring?

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four fused cyclohexane-like rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead carbons. When treated with KOH, perhaps elimination occurs. But wait, for elimination, the bromines need to be on adjacent carbons. But 1,3 positions are not adjacent. Hmm. Wait, actually, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are on the same bridge. Let me visualize adamantane: it's a four cyclohexane rings fused together. The bridgehead positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait, I think 1 and 3 are across a bridge, so maybe they are not adjacent. So, can't eliminate to form a double bond? Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a case of debromination. But if two bromines are present, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation but with two separate eliminations.

Wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination, but in this case, perhaps each bromine is on a bridgehead
