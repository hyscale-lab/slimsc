Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics and magnetic fields. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term in a magnetic field to the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm. Right, paramagnetism has to do with electrons responding to a magnetic field, I think. The magnetic field here is along the Oz axis, which I believe is the z-axis. And m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can be -1, 0, or +1 for p orbitals, but wait, no, m depends on the orbital type. For example, s orbitals have m=0, p can be -1, 0, +1, etc. But the question says m is small, so maybe m=0 or 1.

Wait, the problem states that m is small, so we can probably treat it as m=0, but I'm not entirely sure. No, wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be from -l to +l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. For example, in a hydrogen atom, the ground state is 1s, so l=0, so m=0. If it's 2p, l=1, m can be -1,0, +1. But the problem doesn't specify which state we're in, just that m is small. Maybe we can proceed without knowing the exact m.

The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla, which I know is a strong magnetic field but not super high. The question is about the paramagnetic coupling term compared to the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen with a given wavelength.

Wait, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? Oh right, in the presence of a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian has a term called the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor. Wait, but I think for an electron, the magnetic moment is μ = -g_s μ_B m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing orbital and spin here. Oh, the paramagnetic effect usually comes from the spin, but sometimes orbital contributions can be considered. Hmm, but the question specifies the paramagnetic coupling term, so I think it's the spin-orbit coupling, but wait no, wait, paramagnetism is due to spin, right? So the paramagnetic term would be the spin Zeeman term.

Wait, but the actual term in the Hamiltonian is due to the magnetic interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external field. For an electron, the magnetic moment is μ = -g_s (eħ)/(2m_e) * S, where g_s is the Landé g-factor, approximately 2. So the energy is H = -μ·B.

But wait, when B is along Oz, then H is H = -μ_z B. Which becomes H = g_s (μ_B) m_s B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, no, wait: The spin magnetic moment is μ = g_s (μ_B) m_s, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and B is the magnetic field. So the energy is H = -μ·B = -g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but the question says it's the paramagnetic coupling term. So I think that's the spin term. So the matrix element would be H = g_s μ_B m_s B. But wait, I'm supposed to find the expectation value of H, which is ⟨H⟩. For an electron in a spin state with magnetic quantum number m_s, this expectation value is just g_s μ_B m_s B.

Alternatively, wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * l, so the energy is H_orbital = -μ_orbital · B = -(μ_0 μ_B) l_z B. But I'm not entirely sure if that's relevant here, since the question mentions the paramagnetic coupling term, which is about spin. So perhaps it's the spin term.

Wait, but wait, the orbital term would be part of the Zeeman effect, but paramagnetism is specifically about the spin contribution. So I think the term we're looking at is the spin Zeeman term.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term would be ⟨H⟩ = g_s μ_B m_s B.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given for hydrogen with a wavelength of 0.4861 μm. That's the Balmer series, right? Because 0.486 μm is about 486 nm, which is the Balmer-alpha line (H-alpha), corresponding to a transition between n=3 and n=2.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So, let
