Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question asks which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices given are A to D, each corresponding to one of these. Let me try to parse each option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Hmm, Earth's density is known. Since it's similar to Earth, I think Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have the same density as Earth. So option a has 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but isn't density an independent property? Oh wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, density is mass divided by volume. So if a planet has a certain mass and a certain radius, its density can be calculated. But in option b, it's given that the density is 5.5, so that's the value. So the planet has 2 Earth masses but 5.5 density. That's the same as Earth's density, which would imply a larger volume. Because if mass increases but density is same, volume must increase. Because density = mass/volume. So if mass is 2 Earth masses, and density same as Earth (5.5), then volume would be 2 times Earth's volume. Wait, but Earth's volume is (4/3)πr³, so if radius increases, how? Hmm, maybe not important here. But for option b, the density is given as 5.5, so that's same as Earth's. So its density is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Wait, same composition, so same density. Because density depends on composition. So if it's same composition, same density. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet also has 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Again, same composition, same density. So density is 5.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me check that
