Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The absorption happens at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. Hmm.

I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for hydrogen. But when a cloud is moving away from us, it would cause a redshift in the absorbed light. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms. 

Wait, but optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So, for the absorption line to be visible in the optical range, the redshifted wavelength must fall into the optical part of the spectrum. That makes sense.

So, I think the idea is to find the redshift z such that the Lyman-alpha wavelength, when redshifted, is just at the start of the optical range observable by ground telescopes. Wait, but what's the optical range? I think optical is roughly 400-700 nm, but wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far-ultraviolet. So for it to be observed in the optical, the observed wavelength after redshift needs to be in the 400-700 nm range. Let me check the units.

Wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So the observed wavelength lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). I need lambda_observed to be >= 400 nm (since anything below that is UV, which ground telescopes can't see). 

Wait no, wait. The clouds are in front of quasars. The quasar emits light, and the hydrogen clouds absorb the light at Lyman-alpha. So the quasar's light is in the optical, but the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is UV. But when the cloud is at a high redshift, the absorption line would be redshifted into the optical
