Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r and time t. The setup is a point charge q moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the fields at a later time when t > tr, where tr is the time when the field was generated. Oh wait, and d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, that's the retarded position vector, I think.

So, the velocity of the charge at the generating time tr is v. I remember that potentials are usually expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity. Wait, the scalar potential is straightforward—like Coulomb's law, but maybe adjusted for some motion.

Wait, the scalar potential V is given by (1/(4πε₀)) * q / r, but wait, isn't r the distance from the charge to the observation point at the retarded time? Or is it the distance at the current time? Hmm, but in the static case, like when the charge isn't moving, V is just q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance now. But when the charge is moving, do we use the retarded distance?

Wait, no, wait. The potentials in electrodynamics usually depend on the retarded time. So, the scalar potential V(r
