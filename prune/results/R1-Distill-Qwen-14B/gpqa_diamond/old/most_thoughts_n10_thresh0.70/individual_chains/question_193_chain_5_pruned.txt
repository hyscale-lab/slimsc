Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the equation is something like N ∝ 1/plx^5, where N is the number of stars. 

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So if d increases, plx decreases. 

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of distance, not parallax. Let me think. Since plx = 1/d, I can substitute that into the equation. 

So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1 over that would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5? Hmm, wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm getting the exponents right. 

Wait, N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). And plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so maybe it's about the density or the rate of change. Hmm. Wait, the number of stars per unit volume, or per some other measure.

Wait, no. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So I think it's the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr. So it's the number as a function of r. 

If N ∝ d^5, then for a thin shell, the number of stars would be proportional to r^5. Wait, but wait, the options are given as how it changes with r. So for a given range in r, the number of stars would be proportional to r^5. 

Wait another thought: Let
