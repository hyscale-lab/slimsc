Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation levels of atoms are related to the temperature. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, I think the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. Oh wait, but in this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given, and the excitation levels are compared between the two stars.

Wait, the question states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. But maybe the exact value isn't needed because the options involve a ratio of temperatures. So the key is the ratio of the excitation levels.

Let me think. For each star, the population ratio would depend on their respective temperatures. Let's say the ratio in star 1 is N1 and in star 2 is N2. The problem says N1 = 2 N2, I think. Wait, no, the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for a specific energy level, star_1's population is twice star_2's. So N1/N2 = 2.

Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the upper level to the lower level. Let me get that right.

In each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly for star_2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but wait a second, if the energy difference is the same (since it's the same transition for iron), then the ratio for star
