Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because pericyclic reactions are a bit tricky for me. But let's take it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a different reaction. I need to figure out each product and match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, under H+ and heat to form A. Hmm, what's this about? Well, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a molecule with two methoxy groups on a nitrogen attached to ethane. Wait, more accurately, it's (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? Or maybe (CH3O)2NCH2CH2? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2NCH2CH3, right? Because ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on N.

But wait, the reaction is with but-3-en-2-ol. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Let's draw it. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=C(CH2OH)CH2? No, wait: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2CH2OH. Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2 where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is: positions 1,2,3,4. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. So structure is CH2=CH-CHOH-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4? No, wait wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3, and the OH on C2.

Wait, no: but-3-en-2-ol structure: the four carbons. Position 2 has the OH, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So structure is CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2? No, with a double bond between 3 and 4. So it's CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2 can't be right because but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2OH? No, that's 1-butene... No, but-3-en-2-ol would be the structure where the double bond is between 3 and 4, and the OH is on 2: so the structure is CH2CH2CH(OH
