Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). So numbering the ring: starting from the ethoxy as position 1, then clockwise, next is the t-Bu (position 2), then nitro at position 3.

Wait, wait. I should probably draw it out. Let's imagine the benzene ring with three substituents. Let's say the numbering goes like this: Ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, making it a meta arrangement for some substituents.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So that's adjacent positions. Wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, making a meta arrangement? No, wait. If it's 1,2,3 substituents, that's a vicinal arrangement for 1 and 2, but 3 is next to 2. Wait, but in benzene, 1,2,3 would form a triangle, each adjacent. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.

But wait, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, but their order is important. So the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are:

- Position 1: ethoxy (OEt)
- Position 2: tert-butyl (t-Bu)
- Position 3: nitro (NO2)

So in the ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 each have a substituent. So they're all adjacent to each other. So in the ring, OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2, NO2 at 3. Wait, but how does that look? Let me imagine the benzene ring:

1 (OEt) connected to 2 (t-Bu) and 6. 2 is connected to 3 (NO2). So 1 and 3 are two positions apart. So OEt and NO2 are in the meta positions relative to each other, but with the t-Bu in between.

Wait, maybe I should think about the directing effects of each substituent. Because the order in which we add substituents will determine where the next substituent goes.

The starting material is benzene. We are to perform a series of reactions to add these groups. The substituents can be added via electrophilic substitution. The order of adding substituents matters because each group directs the incoming electroph
