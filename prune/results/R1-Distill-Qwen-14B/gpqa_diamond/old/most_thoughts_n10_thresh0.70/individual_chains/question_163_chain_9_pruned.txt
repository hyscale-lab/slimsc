Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find out two things: the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with a specific pH and volume.

Hmm, alright, let's break this down. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, right? So it's a metal hydroxide. To dissolve it, especially in an acidic solution, I think it would react with the acid. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl, HNO3, etc., the reaction should be straightforward.

First, I'll write the formula for Fe(OH)3. Fe has a +3 charge, so each OH- is -1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ and 3 OH^- ions. 

The reaction when a strong acid like HCl is added would proceed as follows: the H+ from the acid would react with the OH- ions in Fe(OH)3. But wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, isn't it? So maybe it's more about the acid providing H+ ions to neutralize the hydroxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 will react with the acid in a neutralization reaction. The general reaction for a metal hydroxide with a strong acid would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 would require 3 moles of H+ ions (from a strong acid like HCl) to dissolve completely.

First, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

Given that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles, or about 9.36e-4 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ for dissolution, the total moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

Wait, but the acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed can be calculated using n = M * V.
