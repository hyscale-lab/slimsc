Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

The system has three spins, S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states, which would make the total number of possible states 2^3 = 8. Right, so I'll need to consider all eight possible combinations of spins and calculate the energy for each.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Wait, J is a coupling constant, I think. So the energy depends on the product of each pair of spins. Let me think about how each term contributes.

Each pair product S_i S_j can be either +1 (if the spins are the same) or -1 (if they're opposite). So each individual term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 is ±1. Then the sum of these three terms will be some integer between -3 and +3, right?

So E would be -J times that sum. Which would make E something like -J*(3) if all three pairs are +1, or -J*(-3) if all are -1. Wait, no, if all three are +1, sum is 3, E is -3J. If all are -1, sum is -3, so E is 3J. Hmm, but I think I should think about each possible state and compute E for each.

Let me list all possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 as either +1 or -1.

Let's make a table:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   Compute S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum is 3 → E= -J*(3) = -3J

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum=1+(-1)+(-1) = -1 → E= -J*(-1) = J

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 → sum= (-1)+1+(-1) = -1 → E= J

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → sum= (-1)+(-1)+1 = -1 → E= J

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → sum= (-1)+(-1)+1 = -1 → E= J

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 → sum= (-1)+1+(-1) = -1 → E= J

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 → E= J

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum=3 → E= -3J

Wait, so in the states 2,3,4,5,6,7, each has E=J, and states 1 and 8 have E=-3J. Let me count: states 1 and 8 are the only ones with E=-3J, so two states. The other six have E=J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(β E), but since E is negative, it's exp(-β E), because Z is sum e^{-β E} (since E is the energy, Z=Σ exp(-β E)).

Wait, wait. Wait the definition of the partition function is Z = sum exp( - β E_i ), where E_i is the energy of state i. But in this case E_i is negative because E is -J times something. So I have to be careful.

Wait
