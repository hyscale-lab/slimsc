Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says. 

The scenario is that I've prepared an unknown compound and used FTIR and 1H NMR to identify it. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR has several signals, and importantly, none of them are vinyl hydrogens. Additionally, two complex splitting patterns are observed in the NMR: one is a doublet of triplet of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. 

I need to choose between four options, all of which are carboxylic acids with different substituents. Let me list them again:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH  
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH  
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH  
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH  

First, let me think about the IR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H stretch, probably from a carboxylic acid since those have broad, strong O-H absorptions. The peak at 1700 cm^-1 is likely from a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits. So, all four options have a carboxylic acid group, so that doesn't narrow it down yet.

Now, looking at the NMR data. There are no vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds or rings with adjacent hydrogens. So the structure isn't something like a cyclohexene or an alkene. All the options are branched structures, so that's fine.

Each option has a central structure. Let me think about the structures:

Option D: The structure is (CH3CH2)(CH(CH3))2COOH. Wait, noâ€”let me write the structures more clearly. 

Looking at each option:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, wait, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, perhaps it's a four-carbon chain, with the middle carbons each having two substituents: one CH3 and one C2H5. Wait, no, the formula seems to be:

The main chain might be longer. Wait, perhaps it's:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the carboxylic acid is at the end, and the middle two carbons each have a CH3 and C2H5 group attached? Or is it more like a neopentyl group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is like this: The molecule is a carboxylic acid attached to a chain where the second and third carbons have substituents. Let me try to draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group attached to a CH2COOH. Let me think about the substituents.

Wait, each option has a different substituent arrangement.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the absence of vinyl hydrogens is clear, so all the structures are mostly branched, no alkenes. Now, the NMR signals have complex splitting, which suggests that the protons are split by neighboring protons from multiple directions, leading to their complex multiplet patterns.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. That's a lot
