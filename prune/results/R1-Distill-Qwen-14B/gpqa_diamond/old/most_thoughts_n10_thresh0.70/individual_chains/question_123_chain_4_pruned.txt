Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, okay, let me try to wrap my head around it.

The question says that in the ejecta's reference frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but the problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, so Newton's laws apply here, and we don't have to worry about acceleration or anything like that—just constant velocity.

Wait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. Let me read again. It says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

Wait, so the time given is the proper time in the ejecta's frame. Oh, but wait—no, because both are inertial frames. So I think we're dealing with a simple velocity and time relationship, but perhaps with Lorentz transformations since we're dealing with speeds a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is way faster than typical everyday speeds, but the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light. That's a decent fraction, about 20% of c. So relativistic effects might
