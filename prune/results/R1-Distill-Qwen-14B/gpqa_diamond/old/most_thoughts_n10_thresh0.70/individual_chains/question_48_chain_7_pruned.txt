Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Let me list out each step and think about what's happening.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When ketones react with bromine, I think it's usually a bromination. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition? No, wait, cyclohexanone is a saturated ketone. Oh, wait, I think that when a ketone is treated with bromine in a certain condition, it might undergo some kind of addition. Alternatively, wait, no—maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of substitution.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Adding bromine (Br2) might lead to an addition reaction. Oh, wait, but Br2 can add to double bonds, but cyclohexanone has a single bond. So maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Oh wait, wait—could it be a bromination via some kind of enol formation? Or maybe it's a diels-alder type reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone can undergo ring-opening when treated with a brominating agent. Oh, right, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack. Wait
