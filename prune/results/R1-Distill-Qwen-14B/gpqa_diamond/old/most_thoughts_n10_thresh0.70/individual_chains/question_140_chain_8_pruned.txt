Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and take notes.

The question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0 degrees. So B is probably a solid at room temperature, but just a bit below, like maybe ice? Or something similar.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid, since they're also called keto acids) reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe X is something like a base because acids and bases reacting would neutralize each other. Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction, like maybe X is a reducing agent.

Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I remember that sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a common reducing agent used in organic reactions. Also, something like sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. But wait, what about Grignard reagents? They are organomagnesium compounds, like CH2MgBr, used to form carbon-carbon bonds. Oh, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps it's a metal with a common heavy isotope, like chlorine maybe? Or something else.

Wait, let me think. Let's break down what each part could be.

First, the reaction with liquid Y. Y is a liquid at room temperature. Common liquid reagents could be something like water, but maybe another solvent. Alternatively, liquid Y could be an acid or a base. The reaction is violent, so perhaps it's a strong reaction, like a metal reacting with water, but that might form H2 gas. But wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule of W is neutral, meaning it's a noble gas? Because if the number of neutrons equals protons, the atom would be electrically neutral. Alternatively, maybe a molecule like CO2, but that's not a noble gas. Wait, no, CO2 has 12 +16*2 = 44 g/mol, but the neutrons and protons in the molecule's atoms? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps for gas W, the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. If it's a molecule, maybe each atom in the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. For example, O2: each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since
