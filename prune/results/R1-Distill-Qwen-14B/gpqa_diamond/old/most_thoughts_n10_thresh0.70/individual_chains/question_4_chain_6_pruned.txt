Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting because in our real world, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate a single pole. But the question is about how Maxwell's equations would change in such a universe. 

Wait, Maxwell's equations are these four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall them. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism
3. Faraday's Law of Induction
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition)

Right, in our universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism says that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. That's because there are no isolated magnetic poles—every magnet has two poles, so the field lines form closed loops. So the equation is ∇·B = 0.

But in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So that would mean that the magnetic field lines could start and end at these poles. That would change Gauss's Law for magnetism. Instead of the divergence being zero, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. Like how Gauss's Law for electricity has the electric flux proportional to the electric charge enclosed.

So in our scenario, that equation would be different. Additionally, Faraday's Law is about the curl of the electric field being proportional to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux. But wait, if magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect Faraday's Law? Or Ampère's Law?

Wait, Ampère's Law in our world is about the curl of the magnetic field being proportional to the current plus the displacement current. That's for the magnetic field around moving charges or changing electric fields. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that change Ampère's Law or Faraday's Law? 

Faraday's Law in our world is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic charges, would there be a term for their current? Because in Maxwell's equations, for each equation, the presence of a charge or current affects the other fields. So, for example, if there's a magnetic current, perhaps Faraday's Law would have an additional term.

Wait, in our world, Gauss's Law is ∇·E = ρ/ε₀, and Gauss's Law for magnetism is
