Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution after mixing all of them.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each component. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters.

Let me compute each separately.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but in this case, I need to consider its H+ contribution along with the other acids.

Wait, but wait. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate, so all its H+ will contribute. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so all OH- will come from it.

So, let me find moles for each H+ and OH-.

Wait, wait. Let's think about each solution and what they contribute in terms of H+ and OH-.

First solution: CH3COOH. As a weak acid, it will contribute H+ but not completely. But when mixed with a strong base, some of its H+ might react. Hmm, but maybe I should first consider neutralization between strong acid and strong base, then see what's left.

Wait, let's list all the H+ and OH- sources.

HCl: strong acid. Each molecule gives 1 H+. So moles of H+ from HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: strong base. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- (since Ba(OH)2 â†’ Ba^2+ + 2OH^-). So moles of OH- = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Multiply by 2 because each mole gives 2 OH-:
