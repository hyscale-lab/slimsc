Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer and in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going through the glass, and the glass itself is moving forward. I'm trying to visualize this setup.

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium can be affected. But how exactly? Oh right, the index of refraction plays a role here. The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, in the glass, the speed is 1/n (since c is given as 1 here).

But wait, the glass itself is moving. So this is a scenario where both the medium and the light are moving relative to the lab frame. Hmm, I think this involves some sort of velocity addition, maybe using special relativity? Or maybe it's just a problem using Galilean transformations because the velocities might be non-relativistic.

Wait, the question says the glass is moving at velocity v. I don't know if v is close to the speed of light or not. Since the options don't involve any square roots or Lorentz factors, maybe it's a non-relativistic approach—so using Galilean addition.

Galilean velocity addition says that if you have an object moving at u in the medium's frame, then in the lab frame, it's u' = u + v. But wait, in this case, the medium itself is moving, so perhaps the light's velocity in the lab frame would be different.

Wait no, the medium's frame is moving at velocity v—so the light's velocity in the medium's frame is v_light = c/n (but c is 1, so 1/n). So in the lab frame, the light's velocity would be (1/n) + v? But wait, that can't be right because the speed of light shouldn't be more than c, which is 1. Let me think again.

Wait, the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So
