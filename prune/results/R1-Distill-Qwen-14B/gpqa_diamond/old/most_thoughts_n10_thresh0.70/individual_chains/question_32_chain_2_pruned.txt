Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be lithium-6 because lithium has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, atomic number 3 and mass number 6. So the mass number A is 6.

The problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their kinetic energy is significant and can't be ignored. So we need to calculate the total energy or the kinetic energy, but the question asks for the energy of the collider. Hmm, I think in particle physics contexts, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes it's the total energy. I might need to clarify that later.

The speed given is 0.96c. That's pretty fast, so relativistic effects are definitely in play here. Okay, so I should use the relativistic energy formulas. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, so gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let's compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is approximately 3.5714. Let me double-check that calculation. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? So yes, correct.

But wait, the mass of the nucleus X is the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. So the rest mass energy is the mass of the nucleus times c squared. But in particle physics, when we talk about energy, we often use units where c is set to 1, so energy in GeV, mass in GeV/c². Therefore, the rest energy would be m*c², but when c=1, it's just m.

So I need to find the rest mass of Li-6. Li has atomic number 3, so it's 3 protons and 6 nucleons (3 protons + 3 neutrons). The mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is approximately 0.938 GeV/c². Wait, wait, wait, I think the proton mass is about 938 MeV, which is 0.938 GeV. So each nucleon is roughly 0.938 GeV/c².

So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be approximately 6 * 0.938 GeV/c². Let me compute that: 6 * 0.938 = 5.628 GeV/c². But wait, wait, I'm probably oversimplifying. Because the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy (mass defect), but in this case, I think the question expects us to use the sum of the individual nucleons for simplicity. So I'll proceed with 5.628 GeV/c² as the rest mass energy.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV. Let me calculate that: 3.5714 * 5.628. Let's see, 3 *5.628 is 16.884, 0.5714 *5.628 is about 3.214 (because 0.5 *5.628 is 2.814, 0.0714 *5.628 is about 0.403, so 2.814+0.403=3.217). So adding up, 16.884 +3.217≈20.101 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is asking for the energy of the collider. Do they mean the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because in accelerators, sometimes the energy refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Let me
