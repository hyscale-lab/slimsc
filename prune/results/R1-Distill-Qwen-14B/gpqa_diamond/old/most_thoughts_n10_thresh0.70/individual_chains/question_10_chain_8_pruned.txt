Okay, let's try to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So I think I need to calculate or compare the densities of each option.

Looking at the options:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, right? I think Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³. So if it's Earth's mass and radius, its density would be the same as Earth's. So that's 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, they already gave the density here. So that's 5.5. But does the mass affect it here? Because they've directly given the density. So it's 5.5.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition as Earth, so same density as Earth, which is 5.5. Because density depends on the material, not the mass. So mass doesn't change the density if the composition is same. So c's density is 5.5.

Option d) Same composition as Earth but half Earth's mass. Again, same composition, same density of 5.5.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I'm missing something. Because the question is about exoplanets, so perhaps some have different compositions. Let me double-check each option.

Wait, looking again: 

Option a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth, density is 5.5.

Option b) 2 Earth masses, but what's the radius? Oh, wait, the question for option b says a density of 5.5. So its density is given, so it's 5.5. But wait, the mass is 2 Earth masses. Let's see: if the mass is 2 and the density is 5.5, what's the radius? Because density = mass/volume, and volume is (4/3)πr³. But for this question, perhaps I don't need to calculate the radius, because the question is about density. So option b's density is 5.5.

Option c) Same composition as Earth, so same density. So 5.
