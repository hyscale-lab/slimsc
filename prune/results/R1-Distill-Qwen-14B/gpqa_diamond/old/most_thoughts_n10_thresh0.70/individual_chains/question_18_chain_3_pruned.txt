Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each more massive than the Sun. Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2. But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Oh right, photospheric composition, so it's about what's in their outer layers.

The given data includes some abundance ratios measured using the EW method under LTE. Let me list what I know:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star_1 is higher by 0.3 dex. So, using the definition of the logarithmic scale, it's like the ratio of their abundances is 10^0.3 times more than solar.

Wait, no. Wait, the notation [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant than Y relative to the sun.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So Star_2 has Mg more abundant relative to Si than the Sun.

Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) minus solar. So Star_1 has Fe abundance the same as the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg is same as Sun in Star_2.

Wait, but what about the photospheric compositions given for the Sun? The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5, so nMg/nH =10^(-5).

But wait, how are these values used
