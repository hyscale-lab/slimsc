Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Hmm, let's start by carefully analyzing each piece of information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad—maybe it's a strong O-H group. Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those seem important. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring, like conjugated C=C or something else. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester, or another group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere—maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring. But wait, if it's aromatic, the protons would be in a different region. But the question says "vinyl hydrogens," so probably an alkene.

Then, looking at the Mass Spec data, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what could that be? 45 is a common mass for certain fragments. Let's think: the fragment could be a CH3CO+ ion (which is 43?), no, wait, maybe. Or perhaps it's another group. Wait, 45 is the molecular ion for something like (CH3)2COH? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion or an aldehyde group. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2=CH-O group? Or maybe a CH3CH2O+? Let me think. Another possibility: the fragment could be a COOH group losing something. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2COH? No, wait. Let me calculate: 45 is 12*3 + 1
