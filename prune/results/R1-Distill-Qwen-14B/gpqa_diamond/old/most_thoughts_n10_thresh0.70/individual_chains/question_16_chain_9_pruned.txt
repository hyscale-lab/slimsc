Okay, so I have this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. I remember that optical activity has to do with a compound's ability to rotate plane-polarized light, which usually means the compound has chiral centers.

Let me list out the compounds one by one and analyze each for chirality.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, this is a butene derivative. The structure is CH2=CHCH2Cl maybe? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a chloro and a methyl. Wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure is Cl attached to C1, a methyl on C2, and the rest are CH2 groups.

   Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So it's ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, but wait, wait the structure is 2-methyl but-1-ene. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons: 1,2,3,4. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2? No, that would be propene. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether this molecule has any stereogenic centers. A stereogenic center is a carbon with four different substituents. Let's see: for
