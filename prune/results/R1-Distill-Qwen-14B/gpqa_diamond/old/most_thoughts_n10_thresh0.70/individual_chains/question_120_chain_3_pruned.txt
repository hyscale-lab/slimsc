Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's start by recalling what I know about parallax and star distribution.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as observed from Earth during the year. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is closer (smaller distance), its parallax (plx) is larger. The formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions, right? So there's the same number of stars per unit volume throughout space.

I'm trying to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like per unit plx) changes with plx. So, the number of stars in a slice of parallax thickness dplx, how does that scale with plx.

Wait, let's think in terms of distance. Parallax is 1/d, so as plx increases, distance decreases. So if I imagine a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd, the volume of that shell would be 4πd² dd. Because it's a spherical shell, surface area 4πd², times thickness dd.

But wait, in this problem, we're dealing with parallax, not distance. So how does the number of stars relate to parallax?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume element dV is proportional to dV. So n = k * dV, where k is the number density.

But how does dV relate to parallax? Let's see. The volume element in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. But how about in terms of plx? Since plx p =1/d, then d = 1/p. So, dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because p = 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. But
