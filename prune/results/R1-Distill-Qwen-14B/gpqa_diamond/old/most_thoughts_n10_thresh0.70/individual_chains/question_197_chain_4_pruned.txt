Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Then, we need to find out what the final product is. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. 

First, I'll look at the given data: IR and 1H NMR spectra.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1.

Hmm, I remember that the IR spectrum gives information about functional groups. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 probably indicates an -OH group, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak around 2500-3300. Alternatively, an -OH in an alcohol would be a broad peak around 3400. 

The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is present here. So the 1720 might be a carbonyl from a carboxylic acid, which usually appears around 1700 cm-1. But wait, aldehydes are higher, around 2800 for the C-H stretch and 1720 for the C=O. So maybe an aldehyde? Or maybe an ester or ketone.

Then the peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has an aromatic ring. Also, the 1610 is usually indicative of aromatic rings, maybe substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, since that lowers the wavenumber. Alternatively, it might be conjugated carbonyl groups.

Now looking at the NMR data:

The
