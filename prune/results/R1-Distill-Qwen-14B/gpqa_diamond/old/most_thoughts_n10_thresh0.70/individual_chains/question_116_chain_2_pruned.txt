Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so it's a multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions and NMR spectroscopy. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

So, the question starts with Compound A. The proton NMR has two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet would mean each proton is next to two others, so maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Wait, if it's a triplet integrating to 6H, maybe that's two sets of CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Like, perhaps two CH3 groups on either side of a CH2? Or wait, maybe it's a di-substituted something. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Compound A is something like neopentyl group or maybe a diethyl ether. Wait, diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups. But the NMR for diethyl ether would have a triplet for the CH3 groups and a quartet for the CH2. But wait, in diethyl ether, the CH2 groups are next to another OCH2, so the splitting would be a quartet for the CH2. Let me see: in diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a triplet because each CH3 is next to the CH2 (which has two Hs). But the CH2 would be a quartet because each CH2 is next to another CH2 group. Wait, but diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So each CH3 is next to a CH2, giving a triplet for the CH3. The CH2 would each be next to another CH2, so maybe a quartet for each, but as they're identical, the integration would be 4H for the CH2 groups.

So, if Compound A's NMR shows a triplet for 6H (which would be two CH3 groups, each with 3H, so 2Ã—3=6), and a quartet for 4H (two CH2 groups, each with 2H), that would fit diethyl ether. So Compound A is diethyl ether.

Diethyl ether, structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So when it undergoes monobromination to form Compound B, where would the bromine add? Monobromination of diethyl ether would likely proceed via an SN2 mechanism, leading to substitution at the less hindered position. But wait, diethyl ether is symmetrical, so either end is the same. So the product would be ethyl bromoethyl ether? Wait, wait, no. Wait, when diethyl ether reacts with a brominating agent like HBr or another source, it could undergo substitution. But wait, diethyl ether is a good leaving group? Oh, wait, maybe it's more about the formation of an ether bromide.

Wait, actually, when diethyl ether reacts with HBr in the presence of a Lewis acid like H2SO4, it can undergo an acid-catalyzed substitution. The O in the ether would protonate, making it a better leaving group. Then, HBr would attack one of the adjacent CH2 groups. So the mechanism would be an SN2 substitution, leading to the formation of ethyl bromoethyl ether, but since the starting material is symmetrical, the product would be the same regardless of which side the Br adds. So Compound B would be (bromoethyl)ethyl ether, i.e., CH2CH2Br-O-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, diethyl ether is CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3. After substitution, the structure becomes CH2CH2Br-O-CH2CH3? Wait, no, more accurately, one of the CH3CH2-O- groups would lose a CH3CH2 group and gain a Br. So B would be CH2CH2Br-O-CH2CH3. Wait, no. Actually, when diethyl ether undergoes monobromination, it would form ethyl bromoethyl ether, which is (CH2CH3OCH2CH2Br). Wait, maybe I should think about it more clearly.

Wait, the structure of diethyl ether is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. When it reacts with HBr, say, under acidic conditions, one of the CH2CH3 groups would leave, but that doesn't make sense. No, wait, the O in the ether would get protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, HBr would attack one of the carbons adjacent to the oxygen. So the substitution would occur at one of the CH2 groups. So the product would be CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3. But wait, no: the ether oxygen is in the middle, so if you substitute one of the CH2 groups, you get CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3, which is ethyl bromoethyl ether. So Compound B is ethyl bromoethyl ether.

Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base. For an ether like ethyl bromoethyl ether, treatment with a strong base like alcoholic KOH would induce elimination, leading to formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism. So the base would abstract a proton adjacent to the Br, and the Br would leave, forming a double bond.

Wait, let me make sure. The structure of B is CH2CH2Br-O-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait: diethyl ether is CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3. After substitution, one CH
