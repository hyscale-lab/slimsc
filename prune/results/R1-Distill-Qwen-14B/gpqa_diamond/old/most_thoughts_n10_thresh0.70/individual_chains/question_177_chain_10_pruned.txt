Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35. So the factor is about 2.25 or so.

Wait, so what do I know about luminosity and blackbody radiation? Oh right, the luminosity of a star can be determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the key here is to find the luminosity ratio L1/L2. Since L is proportional to R² T⁴, the ratio would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). 

We know R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times R2².

Now the tricky part is finding the temperatures. The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That's the peak wavelength of their blackbody spectra. I remember Wien's law, which says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So if λ_max for both stars is the same, that suggests that their temperatures are the same. Wait, but wait! Oh, but wait, no, because the Doppler shift due to their velocities would affect the observed wavelength. Oh right, because if a star is moving towards us or away from us, the light we receive is Doppler shifted.

Wait, the problem gives the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So I need to consider the Doppler shift for Star_2's light.

Right, so the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength. For Star_2, if it's moving away, the observed wavelength λ' is longer than the rest wavelength λ0. If it's moving towards us, λ' is shorter. But wait, the problem says the observed wavelengths (the ones they appear brightest) are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift adjusts the observed λ_peak for Star_2 such that when combined with its intrinsic temperature, the observed λ_peak is same as Star_1.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote:

For Star_1: observed λ_max1 = λ0_1 (since radial velocity is zero, so no Doppler shift). But wait, no. Wait, the star emits at λ_max = b / T. So the peak is at λ0 = b / T1.

But if the star is moving with velocity v, the observed wavelength would be λ_obs = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) or something like that, but wait, for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ0 (1 + v_r / c ). But wait, wait: the formula I'm
