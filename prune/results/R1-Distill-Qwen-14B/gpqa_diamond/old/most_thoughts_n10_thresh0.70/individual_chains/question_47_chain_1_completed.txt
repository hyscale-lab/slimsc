Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 based on IR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, let's start by going through the data step by step.

First, the IR spectrum shows strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretching, right? Because amines or amides typically show peaks in that range. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. So, the compound probably has both an amide or amine group and an ester or ketone group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals often come from exchangeable protons, but wait, at 4 ppm, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group that's part of an ester or ether?
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet for 2H. Quartet usually implies two neighboring protons on each side. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group as part of an ester.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets. That sounds like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The lower ppm (7.0) might be the more substituted protons, and the higher (8.0) could be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl or nitro group.

Putting this together. The aromatic protons being a doublet each suggests a para-substituted benzene. So maybe it's something like p-aminobenzoate or p-ethoxybenzoate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the meta position. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which are probably para to substituents. So if substituents are at para, then the protons would be in pairs as doublets. Wait, but 3-ethoxy would be meta, so the aromatic protons might not be in such a clean doublet pattern. Not sure.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide has a structure like HCONR2. The 4-ethoxyphenyl would have substituents at para. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, one more deshielded than the other. But formamide's carbonyl would show up around 1680 cm-1, but the IR here is 1720, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe an ester instead.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would be ethyl propionate? Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H4NH2-C2H5COO-. Wait, no, the propionate is CH2CH2COOH as an ester. Wait, structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to a benzene ring with an amino group. Let me draw it. The benzene would have an amino group and an ester group at para positions. The NMR should show the ethyl group as triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5 (the OCH2CH2 part), and the amino group would show up as a broad peak. Wait, in the NMR data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Hmm, if it's an ester, like OCH2CH3, but wait, the quartet is at 4.5, which would be the OCH2CH2 part, and the triplet at 1.2 would be the CH3. So the ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3: the OCH2 would be around 4.1 (maybe lower) but in the data, it's at 4.5 for the quartet. Wait, maybe the quartet is the OCH2 in the ester, and the triplet is the CH3. Alternatively, perhaps a different structure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would have a benzoate ester (COOEt) and an amino group on the benzene ring at para positions. So the structure is O2NC6H4COOCH2CH3. The IR would have the carbonyl from the ester around 1720 cm-1, which matches. The amine would show N-H stretch in IR. The NMR would have the ethyl group as triplet (CH3) at 1.2, and quartet (OCH2) at around 4.2 ppm, but in the data it's at 4.5. Hmm, wait, maybe the OCH2 is at 4.5? Let me think. The OCH2 would typically be around 4.0-4.3, but maybe in this case, it's a bit downfield. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group is part of an amide?

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Here, X=0, so (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: likely a benzene ring (3) and a carbonyl (1), plus maybe an amine (but that's a single bond). So yes, benzene, carbonyl, and possibly an ester group.

Looking at the NMR again, the quartet at 4.5 (2H) is probably an OCH2 connected to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester: OCO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, the OCH2 would be the one next to oxygen. So the ethyl group in an ester would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would split into a quartet because it's adjacent to a CH3, which has 3H. So the quartet would be the OCH2 (CH2O), and the triplet would be the CH3. So in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit higher than normal for OCH2 (which is usually around 4.1-4.3), but maybe it's because of the adjacent amine or something else causing deshielding.

The 4.0 ppm (2H, broad singlet) is tricky. Broad suggests exchange, like an amine or maybe an alcohol. But at 4.0, maybe it's an NH2 group. Wait, but if the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group would be on the benzene and would be -NH2. That would show up as a broad peak in the NMR. But in the data, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which doesn't fit for a -NH2 (which would be a singlet, maybe around 1-5 ppm as broad, but for 2H if it's a -NH2, but wait, -NH2 is one group, so maybe two H's in a broad peak). Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to oxygen but in a different environment, like an ethyl group in an amide.

Wait, the IR shows strong absorption at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually N-H stretches. So if the compound has an amide group or an amine. The 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. So if it's an amide, the carbonyl is around 1650, but 1720 is more like an ester or a ketone. So maybe the carbonyl is an ester.

So if it's an ester and an amine, perhaps an ethyl ester and an amino group on the benzene.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt at para positions.

The NMR would show the ethyl ester as triplet (CH3) at 1.2, quartet (OCH2) at around 4.2 or so. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but maybe it's correct. Let's check the aromatic region. If the ring has substituents at para, then the aromatic protons would be as two doublets. The more deshielded (near the electron-withdrawing group, like COOEt) would be at higher ppm, so 8.0 ppm. The other two (next to the amino group, which is electron-donating) would be at 7.0. So that fits the data: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H).

What about the 4.0 ppm peak (2H, broad)? Hmm, if the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is on the ring. The NH2 would show as a broad peak, but where? Amines can appear in the NMR as broad signals. But in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, maybe it's not the NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group.

Wait, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH3

and the benzene has NH2 and COOEt at para positions.

So the OCH2CH3 would give a quartet around 4.2 ppm (for OCH2) and triplet for CH3 at 1.2 ppm. So in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe that's possible. But then why is there a peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad)? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the NH2 group. But in most cases, NH2 protons are broad singlets, but they can also split into different patterns if they are exchanging. But in the data, it's 2H, which is a bit confusing because NH2 would be one group but with two H. So maybe it is the NH2.

Wait, but in the options, looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is:

PhNH2-COOEt.

So the aromatic protons would be two doublets as observed.

The ethyl ester would have the triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5. But wait, the quartet in the data is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than expected for the OCH2 in an ester. So perhaps this isn't the right structure.

Looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON-(4-OCH2CH3-C6H4). Hmm, the formamide group would have a carbonyl, which would have a strong IR around 1680 cm-1, but our data is 1720, which is higher, more like an ester.

Alternatively, option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate ester would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be OCO-OCH2CH2CH3 perhaps? Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO- as an ester, which would be OCO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the ester would be OCO-O-R where R is the alkyl group. So for propionate, R would be CH2CH2CH3, but that's a propyl group. Wait, but the given IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which would fit an ester.

So if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, structure is OCO-PhNH2, but wait, more accurately, the ester would be OCO-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring which also has an NH2 group.

Wait, then the structure would be:

Ph-NH2 - attached to the benzene, and COO-Pr (propyl) group.

But the NMR would show the propyl group as triplet of triplets perhaps. Let me think: the OCO-OCH2CH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet (coupled with CH2), the middle CH2 as quartet (coupled with OCH2 and CH2CH3), and the adjacent CH2 as triplet (coupled with CH2CH2CH3). So in the NMR, we'd expect a triplet around 1.7 ppm (CH2CH2CH3), a quartet around 4.0 ppm (OCH2), and so on. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. So perhaps not a propyl group.

Alternatively, the ethyl group in the ester would explain the triplet and quartet. So back to ethyl ester.

So in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The NMR data for the ethyl group would be triplet at 1.2 and quartet at around 4.2. But the data shows the quartet at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit off. Could it be that the amino group is causing some deshielding, shifting the OCH2 upfield or downfield? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider option B again: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would have a formamide group (HCON-) attached to a benzene with an ethoxy group at para. So the IR would have a strong carbonyl from the formamide, but the IR data here is 1720, which is higher than formamide (around 1680). So that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the IR is of an amide. Wait, no, amides typically have lower carbonyl frequencies than esters.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at meta. So, the benzamide would have CONH2, but then where's the ethoxy? At the meta position. So the aromatic protons would be... It depends on substitution. But the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So if substituents are at meta, the aromatic protons might not give such clean doublets. So maybe A is not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is attached to a benzene which has ethoxy at para. The formamide would have a CONH2 group. The IR would have a carbonyl at ~1680. But the given data is 1720, which doesn't fit. So B might not be correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the benzene has NH2 and a propionate ester group. The propionate ester would have an OCH2CH2CH3 group. The IR would have a carbonyl at ~1720, which fits. The NMR would show triplet for the CH3 of propyl, quartet for the CH2 next to O, and another quartet for the CH2 next to that. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 (2H) which could be the OCH2, and triplet at 1.20 (3H) for the terminal CH3. Wait, but the propyl group would have more than two sets of peaks. Another thought: perhaps the ethyl group in the ester is split into a triplet and quartet, but the data shows 4.5 as quartet (2H), and 1.2 as triplet (3H). That's consistent with an ethyl group, not propyl. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count the carbons for each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2 (benzoate: C6H5COO-), plus ethyl (C2H5). So total is C9H10O2. But the formula is C9H11NO2. Oh wait, the amine adds a nitrogen and a hydrogen. So the structure would be C6H5(NH2)COOEt.

Wait, molecular formula: benzene (6 C), COOEt (3 C: COO plus ethyl) and NH2. So 6 + 3 + 0 (because NH2 doesn't add C). Wait, no, the formula is C9H11NO2.

Let me calculate: benzene ring (6 C), COOEt (3 C: C from COO and ethyl's 2 C?), Wait, COOEt is O=C-O-OCH2CH3? No, it's O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the COOEt contributes 3 C (the C from COO and the two from ethyl). So 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) = 9 C. So total C is 9, which matches.

Hydrogen: Benzene has 5 H (since two substituents, NH2 and COOEt at para; benzene would have 4 H, but wait, wait, benzene with two substituents (para) would have 4 H in two doublets. So in the structure:

Each substituent is at para. So the benzene has 4 H as two doublets. So in any case, the H count: let's see.

Structure: 

Ph- NH2 (which has 2 H) and Ph-COOEt.

Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2.

Let me count H:

Ph group (C6H5): 5 H.

COOEt: O=C-O-CH2CH3.

COOEt contributes 3 H (from the ethyl group: 2 in OCH2 and 3 in CH3? No, OCH2CH3 is 2+3=5 H, but actually, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3: the O connects to CH2, which connects to CH3. So the ethyl is CH2CH3. So the ethyl contributes 2 (from CH2) + 3 (from CH3) =5 H. But wait, in the ester group, the ethyl is OCH2CH3, so 2 H on OCH2 and 3 H on CH3.

So the total H from the ethyl is 5 H.

The benzene ring has 4 H (as two doublets, 2 each).

The amine group is NH2: 2 H.

Plus any other H? The COO group is O=C-O-, which doesn't add H.

So total H: 4 (Ph) +5 (ethyl) + 2 (NH2) = 11 H. Which matches the formula C9H11NO2.

So option D's structure accounts for all the H. So the IR shows N-H stretches (from NH2) and carbonyl (from ester). The NMR should match.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR of option D:

The ethyl group: OCH2CH3 gives quartet for OCH2 (integral 2H) and triplet for CH3 (3H) at 1.20 ppm. So that matches the data.

The NH2 group would show up as a broad peak, but in the data, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Wait, that doesn't fit. Because the NH2 would be expected to be around 1-5 ppm as a broad singlet, but 2H would imply something else. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not present in the NMR data because it's exchanging and broad, but maybe it's not shown, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the given NMR doesn't show a peak for the NH2. But that can't be right because in the structure, it's present. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is deprotonated or something else. No, the compound is likely in its neutral state.

Wait another thought: the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) might not be the NH2. Could it be an OCH2 group from something else? But in the structure of D, the only OCH2 is from the ester, which is at 4.5 ppm as a quartet. So perhaps that 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2. But why is it at 4.0 and as 2H? Let's think about the splitting. NH2 is usually a singlet, but if it's adjacent to something, it could split into a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH group, but in this case, it's -NH2.

Wait, maybe the peak at 4.0 isn't from the NH2. Let me think: the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, and their integration adds up to 4H, which makes sense for a para-substituted benzene.

So in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) is still a puzzle. Maybe it's an NH2 group. But in that case, why is it integrating to 2H? Oh wait, because it's two protons in the NH2 group. So the signal at 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which is a broad singlet. But in the data, it's a broad singlet (bs) but with 2H. That makes sense.

Wait, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which would fit an NH2 group. Alternatively, sometimes NH2 can be a singlet with some exchange broadening. So the data would have:

- 1.20 (t, 3H) ethyl CH3
- 4.5 (q, 2H) ethyl OCH2
- 4.0 (s, 2H) NH2
But wait, the data shows the 4.0 as a broad singlet. So perhaps that's correct.

Alternatively, the NH2 might be a broad peak, but in 1H NMR, -NH2 often shows as a broad peak, sometimes as a singlet, but sometimes as a multiplet if there's coupling. But in the data, it's a broad singlet, so it could be the NH2.

So putting it all together, the data fits option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Wait, but what about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would have a formamide group (HCON-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The formamide would have a carbonyl, which would appear around 1650-1680 cm-1 in IR. But the given IR shows a strong band at 1720, which is higher, more like an ester. So option B is probably not correct.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy at meta and the amide (CONH2) group. The aromatic protons would not give two doublets but perhaps a more complex splitting, so it's less likely to fit the NMR data.

So the most likely option is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


The compound to identify is C9H11NO2, and the provided data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The IR spectrum shows strong absorption bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹, indicative of N-H stretching, and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester. The 1H NMR data includes:

- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a CH3 group in an ethyl ester.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, possibly from an NH2 group or an OCH2 group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, likely from an OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide with an ethoxy group at the meta position.
- The aromatic protons would not produce two clean doublets in the NMR due to the meta substitution pattern. This does not match the NMR data.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCON-) attached to a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at the para position.
- The carbonyl of a formamide typically absorbs at ~1680 cm⁻¹ in IR, but the given IR shows a stronger band at 1720 cm⁻¹, more consistent with an ester. Additionally, the NMR would not show a quartet at 4.5 ppm for an OCH2 group, as the structure lacks an ethyl ester.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: A benzene ring with an NH2 group and a propionate ester group at the para position.
- The propionate ester would produce a triplet for CH3 and other splitting patterns for the CH2 groups, but the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm and a triplet at 1.20 ppm, consistent with an ethyl ester, not a propyl ester.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: A benzene ring with an NH2 group and an ethyl ester group (COOCH2CH3) at the para position.
- The IR spectrum matches, as the carbonyl of the ester absorbs at ~1720 cm⁻¹, and the N-H stretching of the NH2 group explains the bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹.
- The NMR data:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** matches the CH3 group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** matches the OCH2 group of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** corresponds to the NH2 group.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** match the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene.
- The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is also satisfied.
- **Matches all data.**

### Conclusion:
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

ANSWER: D
