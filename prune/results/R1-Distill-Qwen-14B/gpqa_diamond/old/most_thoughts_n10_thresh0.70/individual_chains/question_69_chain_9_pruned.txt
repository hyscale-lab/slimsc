Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, the observed lifetime depends on their speed. The proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime gets dilated due to time dilation in special relativity. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma times τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated using the formula gamma = E / m, where E is the total energy of the particle and m is its rest mass. So here, E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that. Gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 times 7.9 is 27? Let me check: 3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41*(8-0.1) = 27.28 - 0.341 = 26.939. Close enough. So gamma is approximately 7.9.

So the observed lifetime τ is gamma * τ₀. So τ = 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8*7.9 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 s is 6.32e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does this help me find the resolution needed? Oh, right, the resolution refers to the minimum distance we can measure. Because the particle decays, and the decay products travel a certain distance before being detected, but if the time resolution isn't good enough, we might not see the decay.

Wait, or wait. Let me think again. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So the distance L is v * τ. But since tau is the dilated lifetime, that's the correct one to use.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, L = c * gamma * tau_0 * beta. Hmm, because beta is v/c. So another way: L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the correct formula. The proper lifetime is tau_0, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0. The velocity of the particle is v = beta c. So distance L = v * tau (observed lifetime) = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but how do I find beta? Oh, because gamma is E/m, and beta can be found from gamma and the relation
