Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about a charge placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Oh right, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move freely, right?

So the setup is: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. Hmm, potential energy between charges, something to do with their configuration.

Wait, when you place a charge near a conductor, the conductor's induced charges will affect the potential. But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface must be zero. Oh wait, no, wait. A grounded conductor has its potential set to zero because it's in contact with the Earth, which is considered at zero potential.

But I'm a bit confused about how this affects the potential energy. Let me try to visualize. The charge q will induce opposite charges on the sphere's surface. Since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge on it would have gone to ground, but wait, noâ€”if the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charge would adjust until the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Oh wait, actually, when a charge is placed outside a conductor, the conductor's surface charges adjust such that the potential on the surface due to all charges (including induced) is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the conducting sphere's potential is determined by the charges on it. Since it's grounded,
