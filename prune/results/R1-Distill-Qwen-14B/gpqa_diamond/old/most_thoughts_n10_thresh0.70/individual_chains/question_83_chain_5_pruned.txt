Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I'm supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and pH changes depending on how much base has been added. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the initial step is to find the new concentration after dilution. I remember the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Wait, so M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL. The new volume V2 is 40 mL (20 + 20). So M2 would be (M1V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 1/4 *0.05 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me break this into parts. First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, so how many moles of acetic acid are there initially? The volume is 20 mL (0.02 L) of 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Or wait, no: 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. 20 mL is 0.02 L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

Wait, but the initial solution was diluted to 40 mL. So when we reach equivalence, we've added 10 mL of NaOH. But wait, the problem is about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 mL, 25% of that is 2.5 mL. So at 25% titration, 2.5 mL of NaOH has been added.

But wait, actually, in titration, the percentage is often by volume. So it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So yeah, 2.5 mL.

So first, let's handle the 25
