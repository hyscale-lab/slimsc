Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups. That makes them non-superimposable mirror images, leading to enantiomers which are optically active.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So the structure is like two benzene rings connected with a single bond between the first positions. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6 on each ring and carboxylate groups at position 2 on each. Wait, the single bond between the rings can allow rotation, but in some cases, substituents can make the structure rigid. If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule might not be chiral. But if the substituents are in a way that the two sides are not mirror images, maybe it has isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can't rotate to make the two sides match, leading to enantiomers. Wait, but wait: the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond, so if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it would have optical isomerism. So I think this compound has a plane of symmetry or not? Let me think. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The positions 2 and 6 on each ring are para to each other. So each ring is substituted at two positions. Wait, biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each. So the substituents on each ring are on opposite ends. So for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Wait, but the structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so both rings have nitro groups at 6. Similarly, 2,2' so both have COOCH3 at 2. So the substituents on each ring are the same. So each ring has nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. Are the substituents arranged symmetrically across the central bond?

Wait the central bond is between the 1 positions of each ring. So the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. Let me visualize: each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (which is next to position 1?), and the COOCH3 at position 2 (which is opposite to position 6). So if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, then maybe it's not chiral. But wait, in biphenyls, the substituents can lead to different isomers based on their positions. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it could be chiral.

Wait, wait. The substituents here are on both rings. Both have nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. So in each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents, each at opposite ends. So when looking at the entire molecule, the arrangement is symmetrical across the central bond. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism here. Or wait, maybe the arrangement is such that the molecule isn't symmetric. Let me think: if the substituents are in a way that no mirror plane exists, then it would be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes each side a mirror image. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should come back to this one.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula is CH3CO(O)OCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. As an ester, it would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent CH3 from the CH(OH) group. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the carbon with OH is the middle one. Let's see: it's connected to two CH3 groups (from CH3 and CH(OH)), a hydroxyl group, and a carbonyl group (from the COOCH3). Wait, no, the carbonyl is part of the ester. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the methyl group on the CH(OH)),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (the ester group),
- and the adjacent CH3 from the ethyl part? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is three carbons. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. No, wait, the structure is:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to
