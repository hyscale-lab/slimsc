Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question has two reactions, A and B, and I have to choose the correct major products from the options given. Let's take each reaction one by one.

First, reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+. I'm trying to remember what these reagents do. THF is a solvent, but KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. H+ is probably an acid workup.

Wait, potassium hydride is a strong base. So, maybe it's deprotonating something here. The starting material is a spiro alcohol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the alcohol's carbon.

The structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol... Let's imagine that. It's a spiro compound with a 6-membered ring (since 3 and 5 add up to 8, but spiro includes the bridge, so maybe 3 and 5 carbons in each ring? Hmm, maybe that's a bit complicated; perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanism.

I remember that when alcohols are treated with a strong base like KH, they can undergo elimination. Since this is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, maybe it's an E2 mechanism. Wait, but wait—it's a vinyl group attached. Vinyl groups are CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH–, right. So, the structure has a double bond adjacent to the alcohol.

Wait, the starting compound is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So it's a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group and an enol. So when treated with a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton to form a carbocation or undergo elimination.

Wait, another thought: spiro compounds can undergo ring-opening or rearrangement under certain conditions. But I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, in the presence of a strong base, maybe the alcohol is deprotonated, leading to an enolate or some conjugate base.

Wait, wait, but the reaction is in THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. Then, H+ is added. So, perhaps a deprotonation followed by protonation.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. One of the options for A is (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one. That's a bicyclic structure with a ketone. Another option is decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, which is a fused ring system with a ketone.

So, the starting material is
