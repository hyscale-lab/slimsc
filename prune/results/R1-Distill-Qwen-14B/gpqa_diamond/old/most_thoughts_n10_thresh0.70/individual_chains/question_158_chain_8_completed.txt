Okay, so I've got this question about transcription factors and mutations. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that transcription factors are proteins that help turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. They often work in a complex, sometimes needing to be activated first.

The question says that in an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit is waiting for an activation signal from a membrane phosphorylation cascade. Oh right, phosphorylation usually activates proteins. So when the serine residues in the transactivation domain are phosphorylated, the subunit dimerizes, moves to the nucleus, and helps in gene transcription.

Now, the mutations. There's a missense mutation X in the transactivation domain, and it's recessive, loss-of-function. So recessive means both alleles need to be mutated for the trait to show. Since it's loss-of-function, the mutation probably prevents the phosphorylation or the dimerization, so the transcription factor can't activate genes, right? But since the question is about mutation Y, I'll focus on that.

Mutation Y is a heterozygous missense in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative. Dominant-negative mutations interfere with the normal function of the protein, even when only one copy is mutated. So if Y is in the dimerization domain, the mutant subunit can't form dimers correctly. But because it's dominant-negative, it might prevent the wild-type subunits from dimerizing properly.

So when Y is present, the mutant subunit would compete with the wild-type ones. Since they can't form functional dimers, any wild-type subunits would be stuck trying to pair with the mutant ones, which can't dimerize. So the wild-type proteins are rendered nonfunctional because they can't form the necessary dimers to enter the nucleus and activate transcription.

Let me look at the options:

A) Change of protein conformation and gain-of-function. Unlikely, because both mutations X and Y are loss-of-function. Y is dominant-negative, so it would cause loss of function, not gain.

B) Protein degradation and loss of wild-type allele. Hmm, I don't think the mutation Y itself causes degradation. Maybe if the mutant protein is unstable, but I'm not sure. It could interfere with the wild-type function without degrading it.

C) Loss of dimerization and wild-type phenotype. No, because if dimerization can't happen, the wild-type shouldn't function. So the phenotype should be loss-of-function, not wild-type.

D) Protein aggregation and loss-of-function. If the mutant Y subunits can't dimerize properly, they might aggregate or form misfolded proteins. That could lead to the loss of function because the wild-type can't form dimers, and the mutant ones might be stuck in aggregates. So the cells can't transcribe the genes, leading to loss-of-function.

Wait, but what's the exact outcome when a dominant-negative mutation is present? The mutant protein competes with the wild-type, preventing them from forming functional complexes. So even though there's some wild-type proteins, they can't form dimers because the mutant proteins are in the way. So the overall function is lost. So the phenotype is loss-of-function.

Looking at the options again. Option D says protein aggregation and loss-of-function. That makes sense. Because if the mutant subunits can't form proper dimers, they might aggregate, leading to insoluble proteins and preventing any function. So the cells can't activate gene transcription, leading to loss-of-function.

Alternatively, option B mentions protein degradation. I'm not sure if the mutant protein is degraded. Maybe the cell's quality control degrades misfolded proteins, but if Y is dominant-negative, perhaps the mutant doesn't get degraded but instead disrupts the wild-type. So B might not be correct.

So the most likely answer is D: protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.


The question involves a transcription factor subunit that requires phosphorylation on serine residues in the transactivation domain to dimerize, move to the nucleus, and activate gene transcription. Mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation, while mutation Y in the dimerization domain is a dominant-negative mutation. The task is to determine the molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y.

Mutation Y, being dominant-negative, disrupts the normal function of the transcription factor by interfering with the dimerization process. This occurs because the mutant subunit competes with wild-type subunits, preventing them from forming functional dimers. Without proper dimerization, the transcription factor cannot enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** A gain-of-function phenotype is unlikely, as both mutations X and Y are loss-of-function mutations. Mutation Y does not cause a gain of function but rather disrupts normal function.
- **B)** Protein degradation is not explicitly mentioned as a consequence of mutation Y. While misfolded proteins can sometimes be degraded, the dominant-negative nature of Y suggests it primarily disrupts dimerization rather than directly causing degradation.
- **C)** A wild-type phenotype would require functional dimerization, which is impossible in the presence of mutation Y. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
- **D)** Mutation Y likely causes protein aggregation due to improper dimerization, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. This aligns with the dominant-negative mechanism, where mutant subunits disrupt the function of wild-type subunits.

The most plausible outcome is that mutation Y causes protein aggregation and results in a loss-of-function phenotype due to the inability of the transcription factor to dimerize and activate gene transcription.

Answer: D
