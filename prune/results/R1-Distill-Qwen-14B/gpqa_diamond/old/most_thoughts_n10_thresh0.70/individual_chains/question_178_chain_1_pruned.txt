Okay, so I have this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γμ, γν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, right. The mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important because it tells us about renormalizability. A renormalizable theory has all terms in the Lagrangian with mass dimension ≤4. So each term's mass dimension should be ≤4.

First, I should find the mass dimension of each field and coupling in the term. Let's break down each part.

In 4-dimensional spacetime, the fields have certain mass dimensions. Fermion fields like ψ are dimension 3/2. The Dirac adjoint ψ̄ would also be 3/2.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. The field strength tensor F^{μν} for electromagnetism, for example, has dimension 2, because the gauge field Aμ has dimension 1, and F is the derivative of A with another derivative, so 1 +1 =2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In QED, the gauge field Aμ has mass dimension 1. The field strength tensor F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative brings a dimension of 1, and A is dim 1. So each term in F is ∂A, so dimension 2. So F has dimension 2.

Now, the σ_{μν} term is (i/2)[γμ, γν], which is antisymmetric. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices. So [γμ, γν] is dimensionless, so σ is dimensionless as well.

So putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 =3. Then, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is still 3.

Then F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the whole term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, which has dimension 3 +2 =5.

But wait, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Because in 4D, the action is ∫ d^4x L, so the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4 to make the action dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So the term here is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) + 2.

Adding those up: [κ] + (3/2 +3/2) = [κ] +3, plus 2 gives [κ] +5. But this has to equal 4 because the Lagrangian is dimension 4.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That narrows it down to options A or C.

Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. If the coupling's dimension is ≤4 in 4D, the theory is renormalizable. Wait, no: actually, in 4D, a renormalizable interaction has each term in the Lagrangian with dimension ≤4, but the coupling's dimension is [κ] = 4 - sum of fields.

Wait, maybe I should think about the general rule: in 4D, a term with coupling κ in the Lagrangian must have [κ] ≥ 0 because otherwise, the term would have negative dimension, which implies that the interaction is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling in a renormalizable interaction can't be positive; it must
