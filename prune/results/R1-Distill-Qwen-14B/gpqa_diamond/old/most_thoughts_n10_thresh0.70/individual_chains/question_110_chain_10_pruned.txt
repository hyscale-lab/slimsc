Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including star studies.

The key here is to understand the magnitude limits of each spectrograph. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, so that means it can detect stars down to about 17th magnitude. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so it can go a bit fainter—up to 16 mag.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. The way it's worded is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh, wait, I think I might be getting this backwards. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So a star with a V magnitude of 17 is dimmer than one with 16. So if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can detect stars with V magnitudes up to 17—brighter than that. Similarly, HIRES can go up to 16 mag. So HIRES can detect fainter stars than ESPRESSO, because it can go to 16, while ESPRESSO stops at 17.

Wait, no, that's not right. If the magnitude is higher, the star is dimmer. So for example, a star at 17 mag is dimmer than one at 16. So, the ESPRESSO can see stars with V <=17 (since they are brighter than 17). Wait, no, the statement says, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, so if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's within the observable range. So a star with apparent V magnitude of 17 is at the limit—so it's included or excluded?

Wait, I think in astronomy, when they say "brighter than X," they include X

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both.

First, I remember that the question gives some key info about the brightness each spectrograph can handle. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So the stars must have an apparent V magnitude that's brighter than 16 (since HIRES is brighter, so the stricter limit is 16) but wait, no, wait: wait, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, meaning it can see fainter stars than HIRES. Wait, no, the brighter the star (lower magnitude number), the easier to observe. So both instruments can observe stars brighter than their respective limits. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because HIRES can only see up to 16, so any star fainter than that (like 17) can't be seen by HIRES. So the star must be apparent V mag ≤16, right?

Wait, no, let me think again. Because, if a star is brighter (apparent V magnitude is lower, say 15), then both can observe. But if a star is 16.5 mag, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't because it's brighter than 16. So the star's apparent V magnitude has to be <=16 to be detected by both. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16, so any star that's 17 or fainter would not be observable by HIRES, even if ESPRESSO can see it.

Wait, the problem says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag."

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Hmm, wait, because in astronomy, higher magnitudes mean fainter objects. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, then it's brighter than 17. So the stars observed by ESPRESSO are those with V <=17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. So stars must have V <=16 to be observed by HIRES.

So, a star can be observed by both only if its apparent V magnitude is <=16. Because any star with V mag >16 would be beyond HIRES's capability, even if ESPRESSO can see it.

So now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust reddening) that affects it.

Wait, the question says for Star3 and Star4, there's E(B-V) which is color excess. The total absorption in V band is calculated with a coefficient of 3.1, so I think that's the formula: Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). Because the extinction in V is Av, which affects the apparent magnitude.

So apparent magnitude is the absolute magnitude plus distance modulus, plus extinction.

Wait, no. The formula is: apparent magnitude (m) = absolute magnitude (M) + distance modulus (5 log10 d - 5) + Av. Because Av is the extinction (which makes the star appear fainter, so higher m).

Wait, no. Let me think: the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10 (d
