Okay, so I've just started this job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The PI gave me four plasmid options, and I need to choose the right one. 

Hmm, the amino acid sequence provided is for Human P53. I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid should contain a strong promoter, the gene with appropriate RBS, and possibly a tag for purification. Oh right, usually the cloning vector has a promoter like T7 because BL21 strains are T7 RNA polymerase-deficient, so they require an inducible system, often using IPTG.

Looking at the options, each starts with ATG, which is the start codon. But I need to make sure that the plasmid is correctly designed for E. coli expression. The plasmid should have the T7 promoter before the start codon. Let me check the sequences.

Option A: The beginning looks like ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCCGCATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGCGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Each option is a DNA sequence starting with ATG. I'm looking for the presence of the T7 promoter, which is usually a specific sequence like T7GAGCTG before the start codon. Let me see. Looking at the start of each plasmid.

Option A: The first part is ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAG... So the first codon is ATG (which is correct), but what's before that? After ATG comes GAGGAG... Wait, the promoter should be upstream. Oh, wait, the plasmid's coding sequence starts with ATG, but the promoter is in the vector before that. But in the given sequences, the plasmids don't have any promoter sequences. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, these might be the actual coding regions, perhaps without the promoter.

Wait, another approach: the correct plasmid should have the correct reading frame and the correct start codon, and perhaps an RBS (ribosome binding site) before the ATG. But looking at the sequences, the first few nucleotides after the ATG are GAGGAG... so the start is ATG followed by GAG, which is Glu. That's correct for the start of the P53 sequence.

But I'm more concerned about the presence of a T7 promoter in the plasmid. Let me look for the T7 promoter sequence. The T7 promoter is typically a specific sequence, often something like T7 followed by GGAGCTG or similar. Wait, the T7 promoter is recognized by T7 RNA polymerase, which in the plasmid would be part of the vector, not the insert. But since the options are the insert sequences, perhaps the presence of the T7 promoter is in the vector, which is not shown here. So maybe the question is about the correct multiple cloning site (MCS) orientation, and whether the insert is in frame, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the correct plasmid includes the T7 promoter as part of the sequence. Wait, looking at the options, each starts with ATG, which is the start codon. But the promoter would come before that in the plasmid. So perhaps the sequences provided in the options do not include the promoter, but the question is about the presence of the correct ORF, including the ATG followed by the correct sequence.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the presence of a stop codon. Because when expressing a protein in E. coli, the plasmid should have the coding sequence without a stop codon unless you want a fusion protein or include a tag. Alternatively, sometimes the cloning process might include a stop codon after the gene, so the vector doesn't have another one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether the plasmid includes the correct RBS and start codon. But all options start with ATG, so that's correct.

Wait, another thought. The pET series vectors (commonly used in BL21) have a T7 promoter, followed by the MCS, then the ATG start codon. So the insert should be cloned into the MCS in frame. So the insert should have the ATG in the correct reading frame.

Looking at the options, perhaps the difference lies in whether the stop codon is present. If the plasmid includes a stop codon after the gene, then when expressed, the protein would terminate correctly. But the given amino acid sequence is the entire P53, so perhaps the plasmid should not include a stop codon, as the expression vector typically doesn't include it unless you're using a specific system.

Wait, perhaps the presence of a stop codon in the plasmid's DNA is important. Let's think: in the DNA sequence, a stop codon would be TAG, TGA, or TAA. Looking at the end of each option.

Looking at option A: ...TGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

The last part is ACTGA. Wait, the last three nucleotides are TGA, which is a stop codon. So option A has a TGA at the end.

Option B: Ends with ...TTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA. So same as A, ends with TGA.

Option C: Ends with ...TGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA. Same as A and B.

Option D: Ends with ...TGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA. Also same as others.

Hmm, all options end with TGA. So perhaps that's not the differentiator.

Wait, maybe I should look for the presence of a T7 promoter in the plasmid. Since all the options start with ATG, perhaps the question is about the cloning direction. For E. coli expression, the insert should be cloned in the correct orientation with respect to the T7 promoter. So the ATG should be after the promoter.

Looking at each option, the very start is ATG. So if the promoter is upstream, then the ATG should be following the promoter. So the sequences here may all have the correct orientation, but perhaps one of them has an additional start codon or a frame issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is whether the plasmid has an in-frame ATG. For example, in the MCS, the cloning site could be in a certain frame, and the insert must be cloned in the same frame to have the correct reading.

But without knowing the MCS, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of an RBS sequence is important. The RBS is usually a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (like AGGAGG) before the ATG. Looking at the start of each option.

Option A: Starts with ATG GAG GAG CGC... So the sequence after ATG is GAG, which is Glu. The RBS is usually before the ATG. But in the sequences given, the start is ATG, so perhaps the RBS is part of the vector, not the insert.

Wait, maybe the correct plasmid doesn't have an internal ribosome entry site or an RBS within the insert. If the insert has an RBS, it could interfere. But all start with ATG, so perhaps that's not it.

Another approach: the given amino acid sequence starts with Met (MEEPQSDPSV...), which corresponds to the start codon ATG. So the plasmid must have ATG as the first codon, which all options do.

Wait
