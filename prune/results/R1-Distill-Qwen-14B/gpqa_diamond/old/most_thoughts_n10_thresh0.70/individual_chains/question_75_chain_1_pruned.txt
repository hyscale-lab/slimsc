Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using an inducible overexpression model. To do this, they've modified the gene by adding the coding sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So, the construct should produce a fusion protein where the HA tag is at the beginning of GADD45G.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, which is a common method for transfecting cells with plasmid DNA. They selected for antibiotic resistance, so the construct must have a resistance gene. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So something's wrong with the construct.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, let's see what's going on. The sequence is the plus strand, which is the sense strand, meaning it's the same as the mRNA except T instead of U. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. HA is a small peptide, right? Its coding sequence would be added right after the start codon. But looking at the given sequence, does it start with the HA coding sequence?

Wait, in the provided sequence, the first part after ATG is TAC. Let me think. The HA tag is usually a specific sequence. The HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. The corresponding DNA would be something like TAC TAT GTA CTT GAT TAC GCT ACA (just an example). But looking at the given sequence, after ATG, it's TAC CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

So the beginning is ATG TAC ... Hmm. Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the construct should start with the HA sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence. But in the given DNA, after ATG, the next codon is TAC, which is Tyrosine. That doesn't seem to be part of the HA tag, which starts with Tyr (TAC), but the HA sequence is longer.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is part of this. Let's think: the HA tag is a specific peptide, so the DNA sequence should encode that. Let me recall, the HA tag is derived
