Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And I need to find the partition function Z. The options are labeled A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Where β is 1/(kT). So each state has its own energy E, and I sum exp(-βE) for all possible configurations.

But with three spins, each can be +1 or -1. So the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So there are 8 possible states for S1, S2, S3. But maybe some of these states have the same energy, so I can group them.

Let me list all possible states. Each spin is either +1 or -1. So the possible states are all combinations: (++, +, +), (++, +, -), and so on. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count how many states have a certain number of neighboring pairs aligned or anti-aligned.

Wait, the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term. Let's think of each term as S_i S_j. Each S_i is either +1 or -1, so S_i S_j is +1 if they're the same, -1 if different.

So each of the three terms (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3) can be +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, let me think: for three terms, each +1 or -1, the sum can be any odd number from -3 to +3.

Wait let's see. Let's assume all three terms are +1: sum is 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, sum is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, sum is -1. If all three are -1, sum is -3.

Wait, but wait
