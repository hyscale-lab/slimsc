Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Alright, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The operator σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. So, H is a 2x2 matrix because it's a spin-½ system.

Eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix... wait, for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found from the trace and determinant. Alternatively, I remember that the Pauli matrices have some properties. Each Pauli matrix squared gives the identity matrix. Because σ · n is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with n, maybe it's similar to the Pauli matrices themselves.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σ · n. Oh right! The general form for the eigenvalues of a spin operator in a magnetic field, or any such Hamiltonian. I think σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because the trace would be zero, and the determinant would be -1. So the eigenvalues would satisfy λ^2 = -1, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you have σ · n, the eigenvalues are ±1 multiplied by some factor. Wait, the operator σ · n would have a magnitude equal to sqrt(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) times some factor? But since n is a unit vector, that magnitude is 1. So each component is scaled by the direction of n. But when you find the eigenvalues of σ · n, what do you get?

Alternatively, think about the operator σ · n. The square of
