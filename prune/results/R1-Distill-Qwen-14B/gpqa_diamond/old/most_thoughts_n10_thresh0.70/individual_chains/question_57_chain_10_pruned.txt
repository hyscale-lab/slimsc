Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember from my notes that elastic scattering involves the collision where the kinetic energy isn't lost, so the particles just change direction but keep the same speed. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details here.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67 degrees, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. They also mention to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. So I suppose I'll only consider these five.

The main task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, scattering amplitude is a concept from quantum mechanics, right? I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the differential cross-section. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum over l ( (2l + 1) * (δ_l) / (sin δ_l) ) * ... wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, let me think again. The scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave expansion has a form that includes the phase shifts. For each partial wave l, there's a term involving (2l + 1) and the phase shift δ_l. Specifically, the scattering amplitude's imaginary part along the direction of the incident beam would be when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees. Because along the beam direction, θ=0.

So, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude Im f(0) is what we're after. From what I remember, the expression for Im f(0) is given by summing over all the partial waves l, each contributing (2l + 1) multiplied by the sine of the phase shift δ_l, all multiplied by some factors.

Wait, I think the formula is:

Im f(θ) = (1/(k)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) * (sin δ_l) * P_l(cos θ)

where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But when θ is 0, cos θ = 1, and P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the formula simplifies because all the Legendre polynomials at θ=0 are 1. Therefore, Im f(0) becomes:

Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) sin δ_l

Wait, but I'm not sure about the 1/k factor. Let me recall the exact formula. Oh right, another approach: the scattering amplitude f is given in terms of the partial waves as:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ (e^{i δ_l} - 1) / (i k) ) ] P_l (cos θ )

So, the term (e^{i δ_l} - 1) can be rewritten. Let's compute that. e^{i δ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So subtracting 1 gives (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l. Then, divide by i k:

[ (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ] / (i k) 

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i), so:

[ (cos δ_l -1)(-i) + sin δ_l ] / k 

Which simplifies to:

[ ( -i (cos δ_l -1) ) + sin δ_l ] / k 

But when we take the imaginary part of f(θ), it's the imaginary part of each term in the sum. So for each l, the contribution is (sin δ_l) / k multiplied by (2l + 1), because the other parts are real or imaginary.

Wait, let me think again. The term (e^{i δ} - 1) / (ik) can be simplified:

(e^{i δ} - 1) = e^{i δ/2} (e^{i
