Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

First, I think I should figure out the moles of each acid and base involved. Because when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, right? HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Also, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. So, maybe I need to consider all the H+ and OH- sources.

Let me calculate each solution's moles:

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

For HCl:
Molarity 0.2 M, volume 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH⁻ per formula unit, so moles of OH⁻ = 2 * (0.3 * 0.3) = 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. Also, the CH3COOH will contribute H+ but it's weak, so maybe it won't react as much? Or maybe it's just part of the excess after neutralization.

So, let's think about the neutralization first. The strong acid and strong base will react completely. HCl provides H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 provides OH-.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. Total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. So the OH- is in excess. The neutralization will use up 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. The total solution volume would be the sum of all three solutions. So 500 + 400 + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

After the H+ and OH- neutralization, we have excess OH- (0.10 moles) and also the CH3COOH which is a weak acid. But wait, when we have excess OH- in solution, it's a basic solution. So the OH- will react with the weak acid as well.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ in solution. The OH- will react with this H+.

The reaction would be: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, how much OH- is left after reacting with CH3COOH?

We have 0.10 moles of OH- from before. The CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. So OH- will neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate (CH3COO^-).

So after this reaction, the OH- remaining would be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. That might not be accurate because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it fully dissociates. The HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it only partially dissociates. But when we mix the solution, the strong OH- will deprotonate the weak acid.

So the initial neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2: HCl is 0.08 mol H+; Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol OH-. So 0.08 moles of OH- are used, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-. Then, this OH- will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. So OH- (0.10) will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate, and the OH- left is 0.05 moles.

So the total solution volume is 1.2 L, right? So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. So pH would be 14 - 1
