Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about evaluating a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. Hmm, I remember this has to do with vector calculus, specifically the divergence theorem maybe.

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, I think the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector in spherical coordinates. Because it's radial, the components in the angular directions (theta and phi) are zero.

The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of f inside a sphere of radius R. So, I need to compute ∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of the sphere.

Wait, I recall from my notes that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates can be a bit tricky. The general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/ sinθ) d/dφ (A_φ) ), but since our field only has the radial component, the other terms are zero. So, ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). 

Since f_r is 1/r², let's plug that in. So f_r = 1/r². Then, the divergence becomes (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Let me compute the expression inside the derivative first. r² * (1/r²) is 1, right? So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = (1/r²)(0) = 0. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero, the integral would be zero. But wait, what about the origin? Because the field is 1/r², which suggests it might have a singularity at r=0.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the divergence. Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait. Let me re-calculate the divergence correctly.

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) 

f_r is 1/r², so r² f_r is r² * (1/r²) = 1. Taking the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So yes, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But wait, the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin. So the integral would be zero?

But wait, another approach comes to mind—the divergence theorem. It says that the volume integral of the divergence of f is equal to the surface integral of f · n over the boundary surface, where n is the outward normal. In this case, the boundary is the sphere of radius R.

So, according to the divergence theorem, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA.

But wait, f is radial, and n on the sphere is also radial. So, f · n is (1/R²) *
