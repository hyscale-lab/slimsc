Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question involves two reactions done by an organic chemist. Reaction I uses (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. Reaction II uses pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 and then acidic workup. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks the chemist would observe in each.

Hmm, I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. LAH is LiAlH4, right? And NaBH4 is another reducing agent but maybe less strong. Also, in acidic workup, any remaining reducing agents or intermediates would be protonated.

Let me think about Reaction I first. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure of this compound is a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on carbon 3 and a methoxy group on carbon 5. The configuration is S, which might be important for the stereochemistry in the product.

When you reduce a ketone with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, the ketone (RCOR') becomes a secondary alcohol (RCH(OH)R'). So, hexan-3-one would become 3-hexanol. But wait, wait. Wait, the structure is hexan-3-one, so carbon 3 is the ketone. So, upon reduction, it would become 3-hexanol. Also, the methoxy group is on carbon 5. So, the molecule would be 5-methoxy-3-hexanol, but wait, wait: the starting material is (S)-configuration, so the product will have a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait a second. The starting compound is a ketone, and when reduced, the product is an alcohol. Does the configuration matter for the ketone? Because ketones are planar, so the configuration might not be relevant, but wait, no, the starting material is a chiral center? Wait, wait. Let me think again. The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Hexan-3-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is six carbons. Carbon 3 is the ketone. So, the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe it's better to draw it.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So carbon 5 is the third from the ketone? Wait, carbon numbering: 1, 2, 3 (ketone), 4, 5 (methoxy), 6.

So, structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Or maybe the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine it as:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is:

CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, because if it's 3, the carbonyl is on the third carbon, so the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me just think that for the purpose of this problem, the exact structure isn't as crucial as the reaction outcome.

So, when (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, the ketone (at C3) is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product would be 3-hexanol with a methoxy group on C5. Wait, but wait, the starting material is a ketone, so the product will have an alcohol group on C3. So, the product is 3-hexanol but with a substituent on C5.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone, you add two hydrogens. So, the R-C(=O)-R' becomes R-CH(OH)-R' after initial reduction, but then during workup, it's protonated. Wait, no, wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and it's typically done in an ethereal solution. So, the ketone is converted to an alcohol.

So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but the starting material's configuration is S. Wait, no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Wait, but the ketone is at C3. So, the configuration at C5 would be S? Because the starting material is (S) configuration.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the structure. The compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is (S)-configured. So, the molecule is (S) at C5. So, let's imagine the structure: the main chain is six carbons, with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5.

So, C5 has a methoxy group attached. The configuration at C5 is S. When we reduce the ketone at C3, the C3 becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product is 5-methoxy-3-hexanol, but with the configuration at C5 still S.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone, the C of the carbonyl group is a trigonal planar sp2 hybridized carbon. So, the substituents on either side are the same or different. When you reduce it to an alcohol, the C becomes sp3, and depending on the starting structure, the configuration can form a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait, wait. The starting ketone is (S)-configured. Hmm, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. That means the center with the substituents is at C5. Because hexan-3-one is a ketone at C3, so the groups attached to C5 are: CH2CH2-OCH3, CH(CH2CH2CH3), etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the C5 as the stereogenic center.

So, C5 has four different groups: a methoxy group (OCH3), a CH2 group (from C4), a CH2 group (from C6), and the CH group from C3. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to draw it.

The structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2CH2-OCH3)-CH2CH3.

No, wait, maybe the correct structure is:

The main chain is six carbons. The ketone is on C3. So carbons are:

1: CH3

2: CH2

3: C=O

4: CH2

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH3

Wait, that makes the structure more like (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the groups attached to C5 are: OCH3, CH2 (from C4), CH2 (from C6), and the adjacent C3 (which has the carbonyl). So, C5 is a stereogenic center with four different substituents, hence the (S) configuration.

When we reduce the ketone at C3 with LAH, the C3 becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product is 3-hexanol derivative, but with the methoxy group on C5. So, the product is 5-methoxy-3-hexanol, and the configuration at C5 remains S because the reduction doesn't affect C5.

So, after Reaction I, we have (S)-5-methoxy-3-hexanol. Wait, but wait, when a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, does the stereogenic center at C3 form any new stereoisomers? Because the starting ketone is planar. So, the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol would produce a racemic mixture if the starting material was not chiral. But in this case, the starting material is chiral at C5, but the C3, the site of reduction, is not a stereogenic center before reduction.

Wait, wait, the starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The C3 is a carbonyl group, so it's sp2 hybridized. When reduced, it becomes an sp3 hybridized carbon with an OH group. So, in the product, C3 is a stereogenic center.

Ah, right! Because when you reduce a planar sp2 center to an sp3, you can get a new stereogenic center. But since LAH is a strong reducing agent that does a complete reduction, and the reaction is under specific conditions, the product can form two possible stereoisomers: R and S at C3. Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5. Does that affect the configuration at C3?

Wait, no, because the starting material's configuration is at C5, not C3. So, when you reduce C3, which was a trigonal planar carbon, it becomes a tetrahedral carbon with four different substituents. So, the product would be a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) at C3. But wait, wait, because the reaction is done with a chiral starting material, can the product have some kind of induced asymmetry? Or perhaps, since the starting material is chiral, the product could have a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, no, I don't think so. The reaction at C3 is a ketone (sp2) being reduced to an alcohol (sp3), which introduces a new stereogenic center. But the reaction conditions (LAH in ether, followed by acidic workup) usually lead to the formation of a racemic mixture unless some kind of asymmetric induction is present. But since the starting material is chiral, perhaps the reaction leads to some diastereoselectivity? Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is stereospecific but without any induced configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed under the assumption that the reduction of the ketone with LAH produces a racemic mixture at the new stereogenic center. But wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so perhaps the product's configuration at C3 isn't determined by the starting material's configuration at C5. So, the product would be a 50:50 mixture of R and S at C3, but the C5 remains S.

But wait, wait again. The C5 is already a stereogenic center with (S) configuration. The reduction at C3 creates a new stereogenic center. So, the product would have two stereogenic centers: C3 and C5. And if the reduction is racemic at C3, then the product would be a mixture of four diastereomers, but perhaps only two enantiomers.

Wait, no. Because each diastereomer would have a specific configuration at both centers. If C3 is R or S, and C5 is S, then the possible configurations are:

(R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5, respectively. But wait, no, because in the starting material, C5 is S. The product's C5 would remain the same as the starting material's C5, because the reduction is at C3. So, the product's C5 is still S.

So, the product would be a diastereomeric mixture, but only at C3. Because C5 is fixed as S. So, the product would have two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5, respectively. Wait, but wait, no, because the starting material is (S) at C5, the product's C5 remains (S). So, the product's C3 is either R or S, making two possible stereoisomers.

Therefore, Reaction I produces two products: (R)-5-methoxy-3-hexanol and (S)-5-methoxy-3-hexanol. Or maybe not? Wait, wait, but wait. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the ketone group is being reduced. The reaction at C3 would introduce a new stereogenic center, leading to two possible configurations, R and S. So, the product would be a racemic mixture, meaning equal amounts of both enantiomers.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so perhaps the product would have some kind of diastereoselectivity. Hmm, I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to retention of configuration. Wait, but I don't think so, because the ketone is planar, and the nucleophilic attack by hydride can come from either side.

So, perhaps the product after Reaction I is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) at C3, but C5 remains (S). So, the overall product would be a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5.

Wait, but no, because the configuration at C5 is fixed as (S). So, the product would have two stereoisomers: one where C3 is R and C5 is S, and another where C3 is S and C5 is S. These are two diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → treated with LAH → becomes 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, the product is 5-methoxy-3-hexanol. Now, this molecule has two stereogenic centers: C3 and C5.

Wait, the initial compound has a stereogenic center at C5. After reduction, the C3 becomes a stereogenic center as well. So, the product is a diastereomer with both centers.

But since the reduction introduces a new stereogenic center, which can be either R or S, the product would be a mixture of two diastereomers, each having the same configuration at C5 (S) but opposite at C3. So, two diastereomers: (S,S) and (R,S).

Wait, but wait, no. Because C5 is already S in the starting material, and C3 is a new stereogenic center. So, the product has two stereogenic centers: C3 and C5. So, the possible stereoisomers are:

- C3: R, C5: S → (R,S)

- C3: S, C5: S → (S,S)

So, these are two possible stereoisomers. Thus, the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to a 1:1 ratio of (R,S) and (S,S) diastereomers. Wait, no, because a racemic mixture at C3 would mean that half are (R) and half are (S) at C3. But since C5 is fixed as (S), the diastereomers are (R,S) and (S,S), each at 50% abundance. So, the product is a 50:50 mixture of these two diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the product has a single stereogenic center. Wait, no. The product would have two stereogenic centers: the one at C3 (new) and C5 (existing). So, the product is a diastereomeric mixture of two stereoisomers.

But wait, wait. Does the product have two stereogenic centers? Let me think. The product is 5-methoxy-3-hexanol. So, the structure is a six-carbon chain with an OH on C3 and OCH3 on C5. So, the C3 has four different substituents: CH2CH2-OCH3, CH2CH2CH3, OH, and two CH2 groups? Or wait, maybe I should draw it.

Actually, I'm getting stuck on the specifics. Let me move on for a moment and think about Reaction II.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone: (CH3)COCH2COCH3. So, it's (CH3)CO–CH2–CO–CH3.

When you reduce this with NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent (though not as strong as LAH), but NaBH4 does reduce ketones. However, in the presence of excess NaBH4, perhaps both ketones are reduced.

So, each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione would be reduced to an alcohol. So, the product would be 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups, so each would be reduced.

So, the product would be (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3. So, it's 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait a second. When you have a diketone like 2,4-pentanedione, reducing it with NaBH4 would give a diol. However, considering the structure, each carbonyl is at C2 and C4. So, reducing each would give two alcohol groups: at C2 and C4.

So, the structure becomes HOCH2–CH(OH)–CH2–CH2–CH3? No, wait, 2,4-pentanediol would be HO-CH2–CH(OH)–CH2–CH2–CH3? No, that's not right. Let me think: pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons.

Pentane is five carbons. So, positions 1,2,3,4,5.

2,4-dione would have ketones on carbons 2 and 4. So, structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, it's (CH3)CO-CH2-CO-CH3. So, when you reduce both ketones, you'd get 2,4-pentanediol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but wait, that's 2 and 4 positions with OH groups. So, the molecule is HOCH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, pentane-2,4-diol would be:

CH2(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3?

Wait, no, wait. The structure would be:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3?

No, let's think again. The initial structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. After reduction, each C=O becomes CH(OH)-. So, the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the molecule is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, I think that structure is correct. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, is this molecule chiral? Let me check for stereogenic centers.

Looking at the molecule, each of the two OH-bearing carbons (C2 and C4) has four different substituents.

At C2: The groups are CH3, OH, CH2CH3 (from C3 and C4?), and the adjacent C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH2-). Wait, maybe not. Let me structure it.

The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: connected to C1 and C3. The groups are: CH3 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), OH, and the remaining bond is to C1? No, perhaps better to see:

Actually, the molecule is CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, no. Because C3 is CH2, so the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but in this structure, C2 and C4 each have what substituents?

At C2: attached groups are:

- CH3 (from C1)

- OH

- CH2- (from C3, which is connected to C4)

- and the adjacent C (which is C3, but perhaps that's not a substituent). Wait, perhaps each OH is on a CH2 group?

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, so C2 is CH(OH), connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two hydrogens? No, wait, that can't be right because each carbon must have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try drawing it more accurately.

The compound is pentane-2,4-dione: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait:

Structure:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So, positions 1,2,3,4,5.

2 and 4 positions have ketones.

So, structure:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, no, that can't be because the carbons are connected as a chain. So, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So, when reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Each of the two central carbons (C2 and C4) has the structure CH(OH). Now, looking at each of these, are they stereogenic centers?

At C2, the groups are:

- CH3 (from C1)

- OH

- CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 (from C3 and beyond)

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, wait, no. Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3

- Carbon 3: CH2

Wait, no. Let me think. The structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-H - CH2 - C(OH)-H - CH3?

No, that can't be right. Each carbonyl group is C=O, so upon reduction, each becomes CH(OH).

Wait, perhaps each of the C2 and C4 carbons has the structure CH(OH), with substituents.

So, at C2: attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), an OH group, and a hydrogen. So, four different groups: CH3, CH2 (from C3), OH, and H. Therefore, C2 is a stereogenic center.

Similarly, at C4: attached to C3 (CH2), C5 (CH3), OH, and a hydrogen. So, four different groups: CH2 (from C3), CH3 (from C5), OH, and H. Therefore, C4 is also a stereogenic center.

So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which has two stereogenic centers at C2 and C4. Now, when NaBH4 is used to reduce the diketone, what happens?

When you reduce a diketone, each ketone is reduced, but the question is whether the reduction creates a racemic mixture at each stereogenic center or if they are formed with some kind of diastereoselectivity.

NaBH4 is a reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but it doesn't have any chiral inducing properties, so each reduction would proceed without any preference, leading to racemic formation at each center.

But wait, in this case, the two stereogenic centers are in a symmetrical position. The molecule is symmetric around the center (C3). So, the reduction of each ketone would lead to both centers being either R or S, but the symmetry would influence the possible diastereomers.

Wait, let's think about the possible stereoisomers for 2,4-pentanediol.

Because of the molecule's symmetry (mirror plane through C3), the configurations at C2 and C4 must be the same. So, the two stereogenic centers are either both R, both S, or R and S.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetric, then the configuration at C2 and C4 must be either both R or both S, because changing one would require the other to change to maintain symmetry.

Let me explain. The molecule is symmetric, so if C2 is R, then C4 must also be R to maintain the mirror image. Alternatively, if C2 is S, C4 must be S.

So, the possible stereoisomers are:

1. Both C2 and C4 are R → resulting in (R,R) configuration.

2. Both C2 and C4 are S → (S,S) configuration.

But wait, are these the only possibilities? Or can they be R and S in a way that the molecule isn't symmetric?

Ah, but wait, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. So, if C2 is R and C4 is S, the molecule would not be superimposable on its mirror image, making it a different stereoisomer. But that would violate the symmetry.

Wait, no, because if C2 is R and C4 is S, the molecule would actually be identical to its mirror image because of the symmetry. Hmm, wait, maybe not. Let me think about this.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then the configuration at C2 and C4 must mirror each other. So, if C2 is R, C4 must be S, or vice versa, but that would not be possible because of the plane of symmetry. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, consider that each stereogenic center is independent. So, each can be R or S. But because of the molecule's symmetry, if C2 is R, C4 must be R as well, and if C2 is S, C4 must be S as well. So, there are two possible enantiomers: (R,R) and (S,S), which are themselves enantiomers, making the product a racemic mixture of these two.

Wait, but wait: 2,4-pentanediol has two stereogenic centers, so four possible stereoisomers in theory. But due to the internal plane of symmetry, some of them are identical.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think: the molecule is symmetric, so if you have (R,R) and (S,S), they are enantiomers. But if you have (R,S) and (S,R), they would actually be the same as (R,R) and (S,S) because of the symmetry. Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is meso. Because if the molecule has a plane of symmetry and the stereogenic centers are mirror images, then the molecule could be a meso compound.

Wait, yes! 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound. Because it has a plane of symmetry (through the central C3), the configurations at C2 and C4 are mirror images. So, the molecule is achiral. So, the product after Reaction II is a meso compound, which is not chiral.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is meso, then the product is a single compound with two stereogenic centers but overall achiral. Because the two stereogenic centers have opposite configurations, making the molecule symmetric and thus achiral.

Wait, but in this case, when you reduce the diketone, which is also symmetric, you end up with a meso compound. So, the product is a single compound, not a mixture. Because the reduction leads to the formation of a single stereoisomer, which is the meso form.

Wait, but that depends on the reaction conditions. If the reduction leads to racemic formation, then for each stereogenic center, you get a 50:50 mixture. But due to the symmetry, perhaps the two stereogenic centers' configurations are fixed relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a single product because the two centers are formed in a way that the molecule remains symmetric.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again: pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric. When you reduce both ketones, you get 2,4-pentanediol, which is also symmetric. So, the product is a meso compound, meaning it has two stereogenic centers but is achiral.

So, in Reaction II, the product is a single compound: meso-2,4-pentanediol.

So, after Reaction II, the product is this meso compound, which is a single stereoisomer and not chiral.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the product from Reaction II is a single compound.

So, the products from the two reactions are:

Reaction I: 5-methoxy-3-hexanol, which has two stereogenic centers (C3 and C5), making it a diastereomeric mixture of two stereoisomers (each 50% abundance).

Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol, a single compound.

So, when the two products are combined, we have:

From Reaction I: two diastereomers (each 50% of the mixture from Reaction I).

From Reaction II: one compound (meso).

So, the combined mixture has three components: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the meso compound from Reaction II.

Now, when these are run on an HPLC column, what happens?

First, normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, with more polar compounds eluting later (or earlier, depending on the mobile phase). But in normal-phase HPLC, the stationary phase is polar (like silica), and the mobile phase is non-polar. So, more polar compounds have higher retention times.

But in this case, the question is about the number of peaks. Each distinct compound would give a separate peak.

But wait, the product from Reaction II is a meso compound and is not chiral. The products from Reaction I are two diastereomers, each of which is a separate compound.

So, in the combined mixture, we have:

- 5-methoxy-3-hexanol (R,S configuration)

- 5-methoxy-3-hexanol (S,S configuration)

- meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers in equal amounts. So, each is 50% of Reaction I's product.

So, when combined with Reaction II's product (meso), the total mixture has three distinct compounds.

Now, when run on a normal-phase HPLC column, each of these three would elute as separate peaks. So, three peaks.

But wait, wait. Let me think: the normal-phase HPLC would separate compounds based on their polarity. The meso compound is 2,4-pentanediol, which is more polar than the 3-hexanol derivatives because it has two hydroxyl groups, perhaps. Wait, 3-hexanol has one OH, while pentane-2,4-diol has two OHs. So, the diols would be more polar.

Wait, but how does that affect the separation? Let me think: the two diastereomers from Reaction I are both 5-methoxy-3-hexanol, but with different configurations. Are they enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, the two diastereomers from Reaction I are (R,S) and (S,S). Because they have different configurations, they are diastereomers and have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times on the normal-phase HPLC.

The meso compound from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a different compound altogether. So, in normal-phase HPLC, we would see three separate peaks: two from Reaction I (the diastereomers) and one from Reaction II (meso).

Wait, but wait, I'm being told that the products from both reactions are combined, and then run on the HPLCs. So, the total number of peaks on normal-phase (which is non-chiral) would be three. Because each compound is distinct.

But wait, perhaps the 5-methoxy-3-hexanol diastereomers might have the same retention time on normal-phase HPLC if their physical properties are similar. But I think diastereomers usually have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times. So, each would be a separate peak.

So, normal-phase HPLC would show three peaks: the two diastereomers (each from Reaction I) and the meso compound (from Reaction II).

Wait, but wait. How about the chiral HPLC column? Chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers and diastereomers based on their interaction with the chiral stationary phase.

So, when the mixture is run on a chiral column, each enantiomer or diastereomer that has a different interaction with the stationary phase would elute as separate peaks.

Let me think about each component:

1. Reaction I diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S) configurations. Are these enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, they are diastereomers because they have different configurations at C3. So, on a chiral column, diastereomers are separated, so each would give a separate peak.

2. Reaction II's meso compound: since it's a meso compound, it's achiral. So, on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak because it doesn't have any chiral interactions (it doesn't have a chiral center that interacts with the stationary phase). Wait, no. Wait, the meso compound has two stereogenic centers but is achiral, so it would have the same interaction as a non-chiral compound. So, on a chiral column, it might not be retained as much as the chiral compounds, and would come out as a single peak.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Some chiral columns may cause even achiral compounds to interact, but typically, achiral compounds would elute quickly, but as a single peak.

So, for the chiral HPLC:

- The two diastereomers from Reaction I would each produce a peak. So, two peaks.

- The meso compound from Reaction II would produce another peak. So, a third peak.

Wait, but wait another thing. The two diastereomers from Reaction I are both chiral, so on a chiral column, they would be separated into two peaks. The meso compound is not chiral, so it would elute as a single peak, perhaps earlier than the others.

So, in total, on the chiral column, we would have three peaks: two from the diastereomers and one from the meso compound.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again.

Another approach: the number of peaks on each HPLC depends on how many distinct compounds there are. Since the normal-phase HPLC is achiral, it doesn't distinguish between enantiomers. So, if any enantiomers are present, they would co-elute. But diastereomers would have different retention times.

The chiral HPLC, on the other hand, would separate enantiomers and diastereomers.

So, for Reaction I's products, which are two diastereomers (each a chiral compound), and Reaction II's product, which is a meso (achiral) compound.

So, in the combined mixture:

- Two diastereomers (each chiral) from Reaction I.

- One meso compound from Reaction II.

In normal-phase HPLC: achiral. So, each diastereomer would be a separate peak. The meso compound is a different compound, so another peak. So, three peaks in total.

In chiral HPLC: the two diastereomers would each be separated into their own peaks. The meso compound, being achiral, would not be separated into enantiomers and would elute as a single peak. So, three peaks in total.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The two diastereomers from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they would elute at different times on the chiral column. The meso compound is a single compound, so it's one peak. So, three peaks.

So, on both HPLC columns, three peaks would be observed. But wait, looking back at the options, option D says 3 peaks in both cases.

But wait, in the normal-phase HPLC, the two diastereomers would be separate, and the meso compound would be another, so three peaks. On the chiral column, the two diastereomers would be separated (two peaks), and the meso would be another (third). So, both give three peaks, which would make the answer D.

But wait, that's conflicting with my earlier assumption.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure.

Reaction I's product: two diastereomers.

Reaction II's product: one meso compound.

So, combined, three compounds.

On normal-phase HPLC: all three would be separated, so three peaks.

On chiral HPLC: the two diastereomers would be separated (two peaks), and the meso compound (which is a single, achiral compound) would elute as a single peak. So, three peaks in total.

So, both HPLC columns would show three peaks. So, the answer would be D) 3 peaks in both cases.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is "3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC".

But earlier, I thought that maybe the diastereomers in Reaction I would each have different retention times, leading to three peaks on both.

But wait, let me think again about the meso compound in Reaction II. If the meso compound is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound, and the diastereomers from Reaction I are two, then in total, three compounds, leading to three peaks in both HPLC.

So, the correct answer would be D) 3 peaks in both cases.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the meso compound would merge with another peak, but no, it's a separate compound.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products from Reaction I.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduced to 5-methoxy-3-hexanol.

Does the reduction lead to two diastereomers (R,S and S,S) or just one?

Wait, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, meaning both R and S configurations at C3, each at 50% with the same configuration at C5 (S). So, two diastereomers.

So, Reaction I gives two diastereomers, each 50% of the product.

So, the combined products after both reactions are three compounds:

1. Diastereomer 1 from Reaction I: (R,S)

2. Diastereomer 2 from Reaction I: (S,S)

3. Meso compound from Reaction II.

So, three distinct compounds.

On normal-phase HPLC: each would elute as a separate peak → three peaks.

On chiral HPLC: diastereomers would separate into two peaks, and the meso into one → three peaks.

So, both would show three peaks, making option D correct.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is "3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC".

But let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 and 4.

B) 3 and 2.

C) 4 and 2.

D) 3 and 3.

Yes, D is 3 peaks in both.

So, the correct answer is D.


The problem involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist, followed by analysis of the combined products using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reaction conditions**: Reduction with LAH followed by acidic workup.
- **Outcome**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol, forming 5-methoxy-3-hexanol. This introduces a new stereogenic center at C3. Since the starting material is chiral at C5, the product is a racemic mixture of two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5, respectively.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting material**: Pentane-2,4-dione.
- **Reaction conditions**: Reduction with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.
- **Outcome**: The two ketones at C2 and C4 are reduced to alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

### Combined Products:
- From **Reaction I**: Two diastereomers (50% each) of 5-methoxy-3-hexanol: (R,S) and (S,S).
- From **Reaction II**: A single achiral meso compound (2,4-pentanediol).

Thus, the combined mixture contains **three distinct compounds**:
1. (R,S)-5-methoxy-3-hexanol.
2. (S,S)-5-methoxy-3-hexanol.
3. Meso-2,4-pentanediol.

### Analysis on HPLC Columns:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - This technique separates compounds based on polarity. The two diastereomers from Reaction I are distinct compounds and will elute as separate peaks. The meso compound from Reaction II is a distinct compound and will also elute as a separate peak.
   - **Total peaks**: 3.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Chiral columns separate enantiomers and diastereomers. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will elute as separate peaks. The meso compound, being achiral, will also elute as a single peak.
   - **Total peaks**: 3.

### Conclusion:
Both the normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks** in total.
