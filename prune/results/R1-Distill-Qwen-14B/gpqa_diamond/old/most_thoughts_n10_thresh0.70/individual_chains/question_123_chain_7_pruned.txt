Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to break this down.

The question says that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in reality, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at that speed. So, the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Got it.

We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh right, because time can differ between frames due to relativity. But wait, is this a relativistic effect or is it just a straightforward velocity multiplied by time?

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and galaxy are inertial frames. So maybe we can use the time dilation formula here. But wait, time dilation is when the moving clock runs slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame?

Let me think. The speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second to use SI units. Oh wait, no, maybe we can work in km and seconds. Let's see.

First, the speed v is 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's super highâ€”like a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about
