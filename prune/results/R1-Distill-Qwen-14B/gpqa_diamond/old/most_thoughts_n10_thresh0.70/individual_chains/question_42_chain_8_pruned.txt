Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets and their orbital periods. I remember that the TTV method is used to detect exoplanets through transit timing variations, but I don't think that directly affects the orbital period calculation here. The question gives me some ratios of equilibrium temperatures and masses between the planets and asks about the orbital period ratio.

So, the planets are Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3, each with circular orbits. The given data is:

- Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4.
- Ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T2/T3 = 2.3.
- Mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15. So, M1/M2 = 1.15.
- Between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So, M2/M3 = 1.35.
- Albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth.

We need to find by what factor Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. So, we're looking for (Period3)/(Period1) = ?

Hmm, what do I know about the orbital period of planets? Oh, Kepler's third law! That relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula for Kepler's third law is:

P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³

But wait, in this case, the problem doesn't mention the star's mass, so maybe we're assuming they all orbit the same star. Let's think about the formula in terms of the planet's semi-major axis (a), because Kepler's law says P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). If all planets are around the same star, M is the same for all, so P² ∝ a³. So P ∝ a^(3/2).

But wait, the question gives me data about equilibrium temperatures and masses. How does that tie into the semi-major axis?

Equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

Teq = [ (L(1 - a) ) / (16πσ a² D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, no, maybe I should recall the formula correctly. The equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by:

Teq = T_star * ( (R_star / (2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

Wait, T_star is the effective temperature of the star, R_star is the radius. But since the problem doesn't give us any information about the star, maybe we can relate the temperatures of the planets to their semi-major axes.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

Teq = [ ( (1 - a) * L ) / (16πσ a²) ]^(1/4)

Wait, that might not be precise. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is:

Teq =
