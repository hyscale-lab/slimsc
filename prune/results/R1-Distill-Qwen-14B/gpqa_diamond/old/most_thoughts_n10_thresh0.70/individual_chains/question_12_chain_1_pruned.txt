Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Hmm, the problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the Pi is stationary, the products must have equal and opposite momenta so their total momentum is zero. That makes sense.

So let's think about the energies and momenta. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the Pi, because it's not moving. So total energy E_initial is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the muon and neutrino have their rest masses plus kinetic energy.

The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy. The neutrino, though, I think is considered to have negligible rest mass. So for the neutrino, its energy is just its kinetic energy plus a tiny bit, but often approximated as kinetic energy. So neutrino's energy E_nu is approx K_nu.

But wait, in beta decay, neutrinos are nearly massless. So yes, E_nu ≈ K_nu.

Now, considering energy conservation: E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

E_initial = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

E_nu ≈ K_nu.

So 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

That's equation one.

But we also have to consider momentum conservation. Since the Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So p_mu = p_nu in magnitude, but opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

Now, for each particle, the energy-momentum relation holds: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Assuming c=1 units for simplicity, so E² = p² + m².

So for the muon: (105.7 + K_mu)^2 = p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2.

And for the neutrino: (K_nu)^2 = p_nu^2 + (0)^2 (since m_nu ≈ 0).

But since p_mu = p_nu in magnitude (same direction?), wait no, opposite direction. But their magnitudes are equal. So p_mu = p_nu, but in opposite directions, so p_mu = -p_nu.

Wait, but in terms of magnitude, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So from the neutrino equation: K_nu^2 = p_nu^2.

So p_nu = K_nu (since sqrt(K_nu^2) = K_nu, assuming K_nu is positive).

Similarly, p_mu^2 = (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c²)^2 = (105.7 + K_mu)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Hmm, but wait E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

Wait, no. E_mu is the total energy, which is rest energy plus kinetic. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. So in terms of units, if m_mu is in MeV/c², then E in MeV, and p in MeV/c. But perhaps in the equations, using c=1, the units get adjusted.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set c=1 for simplification, which would make E in MeV, mass in MeV/c² becomes MeV when multiplied by c², but I think that's complicating.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should express everything in units where c=1. So E^2 = p^2 + m^2, where m is in units of MeV/c², but when c=1, m becomes MeV/c², but when multiplied by c², it becomes MeV. So in that case, E in MeV, m in MeV, p in MeV.

So for the muon: E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.

E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Substituting E_mu:

(m_mu + K_mu)^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Expanding the left side: m_mu² + 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

Subtract m_mu^2 from both sides: 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = p_mu^2.

So p_mu^2 = K_mu (2 m_mu + K_mu).

Similarly for the neutrino: E_nu^2 = p_nu^2 + m_nu^2. But m_nu is negligible, so E_nu^2 ≈ p_nu^2. So E_nu ≈ p_nu.

But from momentum conservation, since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude, opposite direction), so p_mu = p_nu.

Wait, wait. Since the muon and neutrino have opposite momenta, their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So p_mu = p_nu, but in opposite directions. But for the square terms, it doesn't matter because we're squaring. So in equations, p_mu = p_nu. So from the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu.

So E_nu = p_nu.

From the muon, p_mu^2 = K_mu (2 m_mu + K_mu).

But p_mu = p_nu = E_nu.

Wait, p_mu is the momentum of the muon, which is equal in magnitude to p_nu.

So p_mu = p_nu.

So p_mu = E_nu.

So substituting p_mu into the muon's equation:

(E_nu)^2 = K_mu (2 m_mu + K_mu).

Hmm, but we also have the energy equation.

Energy equation: m_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.

So m_pi = (m_mu + K_mu) + E_nu.

But E_nu = p_mu.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to write down all the equations together.

Equations:

1. m_pi = E_mu + E_nu. (Energy conservation)

2. E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.

3. E_nu = p_mu = p_nu.

4. E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

5. E_nu^2 = p_nu^2 + m_nu^2. Since m_nu is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu.

From equation 3 and 5, E_nu = p_nu.

But from momentum conservation, since the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So p_mu = p, p_nu = p, but in opposite directions.

Wait, but in terms of magnitude, p_mu = p_nu. So E_nu = p.

So now, let's write equation 4.

E_mu^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2.

But E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.

So (m_mu + K_mu)^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2.

Expanding left side: m_mu^2 + 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2.

Cancel m_mu^2 from both sides: 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 = p^2.

From equation 1 and 2: m_pi = (m_mu + K_mu) + E_nu.

But E_nu = p.

So m_pi = m_mu + K_mu + p.

But p^2 = 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2.

Let me try
