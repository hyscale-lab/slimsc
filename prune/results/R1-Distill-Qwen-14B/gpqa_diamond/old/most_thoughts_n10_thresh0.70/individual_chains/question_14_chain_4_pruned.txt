Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and why some peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. Let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question says that when they did ChIP-seq with PFA-fixed samples and an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells, they got some peaks. But when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. I need to figure out where those peaks were most likely located.

So, first, I should remember what ChIP-seq does. It's used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. You crosslink the proteins to DNA, fragment the DNA, use an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the attached DNA, and then sequence those regions to find the binding sites.

PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker. It's commonly used to fix proteins to DNA in cells. DSG, I think, is dithiothreitol. Wait, DSG might be used as a reducing agent. Oh wait, maybe in some fixation protocols, especially for things like chromatin shearing. Alternatively, sometimes in combination with other agents. So PFA+DSG might be a different fixation approach compared to just PFA.

Wait, I recall that PFA is a methanol-based fixative that crosslinks proteins and DNA. DSG is a reducing agent, so maybe it's used to reduce disulfide bonds or something else. Oh wait, I think sometimes when you fix with PFA, the crosslinking can be really strong, making it hard to shear the chromatin. So sometimes, people use DSG in combination to help digest the crosslinks after fixation, allowing for better fragmentation.

But wait, the question is about why the peaks would disappear when using PFA+DSG. So perhaps when you have PFA alone, the crosslinking is too strong, and when you add DSG, it helps in more efficiently shearing the DNA. Or maybe the opposite? Or maybe it's about the efficiency of the crosslinking.

Alternatively, I've heard that PFA can sometimes lead to over-fixation, which might make it harder for the antibody to bind, but that's probably not the case here. Because the initial method (with only PFA) gave peaks, so the antibody worked. But when DSG is added, maybe the crosslinking is less efficient, but that
