Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when there's a chiral center present. But wait, I remember that some compounds with chiral centers might not be optically active if there's a plane of symmetry or if they have meso compounds. Okay, let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, butene is four carbons. Let me think. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait... But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, but then 2-methyl would make it Cl-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, but the configuration is Z. Optical activity in alkenes? Oh, wait, alkenes can't have chirality because they don't have a chiral center. So, even in E/Z isomerism, unless there's a chiral center, the molecule isn't chiral. So this compound probably doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, maybe not. Let me see. Let's draw it: the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which is Cl attached to the first carbon, which has a double bond from C1 to C2. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Oh wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, that's only four carbons in but-1-ene, so but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, maybe but-1-ene is
