Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis, but let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis generally involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, right? So I think it's used for ring-closing metathesis and cross metathesis, and maybe ring-opening too. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a mono-olefin, so we're probably dealing with a ring-closing metathesis if it forms a ring.

Wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)CH₂? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent means five carbons. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So, structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or is it CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So:

Carbon 1: CH₂= (since it's pent-1-ene)
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Wait, no. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So if it's 3-methyl, it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but that would make it four carbons after the double bond. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

The structure: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons. Oh wait, no,
