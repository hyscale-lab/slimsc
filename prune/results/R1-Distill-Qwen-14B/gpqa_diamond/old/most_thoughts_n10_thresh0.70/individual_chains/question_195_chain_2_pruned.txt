Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that there's a star with a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. Around this star, there's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with Earth's radius, in a circular orbit. The impact parameter of its transit is 0.2, and it has an orbital period of 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's, also in a circular orbit with the same orbital plane. We need to find the maximum orbital period of Planet B such that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what transit and occultation events mean. Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so we can't see its light, but I think that's more from the planet's perspective. Hmm, but I'm not sure how the orbital periods relate here.

Wait, the question is about both transit and occultation events happening. So for the second planet, it must pass in front of the star (transit) and also be eclipsed by the star (occultation). So both events require the planet to be on the same orbital plane, which they already share.

But why does the period matter? Oh, right, because the orbital speed depends on the period. If the second planet is moving too slowly, maybe it doesn't transit the star as seen from Earth. Wait, but they're talking about the maximum period, so perhaps there's a point where the period is such that the orbital speed is just enough for the planet to pass in front and behind the star.

Wait, maybe the key here is about the synodic period or something related to orbital periods and the ability for one planet to catch up to the other. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transit condition. For a planet to transit, the distance between the two planets must be such that they can align in front of the star. But I'm not entirely remembering the exact conditions.

Wait, let me think about transits. For a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on, which they are in this case. But the
