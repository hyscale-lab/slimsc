Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to unpack all the information given.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. I remember that in chemistry, sometimes these types of problems involve reactions that produce specific gases or precipitates, which can give clues about the substances involved.

First, Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, right? Because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is 4°C. Hmm, what solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, no, NH4Cl has a melting point around 337 K, which is higher. Or maybe something else. Wait, maybe B is water? No, water's melting point is 273 K. Oh, wait, maybe it's not water. Let me think.

Alternatively, what if B is something else. Let's think about the gas W. The clue says that W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, so the molecule is something where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So the molecular formula must satisfy that. For example, H2O has 8 protons (O is 8, H is 1 each) and neutrons: O has 8 neutrons, H has none. So total protons: 8 + 2(1) = 10. Neutrons: 8 + 0 =8. Not equal. How about CO2? Protons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 6+16=22; neutrons in CO2 would be C has 6 neutrons, O has 8 each, so 6 + 16=22. Oh, wait, that's equal! So CO2 fits the description. But wait, can CO
