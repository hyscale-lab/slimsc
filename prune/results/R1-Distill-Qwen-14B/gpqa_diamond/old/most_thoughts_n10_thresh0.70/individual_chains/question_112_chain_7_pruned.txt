Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it through carefully. So, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually represented as a column vector, and the probabilities come from the squared magnitudes of the components.

Wait, the problem says it's proportional, so I think I need to normalize it first. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should equal 1. Let me calculate that.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. The absolute square of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) because |a + ib|^2 is a^2 + b^2. So that's 1 + 1 = 2. For (2 - i), the absolute square is 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So adding them gives 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7), right? So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. The matrix representation of A is given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because for a two-level system, we have |up> and |down>, so i and j can be 1 and 2.

So the matrix A would look like [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Because for i≠j, elements are ħ/2, and diagonal is zero. Oh wait, wait: no, the diagonal is when i=j, so A_ij is zero for i=j, and ħ/2 otherwise. So the matrix is off-diagonal elements as ħ/2, and diagonal as zero. So A is:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Hmm, what's the operator A? It looks like it's a spin operator in the x or y direction, but maybe not exactly. Because I know that the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Wait, Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because then the elements would be ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 on the diagonal. So yeah, A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A would be ±(ħ/2). So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x.

Wait, how are |+x> and |−x> expressed in terms of |up> and |down>? I remember that |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me check that. Because the σ_x operator swaps the |up> and |down> states. So when σ_x is applied to |+x>, it should return |+x> multiplied by +1. Let me see, σ_x |+x> = σ_x (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) = (σ_x |up> + σ_x |down>)/sqrt(2) = (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) = same as |+x>, so eigenvalue +1. Similarly, for |−x>, it becomes (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), and σ_x acting on that gives (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2) = - |−x>, so eigenvalue -1.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to find the overlap of |alpha> with each of these eigenstates.

But wait, our state |alpha> is already expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, so maybe I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and then find the coefficients. Alternatively, I can compute the inner product between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

Let's compute the expansion
