Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and we're given the rest masses: the pion Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². The options are four possibilities for the kinetic energies of the products.

Hmm, okay. So in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, conservation laws come into play. Specifically, conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the decay products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to maintain zero net momentum. That means the particles will fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

I remember that in such cases, the decay products will share the available energy in a way that their kinetic energies plus their rest masses equal the total energy from the parent particle. Wait, but the pion's rest mass is the total energy available because it's at rest, right? So the total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

Let me break this down. The pion's rest energy is E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest energy is E_mu = m_mu c² = 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, but since it's a neutrino, its energy comes entirely from its kinetic energy because m_nu is approximately zero.

Wait, but neutrinos do have some mass, but in this problem, since it's a pion decay, which usually produces a muon and a neutrino. The neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's, so I think I can treat it as a massless particle. So the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy.

But wait, actually, in pion decay, the pion decays into a muon and a neutrino. The neutrino here is the muon neutrino, which has a very small mass. However, for the sake of this problem, I'm going to proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's mass is
