Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a decay process in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime because of time dilation. The formula for that is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, how does that tie into the resolution needed?

Right, the resolution here probably refers to the minimum distance the chamber can detect between the decay products. Oh wait, no, wait. I think the resolution is about the ability to distinguish the decay point from the original point. So, the particles Y and Z are created at a certain distance from where X⁰ was moving. If the chamber can't resolve that distance (the decay length), we won't see the decay.

So, the decay length L is the distance the X⁰ travels in its own lifetime (τ₀) multiplied by its velocity. Wait, but since we're dealing with relativistic particles, we can't just use v = βc, where β is v/c. So, L = βγ c τ₀.

Wait, yes, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees the lifetime as τ = γ τ₀. So, the particle moves during this longer time, so the distance it travels is L = v * τ = β c γ τ₀.

But wait, another thought: Alternatively, the lifetime observed is τ = γ τ₀, so the distance would be L = β c τ = β γ c τ₀. So that's the same as what I had before.

So the decay length L is β γ c τ₀. But how do we calculate β and γ?

We can get γ from the
