Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. So, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking that down: the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. The substituent is at position 1—so on the same carbon as the aldehyde, there's a cyclohexyl group attached via a methylene group (CH2), which also has a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be something like a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde, and on the same carbon, a CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexyl ring and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So it's a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane ring. That CH2 group has two substituents: a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane with an aldehyde group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl means a triple bond. So it's cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group.

Alright, so how to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's think about the steps.

I remember that when you have an alkyne, you can perform various additions. One common method is hydroboration, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, maybe a Grignard or organometallic reaction could be involved.

Wait, looking at the options, the reagents involved include NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, Li/liq NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH. So these are typical reagents for various reactions: alkali metals for deprotonation, H2 and Pd for hydrogenation, Ba(OH)2 for elimination maybe, H2SO4 with HgSO4 sounds like a oxidation condition, perhaps Jones' oxidation. Ozone is for ozonolysis, and (CH3)2S is a reductive workup in ozonolysis.

Let me think about the transformations. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane. I need to add a hydroxyl group and a methyl group (or something that would become a cyclohexyl after some steps) to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, wait. Wait, the starting molecule is ethynylcyclohexane—so perhaps it's a cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. So perhaps the plan is to add groups to that triple bond.

Optionally, maybe the triple bond can be converted into an aldehyde. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. If I were to hydrogenate that, I could get CH2-CH2-CH2 (but that's just a single bond, not helpful). Alternatively, maybe I can perform a hydration. Oh right, the triple bond can be hydrated to form a ketone, but I'm not sure. Wait, but what conditions would do that?

Wait, another approach. Let's think about adding a methyl group to the triple bond. Maybe using some alkylation. Oh, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps the first step is deprotonating something.

Looking at the options, option A starts with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Oh, so that would be a deprotonation followed by alkylation. So if ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it would deprotonate where? The triple bond is sp-hybridized, so maybe the alpha protons (on the CH2 group adjacent to the triple bond) are acidic. So NaNH2 would deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane to form a lithium or sodium acetylide.

Wait, but NaNH2 is used in deprotonating to form acetylides. So ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 would form the cyclohexane-cyclohexenyl acetylide? Or wait, ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)ethynyl, so the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So deprotonating the terminal alkyne would produce cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate this. So the acetylide would attack methyl chloride, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2-Cl? Wait, no, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So the acetylide would attack, replacing Cl, so the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but that would be (cyclohexyl)propynyl something? Not sure. Wait, the initial structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+.

Adding methyl chloride, the acetylide would attack, adding a methyl group to the sp carbon. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. That's 1-(cyclohexylpropargyl) something? Maybe that's a new structure.

Then, what's the next step. Option A's next step is H2/Pd. So hydrogenation with palladium. That would hydrogenate the triple bond. For a triple bond, H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate it to a single bond. Wait, but do they go all the way, or stop at a double bond?

Wait, typically, hydrogenation of triple bonds with H2 and Pd would go to single bonds. So the product after hydrogenation would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because the triple bond is between two carbons, so hydrogenation would add two H's to each, turning C≡C into CH2-CH2. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Which would be a butyl group attached to the cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem helpful for forming the target molecule.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-ethynyl), after deprotonation and alkylation with methyl chloride, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would saturate the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is between two carbons, so hydrogenation would add two H's to each, making each a CH2 group. So the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that would make the cyclohexane connected to a four-carbon chain. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the second step is different. Let's look at the options again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, O3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if after hydrogenation, maybe I have a double bond somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The target molecule has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the process involves oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Let me think about the possible steps. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

1. Maybe convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group. That could be done via hydration, but with acid? Or maybe via a dihydroxylation followed by oxidation.

Wait, another approach: maybe using a Grignard reagent or similar to add a group.

But looking at the options:

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Hmm, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would introduce an ethyl group. Li and liquid NH3 is a Birch reduction condition, perhaps? Or is it for deprotonation or elimination?

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Wait, methanol as an alkylating agent—maybe forming a ether or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is deprotonating to form an acetylide, then alkylating with something, then hydrogenating, then oxidizing, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde. Because the target has an aldehyde group.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde via some oxidation. But I'm not sure about that.

Let me think about the target molecule. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the aldehyde is at position 1, and the same carbon has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Therefore, perhaps during the synthesis, we need to add an oxime or something that can lead to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of adding a methyl group (which will become CH after some reaction) and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group first. If I can add a hydroxyl group to one end and a methyl group to the other.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is functionalized in a way that forms an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, let's think of the options again. Let's take option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. So form the acetylide and add methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)propargyl methyl ether? Or perhaps adding a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a methyl-substituted acetylide. Then, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, but perhaps in a specific way.

Wait, after adding methyl, the structure is (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would convert the triple bond into a single bond, giving (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's butylcyclohexane—doesn't seem helpful.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Let's think about other options.

Looking at option D: first step is NaNH2 and methanol. So deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then react with methanol. But wait, methanol is a poor alkylating agent. Unless it's used in a different way. Maybe the acetylide would attack a methyl group from somewhere else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's for forming an ether, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. For that, maybe via oxidation. But I don't see an oxidation step in the options as the first step. Wait, option C's third step is O3/(CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis, typically used on alkenes, not alkynes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is first converted into a double bond, then ozonolysis can be used. Let me think.

Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond can give a cis or trans double bond, depending on the catalyst. So, if we hydrogenate the triple bond under certain conditions, perhaps we get a double bond. For example, using H2 and Lindlar catalyst (Pd with quinoline) gives cis, while using Na in NH3 (liquid ammonia) gives trans. But looking at the options, option B has Li and liquid NH3—maybe that's for Birch reduction or deprotonating. Option C has H2/Pd-calcium carbonate—maybe that hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding two substituents to a carbon adjacent to a functional group.

Wait, another strategy: perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. Then, I can perform a substitution to add a hydroxyl group and a methyl group or something that can become a cyclohexyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde. Wait, but how? To get an aldehyde from an alkyne, one approach is to treat the alkyne with a strong oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps via a hydration reaction.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone, then further oxidized or functionalized.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is used in a conjugate addition. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps and see what they would produce.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, MeCl; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4/HgSO4/H2O.

So first, ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. As discussed, this forms a methyl-substituted acetylide, which upon hydrogenation becomes a single bond. Then Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 with HgSO4—this sounds like an oxidation condition, perhaps Jones' oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or further.

Wait, but let me think step by step.

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonated with NaNH2 → acetylide.
2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → adds a methyl group to the acetylide: (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.
3. Hydrogenation (H2/Pd) → converts triple bond to single bond: (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
4. Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination. Or maybe oxidation, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for epoxide opening or elimination.
5. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: Jones' oxidation conditions. Which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but wait, in this case, after step 3, I have a butyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, step 4: maybe Ba(OH)2 is for elimination. But in step 3, after hydrogenation, I have a butyl group. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination, but in which structure? Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in liq NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide.
2. Alkylation with ethyl chloride → (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3? Or is it adding an ethyl group to the acetylide.
Wait, ethyl chloride is CH2CH2Cl. The acetylide would attack, so the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3. But I'm not sure. Then, step 2 is Li in liq NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination. But this might be a Birch reduction condition, which reduces aromatic rings, but maybe here it's used for another purpose. Step 3 is O3, which is ozonolysis—usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. But if the compound after step 2 has a triple bond, ozonolysis would act differently. Or maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond before ozonolysis. Wait, no. So after step 2, the product is (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would give different products. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Then, step 4 is treatment with NH4OH, which could be for workup or hydrolysis.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, MeCl; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Wait, after step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd-calcium carbonate, which probably fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. But wait, ozonolysis of a single bond (like a single bond in a butyl chain) wouldn't do much. Unless the molecule has a double bond, which it doesn't after step 2. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, MeOH; Li/liq NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

So step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and MeOH. NaNH2 is a strong base, so deprotonates the triple bond to form acetylide, which then reacts with MeOH. But MeOH is a poor electrophile for alkylation. Maybe it's for forming an ether, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide could attack methanol to form an OMe group, but that would require a good leaving group, which methanol doesn't have. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a group that can later be oxidized to an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group added.

Wait, another thought: maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone, which is then further functionalized. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is used in a conjugate addition to add a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each option's steps and see which produces the right groups.

Looking for aldehyde formation. Aldehydes are typically formed via oxidation of primary alcohols. So perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Also, the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group which also has a hydroxyl group. So perhaps a CH2 group is attached to both a cyclohexyl ring and a hydroxyl group, all on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, considering that, perhaps the starting ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a cyclohexyl group with a CH2OH group, which is then oxidized to CHO.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2CHO group.

Wait, perhaps the steps would be: add a hydroxyl group to the triple bond, then hydrogenate to form a CH2OH group, then oxidize to aldehyde.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about each option.

Option C: After step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So perhaps prior to that, a double bond is formed.

Wait, so maybe after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated into a double bond. Wait, but hydrogenation of a triple bond usually goes all the way to a single bond. Unless a specific catalyst is used, like Lindlar, which would stop at a cis double bond.

If step 2 uses H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, then the triple bond becomes cis double bond. But looking at option C, the step is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd is usually for full hydrogenation. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone. Wait, but how?

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps one of the steps is adding a cyclohexyl group to a CH2 group, which then gets a hydroxyl group, and then oxidizing.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from the triple bond, then rearranging.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reagents again. Let's look at option D.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, MeOH; Li/liq NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and MeOH.

Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, which then reacts with MeOH. Perhaps the acetylide attacks MeOH, but since MeOH is not a good electrophile, maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide could displace a leaving group in MeOH, but MeOH doesn't have a good leaving group. Hmm, perhaps this is for forming a ketone via some other pathway. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is used to deprotonate the ethynyl group, and MeOH is used as a methylating agent in some way. Like forming an ether, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps MeOH is used in a hydroxide workup after some reaction. Not sure.

Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent, like in Birch reduction. But Birch typically reduces aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's for deprotonating something else.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So perhaps at this point, the molecule has a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But how would the molecule have a double bond after step 2?

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction, forming a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe after step 1, we have a di-substituted alkyne which upon hydrogenation becomes a di-substituted alkene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation of a triple bond to a cis double bond. But that would require a specific catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction to form a trans double bond. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the target molecule and what transformations would lead to it.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, and the same carbon has a CH2 group that's attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Adding a group to the ethynylcyclohexane that will eventually become the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl substituents.

2. Hydrogenating the triple bond in a way that sets up the correct structure.

3. Introducing the aldehyde group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Claisen-Schmidt condensation or similar to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. But I don't remember the exact reagents for that.

Wait, another possibility is that the triple bond is converted into an epoxide, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used in a nucleophilic addition. For example, adding a hydroxyl group to one end and a methyl group to the other, then hydrogenating to form the necessary structure.

Hmm. Let me think of the steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to form acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → adds a methyl group to the acetylide.

3. Hydrogenation of the triple bond → forms a single bond, giving a butyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

4. Oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but the target has an aldehyde. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe oxidation after a different step.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first treated to form a carbonyl group. For example, using O3 would cleave a double bond but not a triple bond. Alternatively, ozonolysis of a triple bond might give different products.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at option C: Steps are NaNH2, MeCl; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So after step 1: (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Then, step 3: O3. But this would require a double bond. Since step 2's product has a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. So that's probably not the right path.

Option B: Steps include O3 after Li in NH3. If Li in NH3 is a reduction, maybe it's a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings to diols. But our starting material isn't aromatic. Alternatively, Li in NH3 could be for deprotonation to form a strong base, which then abstracts a proton and forms a double bond via elimination.

Wait, if Li and NH3 are used, perhaps it's for deprotonation followed by elimination, forming an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of the alkene would break it into two carbonyls.

So, let's think:

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe this deprotonates the compound, leading to an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. So (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a single bond. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a double bond. But without a specific catalyst, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond. If that happens, then ozonolysis could cleave it.

So, after step 2, if the triple bond becomes a double bond, then step 3 (ozonolysis) would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not sure how Li and NH3 would achieve that.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a catalytic hydrogenation that stops at the alkene stage. But without the right catalyst, I don't think so.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about which option leads to the correct functional groups.

The target has an aldehyde group, which suggests an oxidation step. Looking at the options, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O (which is Jones' reagent) is an oxidizing agent that can oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but not aldehydes. Wait, no, Jones' reagent oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones. So, if there's a primary alcohol, it would go all the way to the acid.

But in the target, there's an aldehyde, which is an oxidation of a primary alcohol, but just to the aldehyde stage. So perhaps another oxidizing agent is used, like pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) which oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes. But none of the options mention PCC.

So, maybe I'm missing a step or misinterpreting the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via a different pathway, such as ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. For example, ozonolysis of a double bond followed by (CH3)2S would give aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, if a molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. If the double bond is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes.

Wait, so perhaps the synthesis involves creating a diene, then ozonolysis, then working up to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a diol via hydration, then oxidized.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for the correct answer among the options.

Looking at option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → forms (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → becomes (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → would cleave any double bonds, but this molecule has a single bond. So nothing happens here. Not helpful.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethylCl → (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe deprotonates and eliminates to form a double bond, making (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 into a diene? Not sure.

3. O3 → cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, then oxidizing a hydroxyl group to an aldehyde.

But how would we get the hydroxyl group in the first place?

Wait, perhaps option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, MeOH → perhaps the acetylide reacts with MeOH to form an ether, but that's unclear.

2. Li/NH3 → maybe forms a Grignard-like reagent.

3. O3 → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate with methyl chloride to form (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.

3. Hydrogenate to (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

4. Oxidize to form a ketone or aldehyde.

But the target requires an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each option and see which one leads to the target.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has an aldehyde group and a cyclohexyl group attached. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed by oxidizing a CH2 group. So, perhaps the steps involve introducing a hydroxyl group adjacent to a CH2 group, which then is oxidized to aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, creating a longer chain.

3. Introduce a hydroxyl group via some reaction.

4. Oxidize the hydroxyl group to an aldehyde.

But how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me check.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → forms (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → becomes (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens. So this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 doesn't go all the way but stops at the cis or trans double bond. But I don't think H2/Pd would do that.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, but using a different catalyst. For example, using Lindlar's catalyst would give cis. But option C says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is for full hydrogenation.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the correct steps are to form a cyclohexylmethyl group with an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So, maybe the triple bond is used to add both a methyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but can the triple bond be used to add both groups?

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group, then it is oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is subjected to a hydroboration reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, an alternative approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group with a hydroxyl group via some reaction, then oxidizing to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

Another thought: the target's structure suggests that the starting material's ethynyl group is converted into the aldehyde and the cyclohexyl group. So perhaps adding a methyl group (which becomes a cyclohexyl after some steps) and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is treated to add a hydroxyl group and a methyl group across the triple bond, then maybe hydrogenated and oxidized.

But I'm not recalling the exact reactions.

Wait, perhaps option D is more promising. Let me think.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, MeOH; Li/liq NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and MeOH. Maybe the acetylide reacts with MeOH, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps it's for forming an OMe group, but I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. Could this be for a Birch reduction, but the starting material isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it could be for deprotonation to form a strong base, which then abstracts a proton, leading to elimination and forming a double bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into two carbonyl groups. So if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde or ketone groups.

Step 4: NH4OH, which could be a workup (acidic or basic conditions).

So, putting it together:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide with NaNH2.

2. Alkylation with MeOH, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is forming a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group, then step 2 is elimination to form a double bond, then step 3 is ozonolysis.

Let me try this:

After step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 could deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond, leading to elimination and forming a double bond. So, (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2 → but that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenolysis, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to think of the target and see what reagents would form it.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps the steps are:

- Add a methyl group to the triple bond.

- Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

- Introduce a hydroxyl group via oxidation.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a butyl group.

3. Oxidize the end of the butyl group to an aldehyde.

But that would give a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a butyl group, which isn't the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon. So, the same carbon has the aldehyde and the CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

- Convert the ethynyl group into a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and an aldehyde.

But I don't know how.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and a cyclohexyl group via some addition.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is subjected to a hydroxylation reaction, adding an OH group and another substituent.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the correct answer is option C. Here's why:

After step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenation gives (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that's a butyl group, which doesn't help. So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, another possibility: The target molecule has both a cyclohexane ring and a cyclohexyl group attached. So perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is used to form a ring expansion or some cycloaddition, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond (using specific catalysts, though the options may not specify that).

3. Ozonolyse the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work up the ozonolysis to form aldehydes.

So, looking for an option that includes adding a methyl group, then forming a double bond, then ozonolysis.

Looking at option C, step 3 is ozonolysis. So perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond.

But in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd, which I think would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, not a double bond. So that's not helpful.

Looking at option B: step 2 is Li in NH3, which might be for forming a double bond via elimination.

So step 1: (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → maybe deprotonates and eliminates a proton, forming a double bond.

So (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH2Li? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is transformed into a double bond. If so, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not certain about the reagents involved.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond, ozonolysis to form aldehydes, and then some workup.

But I'm not seeing the exact option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 to a hydroxyl and the aldehyde. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group (which becomes cyclohexyl after some steps) and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing a clear path.

Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, I'll make an educated guess. I think option C is the correct one. Here's why:

After step 1, we have a methyl-substituted alkyne.

Step 2: Hydrogenated to a single bond, giving a longer chain.

Step 3: Ozonolysis, but I'm not sure how that fits. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation stops at a double bond, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are in option C:

1. Add methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenate to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis is not applicable, so perhaps the correct steps are elsewhere.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for the presence of a cyclohexyl group in the target, which comes from the starting material. So perhaps one of the steps is adding a cyclohexyl group via some coupling.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane; maybe the cyclohexyl group is already present.

Ah! Wait a minute. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2-C≡CH group.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon. So the CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

So, the ethynyl group (CH2-C≡CH) is attached to the cyclohexane. We need to modify this group to become a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and form the aldehyde.

So, perhaps the way to do this is:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a ketone or aldehyde.

2. Add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into an aldehyde. Then, the adjacent CH2 group can be functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a secondary alcohol, which can then be oxidized to a ketone, but that's not helpful for forming an aldehyde.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I'll have to make a guess based on the options.

After considering all the options and steps, I think the correct answer is option C. But I'm not entirely sure.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon. The starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, is a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2-C≡CH group. The synthesis involves functionalizing the triple bond to introduce the necessary substituents and transformations.

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, resulting in (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: Likely causes elimination or oxidation, but it is unclear how this step contributes to forming the target molecule.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Jones' oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but the intermediate does not contain a primary alcohol. This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne and alkylates it with ethyl chloride, resulting in (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely deprotonates and eliminates to form a double bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.
3. **O3/ H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Workup to stabilize the carbonyl groups. However, this sequence does not produce the required aldehyde and hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne and alkylates it with methyl chloride, resulting in (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **O3/ (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but the intermediate does not contain a double bond after step 2. This sequence does not align with the target molecule.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: Likely causes elimination or oxidation, but its role is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne, but methanol is not a strong electrophile for alkylation, making this step ambiguous.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely deprotonates and eliminates to form a double bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH=CH-CH3.
3. **O3/ (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Workup to stabilize the carbonyl groups. However, this sequence does not produce the required aldehyde and hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly produce the target molecule. However, based on the steps and reagents provided, **Option C** is the most plausible, as it involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the triple bond, and potentially introducing functional groups that could lead to the target molecule.

**Answer: C**
