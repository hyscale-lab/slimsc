Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's an interesting premise. I remember that in our real world, magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't isolate them. But if that's not the case here, Maxwell's equations would change, right?

Wait, Maxwell's equations. Let me think. There are four of them. Each one describes a different aspect of electromagnetic fields. 

The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field and relates to charge density. Gauss's law for electricity. So if we're only changing magnetic properties, maybe this one stays the same? Unless... unless magnetic monopoles affect something else. But Gauss's law for E fields is about electric charges, so maybe it's unaffected.

The second equation is Faraday's law of induction, which deals with the curl of the electric field and changing magnetic flux. Oh wait, Faraday's law says that the curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. But if there are magnetic monopoles, does that change anything here? I'm not sure. Maybe not directly, unless the flux has a different behavior.

The third equation is Gauss's law for magnetism, which says the divergence of B is zero. Oh right! Because in our world, there are no isolated magnetic monopoles, so the divergence of B is zero. But if there are, then this equation would change. So Gauss's law for magnetism would have a term related to the magnetic charge density. So that equation would definitely be altered.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which involves the curl of the magnetic field and the current plus the displacement current. So Ampère's law is about the curl of B being equal to mu_0 times (J + epsilon_0 dE/dt). If we have magnetic monopoles, does that affect Ampère's law? Well, Ampère's law relates to how B is generated by currents and changing E fields. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps a new term would appear in Ampère's law or in Faraday's law.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. Maxwell's equations in the real world are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
3. ∇·B = 0
4. ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

In a world with magnetic monopoles, equation 3 would change. Because ∇·B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, say rho_m. So equation 3 would become ∇·B = μ₀ rho_m or something like that. So that equation changes.

But what about Ampère's law? In the real world, it's equation 4 that deals with the curl of B. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps there would be an additional term in equation 4. Or maybe a new equation for the divergence of E? No, because equation 1 is about electric charge.

Wait, but in standard theory, when people talk about magnetic monopoles, they often propose modifying Maxwell's equations by adding terms. For example, the modified Ampère's law would include a term for the magnetic current
