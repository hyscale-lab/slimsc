Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It asks two parts: A and B. 

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which will show optical isomerism.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible answers for A and B.

First, let me tackle part A. I need to determine which of the two compounds doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

I remember that tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between adjacent atoms, leading to different structures. This usually involves the movement of a hydrogen from an oxygen to another atom, like moving between a carbonyl group and an alcohol group.

Looking at benzoquinone: benzoquinone is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. I think it's similar to 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Does it have any hydrogens that can shift? Well, quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism if there's an adjacent hydrogen. Wait, maybe benzoquinone has two keto groups on the benzene ring. If it's 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. So each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring. Do these have any alpha hydrogens? Wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is part of the aromatic system. The quinone structure has each O attached to a carbon which is double-bonded. So each O is at a position where they are part of the aromatic ring and can't have alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. Wait, but wait, in benzene rings, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one double bond. So, maybe the adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens available for tautomerism. Hmm, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens because the ring is fully conjugated. So, no tautomerism possible.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively
