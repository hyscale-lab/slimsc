Okay, so I have this physics problem about a meson resonance and I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the question gives me some values: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to calculate the mean decay distance, and the options are all in meters, varying by powers of ten.

Wait, I remember that decay properties are related to the lifetime of the particle. The mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by its lifetime, right? So lifetime is the mean lifetime, which is related to the width Γ. Oh right, the width Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime τ is hbar divided by Γ. 

But wait, I'm given Γ in MeV. I should probably convert that to energy in the same units as the mass and production energy. Or perhaps I can work with units consistently. Let me think about the formula.

The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. And then the decay length L is τ multiplied by the velocity v times the energy E (since velocity is E divided by (m c^2), but wait, units might get tricky here. Maybe I should use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1 for easier calculations. 

Wait, in natural units, c=1 and ħ=1 (about 197 MeV·fm). So, if I'm working in GeV and inverse GeV, maybe I can proceed.

So let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to find the lifetime τ. Since Γ is given as 320 MeV, and τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ in GeV·s is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (320 MeV). Wait, need to make sure the units are compatible. 320 MeV is 0.320 GeV. So τ = (6.582e
