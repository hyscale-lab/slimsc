Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about nucleophilicity. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent and the basicity of the nucleophile. Wait, the question is about arranging the nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution. 

The options given are five different nucleophiles: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate. I need to rank them.

First, I should recall the factors affecting nucleophilicity. In polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity follows basicity because the solvent doesn't stabilize the nucleophile much. But in polar protic solvents like water, it's a bit different because the solvent can stabilize the nucleophile through solvation. Stronger bases are actually less nucleophilic in such solvents because they're more stabilized and less reactive.

So, the solvent here is aqueous, which is a polar protic solvent. So nucleophilicity is inversely related to the nucleophile's basicity in such cases because the stronger base is more solvated and hence less reactive.

Wait, but wait, I also remember that in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is opposite to their basicity. So weaker bases are better nucleophiles here. Or is it the other way around? No, I think it's that the more basic a nucleophile, the less nucleophilic it is in a polar protic solvent because they get more solvated. So more basic ones are more stabilized and thus less reactive.

So I need to list each nucleophile's strength as a base. The stronger the base, the less nucleophilic it is in aqueous solution.

Let me list the nucleophiles and their approximate basicity:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's a conjugate base of a tertiary alcohol. Alkoxide ions are strong bases. Tertiary alkoxides are less basic than primary because they're more stabilized (since tertiary carbons are more substituted and the negative charge is delocalized better). Wait, no, waitâ€”tertiary alcohols have conjugate bases (alkoxides) that are less basic than
