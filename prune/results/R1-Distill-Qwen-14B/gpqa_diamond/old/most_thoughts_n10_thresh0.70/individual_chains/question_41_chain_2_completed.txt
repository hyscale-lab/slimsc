Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is 1.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, right? And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is inside the glass, which itself is moving.

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light within that medium as observed in the lab frame might not just be c/n, because the medium is moving. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.

I think this is a problem involving special relativity. Because the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, but here the medium is moving, and it's glass, which has a refractive index. So how does that affect things?

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v. So from the lab frame, which is the observer's frame, the glass is moving at v. The light is inside the glass, so we need to relate the speed of light in the glass in the lab frame.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But when the glass is moving, we have to apply a Lorentz transformation to find the speed in the lab frame.

Right, so let's think about it. The speed of light in the glass's rest frame (S') is u' = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame (S). So we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity to find the speed u in the lab frame.

The velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²). But wait, in this case, u' is the speed in the glass frame. So substituting u' = c/n.

So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So putting it all together: u = (c/(n) + v) / (1 + (v)/(n c) )

Hmm, let's factor out c from the numerator and denominator. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out something else. Let's see:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to make it easier. Let's see:

Numerator: (c + n v) 

Denominator: (n + v) because (n * denominator) = n * (1 + v/(n c)) ) = n + v/c * n /n? Wait, wait. Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)) = (n c + v)/(n c) )

So when I substitute back, u becomes:

(c/n + v) divided by ( (n c + v) )/(n c) )

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n cancels out, so:

u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but wait, let me do this step by step.

The numerator after substitution is:

(c/n + v) = (c + n v)/n.

The denominator is [1 + (v/(n c))] = [n c + v]/(n c).

So the entire expression is:

[(c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] = [(c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c)/(n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator of the first fraction cancels with the n in the numerator of the second fraction.

So we have:

(c + n v) * (c) / (n c + v )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Wait, (n c + v) is the denominator, and the numerator is c (c + n v). Let me write it out:

u = c(c + n v) / (n c + v )

Hmm, can this be simplified further?

Wait, let's factor out c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, n c + v = v + n c.

But in the numerator, c(c + n v )= c^2 + c n v.

So u = (c^2 + c n v) / (n c + v )

But wait, the options don't have any c^2 terms because c=1. So let's substitute c=1.

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)
Option B: 1
Option C: (1 + n v)/(n - v)
Option D: (1 -n v)/(n + v)

So according to my calculation, the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which is option A. But wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity.

Wait, in the velocity addition formula, if the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then u' is the velocity in S', and u is the velocity in S.

Wait, no, the formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v / c² )

But in this case, the frame S' is the glass frame, moving at velocity v relative to S (the lab frame). So the light's velocity in S' is u' = c/n (since in the glass's frame, the speed is c/n). So applying the formula:

u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' v)/(c²) ]

But wait, the direction matters. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So if the lab frame sees the glass moving at velocity v towards them, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, that is, from the glass's frame, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the sign convention. Let's assume that the direction from the lab is such that the glass is moving at velocity v in the positive x-direction. So in S, the glass is moving at +v.

In the glass's frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n. So in S', the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is the same as the lab's positive x-direction.

So in S, using the velocity addition formula, u (the speed of light in lab) is:

u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' v)/(c²) ]

Substituting u' = c/n, and c=1:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) )

Which is [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + v/(n) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

[1 + n v ] / [n + v ]

So yes, that gives u = (1 + n v) / (n + v ), which is option A.

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Because if the medium is moving toward the observer, would that affect the speed? But according to the calculation, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is less than 1 if v is positive and small.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass, which is moving. So the speed in the glass is c/n in its rest frame, but when it's moving, the lab frame measures a different speed.

So the calculation comes to (1 + n v)/(n + v). So the correct answer is A.

Looking at the options, that's option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the lab frame, and in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. Substituting \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) into the velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:

\[
u = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) in the problem, this reduces to:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option B (\( 1 \)) does not account for the refractive index or the motion of the glass.
- Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) incorrectly uses \( n - v \) in the denominator, which is not consistent with the velocity addition formula.
- Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) incorrectly introduces a negative sign in the numerator, which is not supported by the derivation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
