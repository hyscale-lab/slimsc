Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, but wait, the energy expression is a bit tricky. Let me think. Each spin is either +1 or -1, so each has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible configurations is 2^3 = 8. I'll need to list all possible states and calculate their energies, then sum the exponentials.

But maybe there's a smarter way than brute-forcing through all 8 states. Let me think about the symmetry here. The energy depends on the products of pairs of spins. So perhaps the energy is the same for states with the same number of aligned pairs.

Wait, let's calculate H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So each term is either +1 or -1. Because S_i and S_j are either +1 or -1, their product is +1 if they're the same, -1 otherwise.

So H is the sum of three such terms. Let me think about possible values of H.

Each term can be +1 or -1, so the sum H can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Because adding three terms each ±1.

Wait, no, wait. Let's see: the maximum sum would be 3 (all three terms +1), the minimum would be -3 (all three -1). But what about other possibilities?

Wait, no, because each term is S_i S_j. Let's think about for each state, what is H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of pairs that are aligned. Because each S_i S_j = 1 if they're aligned, -1 otherwise. So H = (number of aligned pairs) * 1 + (number of misaligned pairs) * (-1). Since there are three pairs, the number of aligned pairs can be 0, 1, 2, 3.

Wait, but if all spins are aligned, all three pairs are aligned. If two spins are aligned
