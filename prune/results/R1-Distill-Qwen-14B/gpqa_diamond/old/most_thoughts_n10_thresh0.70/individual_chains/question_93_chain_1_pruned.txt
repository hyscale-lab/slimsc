Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about qPCR and calibration curves.

The question says a scientist is setting up a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The qPCR efficiency is 100%, which I think means it's perfectly efficient—so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means the data fits perfectly, right? And the slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula I think is something like slope = log(e) / ln(e) * log(10), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the efficiency formula.

Wait, the standard way to calculate the slope in a qPCR curve is using the formula:

slope = (log E) / (ln E) * log(10) * (1 / efficiency)

Or wait, maybe it's better to think of the relationship between Ct and the log of the starting quantity. The calibration curve usually is a linear regression of Ct vs log (starting quantity). The ideal slope is -3.3219 if the efficiency is 100% (since log(2) is about 0.3010, so ln(2) is 0.693, so (ln(2)/log(2)) is about 2.3026, but wait I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula I think is that the slope is calculated as (ln E) / (log E) * something. Alternatively, the expected slope when the efficiency is 100% (E=1) would be -3.3219. Because when E=100%, the equation for the calibration curve is Ct = (log10(N0)) * slope + intercept. The slope is calculated as (ln E)/ (log E) * log10(e) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should just calculate it.

If efficiency E=100% = 1, then the efficiency in decimal is 0.001? No, wait, the efficiency is typically expressed as a fraction. So
