Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and Lyman alpha absorption. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for hydrogen. But ground-based telescopes can't observe UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the absorbed light is shifted into the optical range, that would mean the object is at a high redshift, right?

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. That's in the far UV. If the cloud has a redshift z, then the observed wavelength lambda_obs would be lambda_emit * (1 + z). The emitted wavelength here is 1216 Angstroms.

Ground-based telescopes can't see UV, so the observed wavelength has to be in the optical range. The optical range is roughly 400 nm to about 700 nm, I think. So lambda_obs has to be less than, say, 700 nm but more than about 400 nm?

Wait, actually, wait. No, because if the quasar's light is absorbed at Lyman alpha, which is 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), and if the cloud is at redshift z, then the absorption line would be observed at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. But ground-based telescopes can't detect wavelengths shorter than about 300 nm because of atmospheric absorption (like the ozone layer). So the observed wavelength after redshift must be longer than 300 nm for ground-based telescopes to see it. Otherwise, that wavelength would be in UV and not observable.

So the condition is 1216*(1 + z) >= 300 nm. Wait, but wait, 300 nm is 30 Angstroms, right? Because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms? Wait, no. Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms. That's a lot. Hmm that doesn't make sense because 1216 Angstroms is about 121 nm. So if z is 1, the observed wavelength would be 2432 Angstroms, which is 243 nm. And 243 nm is still in UV, I think. But wait, what's the cutoff for ground-based telescopes?

Oh, right, Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 310 nm (which is 3100 Angstroms). Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer,
