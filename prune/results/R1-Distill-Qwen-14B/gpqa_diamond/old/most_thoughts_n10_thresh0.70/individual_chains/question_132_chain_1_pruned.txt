Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let's take it step by step.

The molecular formula given is C10H14 for each compound. Hmm, wait, but wait, the mixture is 1:1, so each component must have the same molecular formula. Let me think: each aromatic compound is a tetramethylbenzene because the options are all that. So, each has four methyl groups attached to benzene rings.

Looking at the NMR data, there are two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Oh wait, but the question says it's a 1:1 mixture. So, each compound contributes a signal, but each has only one set of aromatic protons? Or maybe each compound has a singlet, and they each contribute equally, so two singlets in the 1H NMR.

Wait, the aromatic region is about 6.7 ppm, which is a bit downfield. Maybe the aromatic protons are deshielded because of substituents. But wait, if the substituents are electron-donating like methyl groups, the ring is activated, so the protons might be more shielded, but I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the ring isn't para-substituted in such a way that all the aromatic protons are equivalent, so each would give a singlet.

Wait, the problem says two singlets in the aromatic region, each a singlet. So each aromatic compound must have equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a singlet. Let me think about the options.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's draw these structures.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So the positions are adjacent around the ring. What's the structure like? The benzene ring has four methyl groups in a row. Wait, that's a bit crowded. Hmm, but in such a scenario, the remaining two positions (5 and 6) have no substituents. Wait, but the molecule would have a certain symmetry. Let me think about the aromatic protons.

Wait, but in 1,2,3
