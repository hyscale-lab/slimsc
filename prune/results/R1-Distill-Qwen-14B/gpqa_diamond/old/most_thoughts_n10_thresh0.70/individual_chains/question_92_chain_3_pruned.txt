Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Right, I remember that.

The compound in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. It looks like it's a conjugated diene or something with multiple double bonds and branching. Maybe it's a molecule with two double bonds connected by single bonds, each with substituents.

The data given includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, atomization is the process of breaking all bonds in a molecule to produce isolated atoms. So that's the energy required to turn graphite (the standard state) into gaseous atoms, I think. 

The bond energies provided are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, wait. I remember that bond energies are usually given per mole, so all the given values are per mole. But the options have some in kJ/mol and others in kJ/g, so I need to be careful with units.

The problem is to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound. The formula for calculating this using bond energies is: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds)

Wait, actually, no. The formation is from elements, so I think the approach is to consider the energy released when the molecule is formed from its constituent atoms. Alternatively, using bond energies, we can calculate the enthalpy change as the sum of the energies of the bonds broken minus the sum of the energies of the bonds formed.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon like this, it's formed from carbon and hydrogen.

The process would be: C(graphite) + H2(g) â†’ (CH3)2C
