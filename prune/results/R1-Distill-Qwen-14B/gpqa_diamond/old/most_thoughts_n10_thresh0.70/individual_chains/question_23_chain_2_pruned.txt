Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's take it step by step. The question is about the reaction of a specific compound with hydrogen bromide. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen bromide is a common reagent for certain types of reactions, like additions or substitutions.

The compound in question is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that out. So the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group. Wait, but that's substituted with two methyl groups on carbon 2. So the structure is: the benzene has an O- group, and the O is attached to a CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, maybe I should think about the but-3-en-1-yl group.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait: but-3-en-1-yl is actually CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but butenyl only has four carbons. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C
