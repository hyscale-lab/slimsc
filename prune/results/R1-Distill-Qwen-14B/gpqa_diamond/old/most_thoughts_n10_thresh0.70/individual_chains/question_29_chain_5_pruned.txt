Okay, I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to break it down. So, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that's not good for food because of an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they're looking for a mutation that would eliminate the compound. The task is to figure out which mutant would likely achieve that.

The intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences. I think I need to look at the mutations in these sequences to see which one would most probably disrupt the gene's function, specifically the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

Let me list out the mutants and compare their sequences to the intact gene.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing to the intact gene, let me see the differences. The first part is a bit tricky because I have to find where the change occurs.

Looking at the beginning, the first part is ATGTTTCTC... in the intact. In Mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACG... Hmm, so maybe the first few codons change. Let me break it down:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ... etc.
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG ... Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Wait, the first part of the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGT... So, where's the change?

Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Intact: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, maybe the fourth codon is different. Let me number them.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, in the fourth codon, intact is CTC (Leucine), mutant1 is CTA (Leucine) and then ACG (which is Thr). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look for where the change occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the first part is the same up to a point. Let me see: The first 5 nucleotides in the intact are ATGTT, and in mutant1, it's ATGTT as well. So the first codon is the same (methionine). Next in intact, it's TCT CGC TGG TAC T... Wait, perhaps I should look for the first differing base. Let me write out the sequences.

Intact:
Position 1-60: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TTA TTA TGC TGT C

Mutant1:
ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TTA TGC TGT C

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me compare each position one by one.

Intact and Mutant1:

Intact:
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TTA TTA TGC TGT C…TGA-3’

Mutant1:
5’-ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TTA TGC TGT C…TGA-3’

Wait, that doesn't look right. Oh, perhaps the sequences are:

Wait, perhaps I should realign the sequences.

The intact sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So comparing:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, maybe I'm not seeing it right. Let me try a different approach. Let's look for the exact point where the sequences differ.

Looking at the first part, the intact has 'TTTCTCGC', and Mutant1 has 'TTCTACGC'. Hmm, so let me see:

Intact: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ...TTT CT ACG C...

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon in the intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant1, it's CTA (Leu), but then followed by ACG (Thr). Or maybe there's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's look for changes in the amino acid sequence. The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests the mutation disrupts the gene's function, so likely a premature stop codon, or a frameshift leading to a nonfunctional protein, or a missense mutation in a critical region.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: The change is at position where the sequence shifts. Let me see the first differing nucleotides
