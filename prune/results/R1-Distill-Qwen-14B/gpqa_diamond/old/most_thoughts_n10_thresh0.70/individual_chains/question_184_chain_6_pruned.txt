Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw its structure to visualize it better. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Wait, wait, positions are numbered such that the substituents are in the correct order. So, if position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro, that would make them in a meta arrangement relative to each other. Wait, no, because 1,2,3 are adjacent; actually, in benzene, 1,2,3 are all adjacent in a row, so the substituents are at meta positions but adjacent.

Wait, no, benzene is a ring. Let me think of numbering. Let's say position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at adjacent positions. So the ethoxy is at position 1, then moving clockwise, position 2 is the tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3 in a row. So that's adjacent positions.

But wait, benzene is a ring, so the actual positions are 1,2,3 in a row. So the substituents are ortho to each other. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at 1,2,3. So substituents would be on every other carbon. Hmm, no, 1,2,3 are consecutive. So substituents are ortho and meta. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of directing effects.

So the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. Now, I need to figure out the order of reactions to get these substituents on the benzene ring in the correct positions.
