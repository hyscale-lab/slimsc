Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a given matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I remember that matrices like S often relate to Pauli matrices, which are used in spin-1/2 systems.

So, first, let's write down the matrix A_y. Since c is h/(4π), and S is the given matrix, A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, I think the Pauli matrices are usually defined as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The given S looks like the Pauli Y matrix, but I should check. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly S. So S = σ_y.

So, then, A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Let's recall that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, let's write A_y - a I:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a       (h/(4π)) * (-i)          ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i          (h/(4π)) * 0 - a          ]

Which simplifies to:

[ -a       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a      ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h)/(4π) * (i h)/(4π) ) ].

Calculating the determinant:

= a² - [ (-i)(i) (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So:

= a² - [ (1) (h^2) / (16 π²) ) ]

So determinant is a² - [ (h²) / (16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So, a² = (h²)/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4 π) and a = -h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are real? Or wait, am I making a mistake here?

Wait, no, wait. The matrix S is Hermitian? Because Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So S is Hermitian, which makes A_y also Hermitian because c is real.
