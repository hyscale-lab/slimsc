Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's read it carefully. So, four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi squared times hbar squared over twice m L squared. 

Hmm, wait. The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are known. The formula is E_n = (n²) * (pi² ħ²) / (2mL²), which is exactly E. So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n, which is a positive integer. So E_n = n² E, right?

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n, but since they're spin-1/2 particles, their spin can be either up or down. So each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins.

So the strategy is to assign each particle the lowest possible n values, making sure that no more than two particles are in the same n level. Let's think about how their quantum numbers would be filled.

The ground state is the lowest energy, so we need the first four particles to be arranged in the lowest possible n's. Since each n can hold two particles, let's distribute them.

For four particles, let's see:

First, fill n=1: holds 2 particles (spin up and down)
Then n=2: another 2 particles. So, all four are in n=1 and n=2 levels. So the ground state configuration is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ground state would have the lowest energy possible. So each particle must have the lowest possible n, subject to Pauli's exclusion.

So for four particles, the filling would be:

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spin up and down)
That's four particles.

So the total energy in the ground state would be the sum of each particle's energy. Each particle in n=1 contributes E, each in n=2 contributes 4E (since E_n =n² E). Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, individual energies:

Each particle in n=1: E =1² E = E.

Each in n=2: 2² E=4E.

So two particles in n=1 contribute 2 * E = 2E.

Two in n=2 contribute 2 * 4E =8E.

Total ground state energy is 2E +8E=10E? Wait, wait no. Wait, wait, each of the four particles is either in state 1 or 2.

Wait, no. Each of the four particles is either in n=1 or n=2. So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Two particles in n=1: each has E, so 2E.

Two particles in n=2: each has 4E, so 8E.

So total energy for ground state is 2E +8E =10E.

Wait, but that's the sum. So the ground state energy is 10E? But wait, let me think again. Because particles are fermions, the ground state is when all are filled as much as possible in the lowest states with their spins considered.

But wait, in the ground state, the four particles would be in the lowest possible n's possible, considering spin. So four particles, each with unique quantum states. Let's see: each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So four particles would occupy n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the sum of individual energies is 2E + 8E =10E. But the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 30E, 39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E, 10E, 15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the ground state is 10E. But looking at the options, both B and D have 10E as an option. B has 4E as the first, which would be the ground state? No, I thought 10E is the ground state.

Wait, maybe I have the configuration wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, wait a second. For four spin-1/2 particles, each with n=1 and n=2. So that's 2 particles in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and 2 in n=2. So the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E.

So that's the ground state. So the ground state energy is 10E. So the options that have 10E as the first value would be B and D. Let's see.

Option B: 4E,10E,50E.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So ground state is 10E, so options B and D have 10E as the first or second value. Wait, the first value for option D is 10E, which would be the ground state. But according to my previous calculation, the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the possible states.

Wait, no, I think my initial calculation is right. The ground state is when the particles are as
