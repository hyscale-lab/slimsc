Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slowly because I'm still pretty new to this.

The question starts with Compound A. The proton NMR data for A is given: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that NMR signals can tell us about the structure of the molecule. Let's think about what these signals could represent.

A triplet at 0.9 ppm, 6H. That's a lot of protons. The triplet usually arises from coupling with two neighboring protons. 0.9 ppm is usually for methyl groups attached to something, maybe a CH2. So, maybe it's a CH2CH2CH3 situation or something similar. Wait, 6H being a triplet. Oh, wait! Maybe it's two sets of CH3 groups. Let's see, if it's a -CH2CH3 group, each CH3 would have 3 H. So two of them would give 6 H. And the triplet suggests that each CH3 is next to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. Wait, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. Like, two ethyl groups connected to the same carbon. Each ethyl group has two CH2 groups and a CH3. Wait, but ethyl groups have one CH2 adjacent to another, so the splitting would be different. Let me think: an ethyl group's NMR. The CH3 at the end is a triplet because it's next to a CH2 which has two protons. Oh wait, no, the CH3 in ethyl is a triplet because it's next to a CH2 with two protons that are split into a triplet. And the CH2 next to it would be a quartet because it's next to the CH3 (which has 3 H, so quartet).

Wait, let's see: So in an ethyl group, like CH2CH3, the CH3 is a triplet (
