Okay, so I'm trying to solve this black hole entropy problem. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, and it's related to the area of their event horizon. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. But wait, I might be mixing up some constants here. Let me think.

The problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I guess I can use this to find the size of the event horizon, and from there the area.

So angular size θ in radians is approximately equal to the ratio of the size of the object (like the diameter of the event horizon) to the distance. I should convert θ from degrees to radians first. Since 1 degree is π/180 radians, θ in radians is 10^-17 * π/180. Let me calculate that:

θ ≈ (10^-17) * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, no, wait: 1 degree is about 0.01745 radians, so 1e-17 degrees is approx 1.745e-19 radians. Yeah.

Assuming that the event horizon is roughly a circle, its diameter would be approximately θ * d. So the diameter D = θ * d. But wait, the event horizon radius is R = (2 G M)/(c^2), right? Oh, but maybe I don't need the mass. Let's see.

Wait, since I'm only looking for the order of magnitude, perhaps I can proceed with just the given data. So the diameter is about θ * d. But wait, is that correct? Because for small angles, θ ≈ (size)/(distance). So yes, size is θ * distance. So size ≈ θ d.

Wait, but θ is in radians. So size L = θ * d. So the diameter of the event horizon is θ * d.

Wait, but the event horizon is a sphere, so the radius would be (θ * d) / 2. So R ≈ θ d / 2.

But perhaps I got that wrong. Because θ is the angular size
