Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. So the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. I'm told that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass-energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, but protons and antiprotons annihilate... right, in annihilation, they convert into other particles. But wait, this process might not be typical annihilation since it's producing these A particles. I think I should consider conservation laws here—like conservation of energy and momentum.

The antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, that's important. So maybe I can approximate its kinetic energy as small compared to its rest mass energy. Wait, no, because if it's moving slowly, its kinetic energy is low, so perhaps the total energy is mostly the rest energy. But protons have the same mass as antiprotons, right? So the proton is at rest, or is it?

Wait, the setup says the antiproton is slowly moving. So the proton is probably at rest, because the problem doesn't say it's moving. Or wait, the problem says "the antiproton is slowly moving"—so perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. So their initial momenta are the antiproton's momentum and the proton's zero. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its momentum is small compared to its rest mass times c.

So the initial system has the proton (mass m_p) at rest and the antiproton (same mass) moving with some velocity, let's say v_p. The total energy is the rest energy of the proton plus the energy of the moving antiproton.

Wait, but wait, protons are baryons, and annihilating with antiprotons typically produce mesons. But here, the products are these A+ and A- particles, which I assume are bosons or something else. But perhaps the specifics don't matter; it's about energy and momentum conservation.

In the annihilation, the initial energy comes from the proton and antiproton. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton has energy gamma * m_p c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since it's moving slowly, v is small, so gamma is close to 1. So maybe I can approximate gamma as 1 plus (v²)/(2c²), but perhaps that's getting too detailed.

The total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c². Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c². But wait, for a proton, m_p c² is about 938 MeV. But the problem states m_A c² is 300 MeV. So maybe m_p is 938 MeV/c², but m_A is 300 MeV/c².

Wait, so the initial energy is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. But the products are four particles—2 A+ and 2 A−. Each A has mass 300 MeV/c². So their rest energy is 300 * 2 * 2 = 1200 MeV? Wait, no, 2 A+ and 2 A−, each has mass 300 MeV, so total rest energy is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. But wait, the initial energy is around 1876 MeV, so the products have some kinetic energy as well.

But wait, the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. Because the proton is at rest, initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v. Since v is small, p_initial ≈ m_p v. Hmm, but I'm not sure how to relate this.

So, using conservation of momentum, the total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum. The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, and the proton is at rest, the initial momentum is just the antiproton's momentum.

In the final state, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to p_initial. But wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the velocities of the A particles, only that we need to find the velocity of each A. Hmm, perhaps the A particles are all moving in the same direction, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe they move symmetrically, but perhaps for simplicity, let's assume that all four A particles move in the same direction, each with velocity v_A. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the final particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. But without knowing their directions, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all four A particles have the same speed, and that their momenta add up in a particular way—like two in one direction and two in the opposite, but that might cancel some momentum. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is small. So the final particles must have a small total momentum. Since each A has a certain momentum, perhaps each is moving with a velocity that makes their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the conservation of energy and momentum in the center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, think in the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

Wait, another thought: if the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v, and v is small, then perhaps the final particles have a total momentum that's approximately the same. Since the initial momentum is small, the final momentum is approximately p_initial.

But the problem is to find the velocity of each A. Hmm, perhaps each A has the same speed, so each contributes momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A. Since there are four A's, the total momentum would be 4 * p_A. So, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = p_initial = gamma m_p v.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so gamma is approximately 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v.

So 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v.

But what about the energy? The total energy is initial energy E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

The final energy is E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Hmm, setting E_initial = E_final:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = 2 m_p.

So gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A).

Wait, m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So m_p/(2 m_A) = 938/(2*300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

So gamma_A is approximately 1.5633.

So gamma = 1.5633 → 1/sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) = 1.5633.

Solving for v_A:

sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) = 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.6408.

So 1 - v_A²/c² = (0.6408)^2 ≈ 0.4106.

So v_A²/c² = 1 - 0.4106 = 0.5894 → v_A = sqrt(0.5894) c ≈ 0.7676 c, which is approximately 0.77c. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any incorrect assumptions here?

I assumed that all four A particles have the same speed and move in the same direction, so that their momenta add up. But in reality, they might be moving in different directions, so their momenta could cancel each other out or add in a different way. However, if the initial momentum is along a certain direction, the final momenta might sum to that.

But in this case, the initial momentum is p_initial, so the total final momentum must be p_initial. If all four A's are moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 p_A. But if they move in different directions, the momentum could be less. However, if the initial momentum is small (since the antiproton is moving slowly), perhaps the A's must collectively have a small momentum, so each would have a high velocity but in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial p. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is symmetric, so the four A particles are arranged symmetrically. For example, two pairs moving in opposite directions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the four A particles are all moving in the same direction, each with velocity v_A. Then their momenta would add up to 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Wait, but in reality, the A particles might be moving in such a way that their momenta sum to the initial momentum. But perhaps the problem expects us to use the assumption that velocity is same for all A particles, so that the momentum adds up.

But let's think again. I used energy conservation and momentum conservation. Wait, I might have forgotten to account for the fact that the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c^2 (proton at rest) + gamma m_p c^2 (antiproton). Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c^2.

The final energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c², because each A has energy gamma_A m_A c^2.

Setting them equal: 4 gamma_A m_A = 2 m_p → gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A) = (938)/(600) ≈ 1.563.

Thus, beta = v_A / c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A)^2) → sqrt(1 - (1/(1.563)^2)).

Compute 1.563^2: 1.563 * 1.563 ≈ 2.444.

Wait, 1.563^2 = (1.5 +0.063)^2 ≈ 2.25 + 2*(1.5)(0.063) + 0.063² ≈ 2.25 + 0.189 + 0.003969 ≈ 2.442969. So approximately 2.443.

So 1/(gamma_A^2) = 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095.

So 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905. sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.7685. So v_A ≈ 0.7685 c, which is about 0.77c. So option A.

But wait, could there be another approach where the initial momentum is accounted for more accurately?

Wait, the initial momentum p_initial is gamma m_p v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so p_initial ≈ m_p v.

In the final state, each A has momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

If all four A's are moving in the same direction, then the total momentum is 4 p_A = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Setting this equal to p_initial:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v.

But from energy, we have gamma_A = 1.563. So:

4 * 1.563 * 300 * v_A = 938 * v.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So:

4 * 1.563 * 300 * v_A = 938 * v.

Compute the left side:

4 * 1.563 ≈ 6.252. 6.252 * 300 ≈ 1875.6.

So 1875.6 v_A = 938 v.

Divide both sides by v:

1875.6 v_A = 938 v.

So v_A = (938 / 1875.6) v ≈ (0.4997) v ≈ 0.5 v.

Wait, but that's not matching with the earlier calculation.

Wait, this suggests that v_A is approximately 0.5 times the initial velocity of the antiproton, but we need to find v_A in terms of c. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct because I'm mixing variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the momentum equation is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

But since v is small, gamma is approximately 1, so:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v.

But from energy, we have gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) )= m_p/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(600) ≈ 1.563.

So, gamma_A is known. Now,

v_A = [ (m_p v) / (4 gamma_A m_A) ) ].

But I don't know v yet. Wait, but perhaps I can express v in terms of beta_p (beta_p = v_p / c).

Wait, let me denote beta_p = v_p / c. So v_p = beta_p c.

Then, initial momentum p_initial = gamma_p m_p beta_p c.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, beta_p is small, so gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p^2)/2.

But perhaps for small beta_p, gamma_p ≈ 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p beta_p c.

Now, from the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p beta_p c.

But from energy:

gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p) / (2 m_A) ≈ 1.563.

So, gamma_A is known. Now, from gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_A^2/c^2), we can find v_A in terms of gamma_A.

Wait, but we have two equations:

1) 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p beta_p c.

2) gamma_A = m_p / (2 m_A).

So, substituting equation 2 into equation 1:

4 * (m_p/(2 m_A)) ) * m_A v_A = m_p beta_p c.

Simplify:

4 * ( m_p/(2 m_A) ) * m_A v_A = 4 * (m_p/2) v_A = 2 m_p v_A.

Set equal to m_p beta_p c:

2 m_p v_A = m_p beta_p c.

Divide both sides by m_p:

2 v_A = beta_p c.

So, beta_p = (2 v_A) / c.

But beta_p is small, so v_A must be small as well. Wait, but earlier I found v_A ≈ 0.77c, which is not small. Contradiction.

Wait, that's a problem. If beta_p is small, then v_A would be beta_p c / 2, which would also be small. But earlier calculations suggested v_A is around 0.77c, which is not small. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong somewhere.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, in the problem statement, the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the initial momentum p_initial is small compared to the rest mass. So, the initial momentum is gamma m_p v. Since v is small, p_initial is small.

But for the final state, the four A particles must have a total momentum of p_initial. If each A has momentum p_A, then 4 p_A = p_initial.

But p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

But the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

The final energy is E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A) ≈ 1.563.

So with gamma_A known, I can find v_A.

Wait, but in the momentum equation, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

We can express v as beta_p c.

So, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p beta_p c.

But from gamma_A = 1.563, we can solve for v_A.

Wait, but how do I connect beta_p with v_A? From the earlier equation, I had beta_p = 2 v_A / c.

So substituting into the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p (2 v_A / c) c.

The c's cancel:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = 2 gamma m_p v_A.

Divide both sides by v_A (assuming v_A ≠ 0):

4 gamma_A m_A = 2 gamma m_p.

Simplify: 2 gamma_A m_A = gamma m_p.

But from gamma_A = m_p/(2 m_A), substituting:

2 * (m_p/(2 m_A)) ) * m_A = gamma m_p → (m_p) = gamma m_p → gamma =1.

So gamma is 1, which would imply that the antiproton's velocity isn't that high, which makes sense because it's moving slowly.

Wait, but earlier I had gamma_A = 1.563, which would give v_A ≈ 0.77c, which is high. But according to this, gamma is 1, so beta_p is zero. Which can't be right because the antiproton is moving.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck in a loop here. Let me try another approach.

Assume that the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p, and the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

The final energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c², and the final momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Set E_initial = E_final and p_initial = p_final.

So:

E_initial: (1 + gamma_p) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

p_initial: gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

We can write these as:

(1 + gamma_p) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.   ...(1)

gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.  ...(2)

We have two equations and two unknowns (gamma_p and v_A). But perhaps I can express v_p in terms of gamma_p.

We know that gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_p²/c²)).

So, v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_p^2)).

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between the two.

From equation (1):

gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A ) / m_p - 1.

Let's call this equation (1a).

Substitute equation (1a) into equation (2).

But equation (2): gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So, v_p = [4 gamma_A m_A v_A ] / [gamma_p m_p ].

But v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2).

Hmm, substitute v_p from equation (1a):

gamma_p = [4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ] - 1.

So gamma_p = (4 gamma_A * 300 MeV/c² ) / (938 MeV/c² ) ) -1.

Wait, m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So gamma_p = (4 gamma_A * 300 ) / 938 - 1.

Simplify: (4 * 300 gamma_A ) = 1200 gamma_A.

1200 gamma_A / 938 ≈ 1.281 gamma_A.

So gamma_p ≈ 1.281 gamma_A -1.

But from equation (1a), gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A ) / m_p -1.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too convoluted. Maybe I can find a ratio.

Let me define variable x = gamma_A. So,

Equation (1): (1 + gamma_p) m_p = 4 x m_A.

Equation (2): gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 x m_A v_A.

Let me solve equation (1) for gamma_p:

gamma_p = (4 x m_A)/m_p -1.

Substitute this into equation (2):

[ (4 x m_A)/m_p -1 ] * m_p v_p = 4 x m_A v_A.

Simplify:

[4 x m_A - m_p ] v_p = 4 x m_A v_A.

Divide both sides by m_p:

[ (4 x m_A - m_p) / m_p ] v_p = (4 x m_A v_A ) / m_p.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express v_p in terms of v_A.

From equation (2):

v_p = [4 x m_A v_A ] / [ (4 x m_A - m_p) ].

But without knowing x, it's hard. Maybe I can substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2).

Wait, Equation (1): x = [ (1 + gamma_p) m_p ] / (4 m_A ).

Substitute x into equation (2):

gamma_p m_p v_p = 4 [ (1 + gamma_p) m_p / (4 m_A ) ] m_A v_A.

Simplify the RHS:

4 * (1 + gamma_p) m_p / (4 m_A ) * m_A v_A → (1 + gamma_p) m_p v_A.

So equation (2) becomes:

gamma_p m_p v_p = (1 + gamma_p) m_p v_A.

Divide both sides by m_p:

gamma_p v_p = (1 + gamma_p) v_A.

So,

v_p = [ (1 + gamma_p) / gamma_p ] v_A.

But v_p is the velocity of the antiproton, which is small, so v_p << c, so gamma_p ≈ 1.

So, v_p ≈ (2 / 1 ) v_A → v_A ≈ v_p / 2.

But wait, if v_p is small, then v_A is also small, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that v_A is about 0.77c.

So something's wrong here. Perhaps my initial approach of assuming all four A's have the same velocity is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Maybe the initial momentum is zero? No, because the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, so initial momentum is non-zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric, so the total momentum of the final particles is the same as the initial. But to find the velocity of each A, perhaps we can consider that each A's momentum contributes to the total, but their velocities are the same.

Wait, another angle: since the initial momentum is small (antiproton is moving slowly), perhaps the A's are moving relativistically, so their kinetic energy is significant, meaning their velocities are a significant fraction of c.

But I'm not seeing the clear path here. Let me try to find beta for the A particles using the earlier calculation where v_A was 0.77c, which is option A. But in that case, considering the momentum equation, with gamma_A ≈1.563, and m_A=300 MeV/c², let's compute the momentum.

p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A / c.

gamma_A=1.563, m_A=300 MeV/c², v_A=0.77c.

p_A = 1.563 * 300 * 0.77 * (MeV/c²) * (c) / c → 1.563 *300 *0.77 MeV/c.

Compute 1.563 *300 = 468.9.

468.9 * 0.77 ≈ 361.3 MeV/c.

So each A has momentum ≈361.3 MeV/c.

Total momentum of four A's: 4 *361.3 ≈ 1445.2 MeV/c.

But initial momentum p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p.

But if gamma_p ≈1, then p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

m_p is 938 MeV/c², so p_initial = 938 * v_p (in units where c=1, so v_p is in terms of c? Wait, no, units are important.

Wait, more accurately, since v_p is in terms of c, perhaps better to express in terms of beta_p.

p_initial = gamma_p m_p beta_p c.

But if antiproton is moving slowly, beta_p is small, so gamma_p ≈1.

So p_initial ≈ m_p beta_p c.

But in our earlier calculation, the total momentum of A's is 1445.2 MeV/c.

So equate:

m_p beta_p c = 1445.2 MeV/c.

Wait, m_p c is 938 MeV.

So,

938 beta_p = 1445.2 → beta_p ≈ 1445.2 /938 ≈ 1.54.

Wait, but beta_p can't be greater than 1 because beta is v/c. So that's impossible. This suggests that my earlier assumption that gamma_A=1.563 and v_A=0.77c leads to a beta_p greater than 1, which is impossible. So that indicates that my initial approach was wrong.

Hmm, so something is wrong. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: Let's consider the total energy and momentum in the center-of-momentum frame. But perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps using the invariant mass. The initial state consists of a proton (mass m_p) at rest and an antiproton (mass m_p) moving with velocity v. The invariant mass squared (s) is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

E_total = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

p_total = gamma m_p v.

So s = (m_p c² + gamma m_p c²)^2 - (gamma m_p v c )^2.

Let's compute s.

s = [m_p c² (1 + gamma )]^2 - [gamma m_p v c]^2.

Factor out (m_p c)^2:

s = (m_p c)^2 [ (1 + gamma )^2 c² - (gamma v )^2 ].

But we can write v in terms of gamma: v = c sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So v = c sqrt( (gamma^2 -1) / gamma^2 ) ) = c sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma.

So v = c (sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )) / gamma.

So v^2 = c² (gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma^2.

Now, substitute into s:

s = (m_p c)^2 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - (gamma^2 (gamma^2 -1 ) ) / gamma^2 ) ] c².

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute (gamma v)^2:

(gamma v)^2 = gamma² v² = gamma² (c² (gamma² -1 ) / gamma² ) )= c² (gamma² -1 ).

So, s = (m_p c² (1 + gamma ))^2 - (gamma m_p v c )^2.

= m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma )^2 - m_p^2 c^2 (gamma^2 (gamma² -1 )) )

Factor out m_p^2 c^4:

= m_p² c^4 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - (gamma² (gamma² -1 )) / c^2 ].

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute s as (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c )^2.

Since the proton is at rest, E1 = m_p c², p1=0.

E2 = gamma m_p c², p2 = gamma m_p v.

So,

s = (E1 + E2 )^2 - (p2 c )^2.

= [m_p c² (1 + gamma )]^2 - [gamma m_p v c ]^2.

= m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² m_p² v² c².

But v² = c² (1 - 1/gamma² ), so v² c² = c^4 (1 - 1/gamma² ).

Thus,

s = m_p² c^4 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² (1 - 1/gamma² ) ].

Expand the terms inside:

(1 + gamma )^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma².

gamma² (1 - 1/gamma² ) = gamma² -1.

So,

s = m_p² c^4 [ (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - (gamma^2 -1) ) ].

Simplify inside the brackets:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 +1 = 2 + 2 gamma.

So,

s = m_p² c^4 (2 (1 + gamma )).

So,

s = 2 m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma ).

But the invariant mass squared s must also equal the sum of the rest masses squared plus the kinetic energies in the center of mass frame. Wait, but in the final state, the particles are moving, so their invariant mass is the same as the initial state.

The final state has four A particles. The invariant mass squared s must also be equal to the sum of their rest masses squared plus their kinetic energies. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the invariant mass of the system is the sum of the A particles' rest masses plus their kinetic energy.

Wait, but perhaps the invariant mass of the system is the same as the initial s. So,

s = (sum E_final)^2 - (sum p_final c )^2.

But sum E_final is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

sum p_final is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

s = (4 gamma_A m_A c² )^2 - (4 gamma_A m_A v_A c )^2.

= 16 gamma_A² m_A² c^4 (1 - v_A²/c² ) 

= 16 gamma_A² m_A² c^4 (1/(gamma_A²) )

= 16 m_A² c^4.

So,

s = 16 m_A^2 c^4.

But from earlier, s is also 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma ).

So,

16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma )

Divide both sides by c^4:

16 m_A² = 2 m_p² (1 + gamma )

Simplify:

8 m_A² = m_p² (1 + gamma )

So,

1 + gamma = 8 m_A² / m_p².

Compute m_A and m_p:

m_p = 938 MeV/c².

m_A = 300 MeV/c².

So,

(8 * 300^2 ) / (938^2 ) = (8 * 90000) / (880,  938^2 is approx (900)^2=810,000, but more accurately: 938^2 = 880,  938*938= (900+38)^2 = 900² + 2*900*38 +38² = 810000 + 68400 + 1444 = 879844.

So,

8 * 300^2 =8 *90000=720,000.

m_p^2 =938^2=879,844.

So,

1 + gamma = 720000 / 879844 ≈ 0.8184.

Wait, that can't be right because 1 + gamma would be less than 1, which is impossible because gamma is at least 1.

Wait, something's wrong here. Let's see:

Wait, 8 m_A² = 8 * 300^2 =8*90000=720,000.

m_p^2 = 938^2= 879844.

So,

1 + gamma = 720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

Which is less than 1, implying 1 + gamma < 1 → gamma <0, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the invariant mass calculation.

Ah, wait, I think I messed up the invariant mass calculation for the final state.

Wait, the invariant mass squared s should be the same in both frames. The final state's invariant mass is the sum of the four A particles' energies squared minus their total momentum squared times c squared.

Wait, the invariant mass squared is:

s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c )^2.

E_total = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

p_total = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

s = (4 gamma_A m_A c^2 )^2 - (4 gamma_A m_A v_A c )^2.

Factor out (4 gamma_A m_A c )^2:

= (4 gamma_A m_A c )^2 [ c^2 - v_A^2 ] 

= (4 gamma_A m_A c )^2 ( c^2 (1 - (v_A^2/c^2 )) )

= (4 gamma_A m_A c )^2 ( c^2 (1/gamma_A^2) ) )

= (4 gamma_A m_A c )^2 ( c^2 / gamma_A^2 )

= (16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^2 ) ( c^2 / gamma_A^2 )

= 16 m_A^2 c^4.

So, s =16 m_A^2 c^4.

But from the initial state, s=2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma ), so:

16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma )

Divide both sides by c^4:

16 m_A^2 = 2 m_p² (1 + gamma )

So,

(1 + gamma ) = (16 m_A² ) / (2 m_p² ) ) = (8 m_A² ) / m_p².

Compute:

8 * (300)^2 =8*90000=720,000.

m_p^2= (938)^2=879,844.

So,

1+gamma = 720,000 /879,844 ≈ 0.818.

Again, this gives 1 + gamma ≈0.818, which is impossible because gamma is at least 1. So 1 + gamma can't be less than 2.

Hmm, this suggests that the invariant mass approach is leading to a contradiction, which indicates that perhaps the initial assumption of four particles all being A+ and A- is leading to a problem, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the invariant mass of the final state. Let me re-calculate the invariant mass squared s for the final state.

The invariant mass squared for the system is s = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c )^2.

sum E = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

sum p =4 gamma_A m_A v_A / c.

So,

sum p c =4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

s = (4 gamma_A m_A c² )^2 - (4 gamma_A m_A v_A )^2.

= 16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 - 16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 v_A^2.

Factor out 16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2:

= 16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 (c^4 - v_A^2 c^2 ).

=16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^2 (c² - v_A² ) .

=16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^2 (c^2 (1 - v_A²/c² )).

=16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 (1 - v_A^2/c^2 ).

But for each A particle, 1 - v_A^2/c^2 =1/(gamma_A^2).

So,

s =16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 (1/gamma_A^2 ) ) =16 m_A^2 c^4.

So, yes, correct.

Thus, 16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma ).

So,

16 m_A^2 = 2 m_p^2 (1 + gamma ).

Thus,

1 + gamma = 8 m_A² / m_p^2.

Which, as computed earlier, is 8*(300)^2/(938)^2 ≈ 8*90000/(879844).

Compute 8*90000=720000.

720000 / 879844 ≈ 0.818.

Which again gives 1 + gamma≈0.818, which is impossible.

So this suggests that perhaps the initial assumption of four A particles is incorrect, or perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the annihilation produces two A+ and two A- particles, but their invariant mass is such that s is larger than (sum m_A )².

Wait, perhaps the invariant mass s is (sum (m_A c² ))^2 plus some kinetic energy terms, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the velocity is determined by the condition that all A particles are created at rest. But that can't be right because the initial momentum would require the A's to have momentum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is non-relativistic, so we can use non-relativistic energy and momentum equations.

But the A particles are likely to be moving at relativistic speeds because their energy is significant compared to their rest mass.

Wait, the initial approach I took gave v_A ≈0.77c, which is option A. But according to the invariant mass, this leads to a contradiction. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial calculation, and the invariant mass approach isn't applicable here, perhaps due to the specific production mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption that the antiproton's velocity is very small leads to the conclusion that the A particles have a certain velocity, and the answer is option A.

But the invariant mass approach seems to indicate something impossible, which suggests that perhaps the calculation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the invariant mass approach should have the sum of the four A's rest masses squared. Wait, the sum of the rest masses is 4 *300=1200 MeV. So their rest mass squared is (1200)^2=1,440,000 MeV². The invariant mass squared s is 16*(300)^2=16*90,000=1,440,000 MeV². So s = (sum m_A c² )². So, the invariant mass is exactly the sum of the rest masses of the A particles. That makes sense because if all A particles are at rest, their invariant mass would be sum m_A c². But in reality, they have kinetic energy, so s must be larger than (sum m_A c² )².

Wait, but according to the calculation, s is 16 m_A^2 c^4 = (4 m_A c² )^2. So, it's equal to (sum m_A c² )^2, which would imply that all A particles are at rest. But that's not possible because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the A particles are all at rest, but that would violate momentum conservation since the initial momentum is non-zero.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should go back to the initial approach where gamma_A=1.563 gives v_A=0.77c, which is option A. But earlier, this led to a contradiction in the momentum equation, implying that beta_p>1, which is impossible.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in that earlier calculation. Let me recheck.

If from energy, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p )/(4 m_A )= m_p/(2 m_A )= 938/(600 )=1.563.

So, gamma_A=1.563.

So, v_A= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A² )) c.

Compute 1/gamma_A²=1/( (1.563)^2 )=1/2.443≈0.4095.

So 1-0.4095=0.5905.

sqrt(0.5905)=0.7685 → v_A≈0.7685c, which is approximately 0.77c.

But then, from the momentum equation,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_p m_p v_p.

But when I plugged in the numbers earlier, I found that gamma_p would have to be greater than 1, which is possible, but the antiproton's velocity would then be v_p= c sqrt(1 -1/gamma_p^2 ). But I'm not sure if that leads to any contradictions.

Wait, let me compute gamma_p.

From equation (1):

(1 + gamma_p ) m_p =4 gamma_A m_A.

gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) -1.

= (4 *1.563 *300 ) /938 -1.

Compute numerator:4 *1.563=6.252. 6.252 *300=1875.6.

1875.6 /938 ≈ 2.000.

So gamma_p ≈2.000 -1=1.

So gamma_p=1 → v_p=0, but the antiproton is moving, so this can't be right.

Wait, that's a problem. If gamma_p is 1, then the antiproton is at rest, which contradicts the problem statement that it's moving slowly.

Hmm, so this suggests that my initial approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the A particles are at rest, which would mean that their momentum is zero. But that can't be, because the initial momentum is non-zero.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps using the fact that in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero.

Wait, but the initial momentum isn't zero because the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore some factors, and the correct answer is 0.77c, option A.

Given that, and considering the time I've spent, I'll go with option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) under the given conditions. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to determine the velocity of the \( A \)-particles.

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the annihilation must be equal.
   - Initial energy: \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2 \), where \( m_p \) is the proton (and antiproton) mass, and \( \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v_p^2/c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor for the slow-moving antiproton.
   - Final energy: \( E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 \), where \( \gamma_A = 1/\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor for the \( A \)-particles.

   Since the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \gamma \approx 1 \), so:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 m_p c^2.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before and after the annihilation must be equal.
   - Initial momentum: \( p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma m_p v_p \), where \( v_p \) is the velocity of the antiproton.
   - Final momentum: \( p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A \), assuming all \( A \)-particles have the same velocity \( v_A \).

   Thus:
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = \gamma m_p v_p.
   \]

### Solving for \( v_A \)
Using energy conservation:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 \implies \gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
\]
Substituting \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.563.
\]

Now, solve for \( v_A \) using the relation \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \):
\[
\gamma_A^2 = \frac{1}{1 - v_A^2/c^2} \implies 1 - v_A^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}.
\]
\[
v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}.
\]
Substitute \( \gamma_A = 1.563 \):
\[
\gamma_A^2 \approx 1.563^2 \approx 2.443, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2} \approx 0.4095.
\]
\[
v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905 \implies v_A = \sqrt{0.5905} \, c \approx 0.7685 \, c.
\]
Thus, \( v_A \approx 0.77c \).

### Verification with Momentum Conservation
From momentum conservation:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = \gamma m_p v_p.
\]
Since \( \gamma \approx 1 \) (antiproton is slow), this simplifies to:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p.
\]
Substitute \( \gamma_A = 1.563 \), \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and \( v_A \approx 0.77c \):
\[
4 \times 1.563 \times 300 \times 0.77c = 938 \times v_p.
\]
\[
1875.6 \times 0.77c \approx 938 \times v_p \implies v_p \approx 1.5c.
\]
This result is unphysical because \( v_p > c \), indicating a contradiction. However, this discrepancy likely arises from the assumption that all \( A \)-particles have the same velocity, which may not hold in reality. Despite this, the velocity \( v_A \approx 0.77c \) aligns with the energy conservation calculation.

### Conclusion
The velocity of the \( A \)-particles is approximately \( 0.77c \), corresponding to **Option A**.
