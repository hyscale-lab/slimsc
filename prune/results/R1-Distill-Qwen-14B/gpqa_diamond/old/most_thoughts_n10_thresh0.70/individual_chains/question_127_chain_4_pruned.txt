Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. 

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes are heated, especially with certain structures, they can undergo a reaction. Oh right, it's probably a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction, but wait, wait. Oh wait, maybe it's a rearrangement? Like a hydride shift or something like that. Or wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that usually involves dienes and dienophiles. Or perhaps it's a simple isomerization or something else.

Wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me draw that structure. Nona is nine carbons. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. The substituent is a butyl group at position 5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the general formula for substituents is that the substituent's position is given by the lowest possible numbers. So butyl is a four-carbon chain.

Wait, wait, the molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So the main chain is nine carbons, with double bonds starting at C2 and C6. So positions 2-3 and 6-7 are double bonds. And at position 5, there's a butyl group attached.

Wait, let me write the structure. The main chain is nine carbons, with double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. At carbon 5, there's a butyl group. So the structure would look like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-C(5)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the main chain is nona, so it's nine carbons. The substituent is at position 5, which is the fifth carbon. So the structure is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Groups:    CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(butyl)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the main chain is nine carbons. So position 5
