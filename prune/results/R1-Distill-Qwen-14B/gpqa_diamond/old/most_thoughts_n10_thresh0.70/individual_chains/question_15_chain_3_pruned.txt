Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets have been detected via the RV method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The stars are different: the star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved. The question is which planet has a higher probability to transit, and the options give different probabilities.

Hmm, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, wait, I think the probability also depends on the orbital distance, or more precisely, the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Because if the planet's orbit is closer to the star, the chance that it passes in front from our point of view is higher.

Wait, the transit probability formula. I think the probability P is proportional to (R / a), where R is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital path that allows the transit. Let me think again. The transit probability for a planet is given by:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - eÂ²)^(1/2)) )

But wait, since both planets have circular orbits (e=0), this simplifies to (R_star + R_planet) / a.

But since Earth-like planets are small compared to stars, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the approximation would be R_star / a.

But wait, for the same star radius, the closer the planet is (smaller a), the higher the probability. Because dividing by a smaller a gives a larger P.

Wait, but in this case, the two stars have the same radius because both have the same R. Because the question says
