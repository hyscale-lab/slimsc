Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this pH problem. So, the question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that mixing acids and bases can lead to neutralization reactions. But I need to think carefully about how to approach this.

First, let me write down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, these are all in different volumes. So, mixing them will change the total volume and the concentrations of each. But first, I need to consider the reactions between these substances.

I know that HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it will dissociate completely as well.

So, when these are mixed together, I think the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. The reaction between acid and base is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other first. Then, any excess acid or base will determine the pH. If there's any weak acid left, that might contribute to the pH as well.

Let me calculate the moles of each H+ and OH-.

First, calculate moles:

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, Volume = 0.5 L
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. But wait, I might need to consider it after the strong acid and base have reacted.

For HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 0.4 L
Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is strong, it contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.
Molarity = 0.3 M, Volume = 0.3 L
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So, moles of OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's find the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from HCl, which is 0.08 moles, and any from CH3COOH (but probably negligible at this point, since we're dealing with strong acid and base neutralization first). The OH- is 0.18 moles.

When H+ and OH- react, they form water:
H+ + OH- → H2O

The amounts are:
H+ available: 0.08
OH- available: 0.18

So, the OH- is in excess. Let me calculate how much excess there is.

0.18 moles OH- minus 0.08 moles H+ gives 0.10 moles OH- remaining. Because 0.08 reacts, leaving 0.10.

But wait, what about the CH3COOH? After neutralization, we have excess OH- which is a strong base. So, the excess OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid if possible. Because acetic acid is a weak acid, but OH- is a strong base, so it will react.

So, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Let's see.

Reaction: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O

So, moles of OH- remaining after neutralization: 0.10 moles.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles.

So, OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05). Let's see, each OH- can take a proton from CH3COOH.

So, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

After that, how much OH- is left?

0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

So, the total solution after all reactions will have 0.05 moles of OH- in the total volume.

Wait, let me recap:

1. HCl gives 0.08 H+.
2. Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 OH-.
3. Neutralization: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.10 moles.
4. Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles CH3COOH can neutralize 0.05 OH-.
5. Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, now, the solution contains 0.05 moles of OH-.

But wait, what about the volume? The total volume is 500 +400 +300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667). Let me calculate that.

Wait, log(0.0416667) is log(1/24) since 1/24 ≈0.0416667.

Alternatively, 0.0416667 = 4.16667e-2.

Log(4.16667e-2) is log(4.1667) + log(1e-2). Log(4.1667) is about 0.6197. So 0.6197 -2 = -1.3803.

So, pOH is 1.3803.

Wait, no. Wait, pOH = -log([OH-]). So, [OH-] is 0.0416667 M.

So, taking negative log of that:

Let me compute it properly. 0.0416667 is 4.16667e-2.

Log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) = approximately 0.6197 - 2 = -1.3803.

Wait, but actually, 4.16667 is ~4.1667. Log(4)=0.6021, log(4.1667)= about 0.6198.

So, log(4.16667e-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So, pOH is -log(4.16667e-2) = 1.3802.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.3802 = 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second: Another thing to consider is whether the reaction of OH- with CH3COOH produces any additional H+ or OH-.

Wait, the reaction OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O. So, CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it can hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-.

So, this could produce more OH-, which would affect the pH.

Hmm, that's an important point. So, after the initial neutralization, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- from the excess Ba(OH)2 and also the acetate ions from the reaction with acetic acid.

Wait, but the acetate ion comes from the reaction of OH- with CH3COOH. Each mole of CH3COOH reacting with OH- produces a mole of acetate.

So, in this case, 0.05 moles of OH- reacted with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate.

So, the acetate will hydrolyze in water, producing OH-.

So, the solution now has some acetate ions that can contribute to the pH.

Hmm, so I think I need to account for that.

So, let me think again. The initial excess OH- is 0.05 moles. After that, the OH- reacts with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

Now, in solution, I have:

- 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- (acetate)
- The solution's total volume is 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of acetate is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, which has a pKa of about 4.76 (I remember that from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation). So, the pKa of acetic acid is around 4.76, so the pKb of acetate would be 14 - 4.76 = 9.24.

Wait, no: Kb is Kw / Ka. So, if Ka is 1.8e-5 for acetic acid, then Kb for acetate would be 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 ≈ 5.555e-10.

Wait, perhaps I should just calculate it.

Ka for CH3COOH is around 1.8 × 10^-5.

So, Kb for CH3COO^- is (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.5556e-10.

So, Kb is small, which means the hydrolysis of acetate in water is minimal. But let me proceed.

The acetate will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.5556e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.0416667 M.

Let me set up the expression.

Let x be the concentration of OH- produced from hydrolysis.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.0416667 - x ≈ 0.0416667 (since x will be very small)
[CH3COOH] = x
[OH^-] = x

So, Kb = (x^2) / (0.0416667) ≈ 5.5556e-10.

So, x^2 = 5.5556e-10 * 0.0416667 ≈ 5.5556e-10 * 4.16667e-2 ≈ 2.3148e-11.

x = sqrt(2.3148e-11) ≈ 4.81e-6 M.

So, [OH^-] from acetate hydrolysis is about 4.81e-6 M.

But wait, earlier, we had 0.05 moles of OH- remaining, which is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

So, the initial OH- concentration is about 0.0416667 M. Then, the acetate contributes an additional 4.81e-6 M. Let's see how much that adds.

So, total [OH^-] ≈ 0.0416667 + 0.00000481 ≈ 0.0416715 M.

Which is almost negligible compared to the initial 0.0416667. So, the contribution from acetate is minimal.

Therefore, I can probably ignore it, but perhaps it's worth checking.

Alternatively, I can calculate the exact [OH^-] considering both sources.

Wait, but perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the acetate doesn't contribute significantly.

Alternatively, maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the initial moles of OH- after reaction.

Let me double-check the initial moles:

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol HCl → 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L *0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

So, OH- is 0.18, H+ is 0.08.

Reaction between H+ and OH-: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH- → H2O. Remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, the OH- will react with acetic acid.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol.

So, OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05). So, all the CH3COOH is neutralized, and 0.05 moles of OH- are used. So, remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.

So, in the solution, I have 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Wait, but wait, the reaction with OH- and CH3COOH also produces acetate ions. So, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

But, as I thought earlier, the acetate will hydrolyze, but the contribution is small.

So, the total [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M plus a small amount from acetate.

But maybe I can ignore that small amount for simplicity. Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation was correct, and the pH is ~12.62.

Looking back at the options, option A is 12.62, which would be correct.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps I miscalculated the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Let me recheck:

HCl: 0.4 L × 0.2 = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L ×0.3 =0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

Then, neutralization gives 0.08 H+ and 0.08 OH- reacting, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, OH- reacts with 0.05 CH3COOH, producing 0.05 CH3COO^-.

So, after all reactions, the solution has:

- 0.05 mol OH- (from excess)
- 0.05 mol CH3COO^- (from the reaction)
- And any remaining H+?

Wait, no, after the initial neutralization, all H+ from HCl is used, and some OH- is left.

Wait, but the CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of excess OH-, it is deprotonated. So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid completely.

Wait, no. Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so OH- is a strong base. So, OH- will deprotonate CH3COOH:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, how much OH- is consumed in this reaction?

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol. So, 0.05 mol OH- will be consumed to neutralize it. So, initial OH- is 0.10 mol. After reaction, remaining OH- is 0.10 -0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So, the solution now has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L, which is 0.0416667 M.

So, [OH-] = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH =14 -1.38 =12.62.

So, the pH is approximately 12.62.

But wait, I thought earlier that the acetate would hydrolyze a little, adding a tiny bit more OH-.

But let's calculate if that's significant.

[CH3COO^-] is 0.05 mol /1.2 L ≈0.0416667 M.

The Kb of acetate is 5.56e-10.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration:

x²/(0.0416667) =5.56e-10.

x² =5.56e-10 *0.0416667 ≈2.3168e-11.

x= sqrt(2.3168e-11)= about 4.81e-6 M.

So, [OH^-] from hydrolysis is 4.81e-6 M.

The [OH^-] from excess OH- is 0.0416667 M.

So, total [OH^-] is approx 0.0416667 + 4.81e-6 ≈ 0.041715 M.

The difference is negligible, so the pOH is ~1.38, and pH is ~12.62.

So, the correct answer is option A) 12.62.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again—could I have missed any other reaction?

Wait, what about the possibility of some H+ remaining from CH3COOH reacting with the excess OH-? No, because the OH- is a strong base and would deprotonate all the weak acid.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the presence of both OH- and acetate.

But since OH- is a strong base, it's much more concentrated than the acetate, so the pH will be dominated by the OH- concentration.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 12.62, which matches option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases, calculate the remaining moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻), and then compute the pH.

### Given Data:
1. **CH₃COOH**: 500 mL of 0.1 M  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid and does not fully dissociate.

2. **HCl**: 400 mL of 0.2 M  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺.

3. **Ba(OH)₂**: 300 mL of 0.3 M  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

### Reaction Between H⁺ and OH⁻:
The strong acid (H⁺) and strong base (OH⁻) neutralize each other:
\[
\text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}
\]
- Initial moles of H⁺ = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Initial moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
- After neutralization, \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ remains.

### Reaction Between Excess OH⁻ and CH₃COOH:
The remaining \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:
\[
\text{OH⁻} + \text{CH₃COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}
\]
- Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
- \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH, leaving \( 0.08 - 0.05 = 0.03 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

### Total OH⁻ in Solution:
After all reactions, the solution contains:
- Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.03 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total volume = \( 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.03}{1.2} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

### pOH and pH:
1. \( \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.025) \).  
   Using \( \log(0.025) = \log(2.5 \times 10^{-2}) = \log(2.5) + \log(10^{-2}) = 0.3979 - 2 = -1.6021 \):  
   \( \text{pOH} = 1.6021 \).

2. \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.6021 = 12.3979 \).  
   Rounding to two decimal places, \( \text{pH} \approx 12.40 \).

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.40**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
