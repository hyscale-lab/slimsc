Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it through. Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it compares to an exoplanet in terms of brightness variation. 

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. Its effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, when the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically. The question is, if this brightness variation was instead caused by an exoplanet transiting the star, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star?

Wait, the problem says "if the star was not covered by spots!". That's an important condition. So in the 'normal' case without spots, what's the signal amplitude? And we need to find the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude.

First, I need to understand how the star's brightness varies due to the spots. Since the spots are cooler, when they're facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer than when they're on the far side. The photometric time series will show this as a dip in brightness each rotation period.

But without spots, the variation would be due to a planet blocking part of the star's disk. The amplitude of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So the key is to compute the relative change in brightness in both scenarios and set them equal.

Let me jot down the important variables:

- Star radius (Rstar) = R_sun
- Spot filling factor (f) = 20% = 0.2
- Star's effective temperature (Teff) = 6000 K
- Spot temperature (Tspot) = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K
- Planet radius (Rpl) is what we're solving for. We need Rpl/Rstar.

The brightness variation caused by spots (ﾎ認_spot) would be the difference in flux when spots are visible. Similarly, the variation caused by a planet (ﾎ認_planet) is the area blocked times the star's flux per unit area.

Wait, but the total flux from the star isn't just a uniform brightness. The spots are cooler, so when they're in view, the total flux is less. So the change in flux is the area of the spots times (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^2), because flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4. Oh wait, the flux from a spot is (T_spot / T_star)^4 times the flux from the rest of the star, but since the spot is cooler, it's (something less than 1) factor.

Wait, let's think about it. The star's total flux without any spots is F = ﾏサeff^4. If a certain fraction of the star's surface is covered by spots, each spot has a temperature Tspot.

So the total flux observed when the spots are visible (but on the same side as us) is F' = F * (1 - f) + F * f * (Tspot^4 / Teff^4). Because the unspotted area contributes F*(1-f), and the spotted area contributes F*(f) multiplied by the ratio of their fluxes.

So the change in flux is ﾎ認_spot = F - F' = F * [1 - (1 - f + f*(Tspot^4 / Teff^4)))] = F * [f * (1 - Tspot^4 / Teff^4)].

But wait, the change when the spots are facing us is a decrease in flux. The maximum dip in brightness would be when the spots are fully visible. But since the star is rotating, the spots are only visible when they're on the near side. But the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. Hmm, does that mean that the spots are all on one side, so when it's facing us, the spots are visible, but when it's rotated 180 degrees, the spots are on the far side, so their contribution is zero? Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, the spots would be on one side, but as it rotates, the spots would come into view as a partial coverage.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots. So the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, but all on one side. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view as a partial disk. So the maximum coverage is when the center of the spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when it's edge-on (so only a small part of the spots is visible). But perhaps this is more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the spots are spread across one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots move in and out of view, but the maximum coverage is when the center of the spot region is facing us. Hmm, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the total area of spots is 0.2 times the star's surface, regardless of their position on the star.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a simplified model where all the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star is rotating, the spots rotate into and out of view, but the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the maximum area of spots is visible. Alternatively, perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to be visible only when the star is in a certain orientation, but the calculation here might just consider the total area of spots, regardless of rotation.

Wait, but the problem says that the photometric time-series will show periodic variations due to rotational modulation. So the spots must be arranged such that as the star rotates, the observed flux changes as spots come into view. But the key point is that the spots
