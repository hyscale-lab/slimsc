Alright, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me try to unpack what's going on here. Okay, let's read the question carefully.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integral together is correct, but they're split into two. The question says that spin-spin coupling can be ruled out as the cause. Hmm, why?

Well, spin-spin coupling (like between neighboring protons) usually leads to splitting of the peaks. If the peaks are due to coupling, each would have a different shift and maybe a different integral. But the integral here sums to 1H, so maybe it's not coupling. So, what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Looking at the options, option B is about enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same NMR spectrum. Wait, but in that case, wouldn't the NMR show a single peak for each proton? Because enantiomers are identical in their environment, so same shifts. So that might not explain two peaks. Unless... the compound is a racemic mixture and there's some issue with the NMR setup. But in a racemic mixture, the NMR would usually just show the same as a pure sample because the peaks overlap. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option D is diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would differ. If the compound is a mix of diastereomers, each would have different proton environments. So, the same alpha-proton in different diastereomers would give different shifts. But wait, the question says the peaks have similar chemical shifts. If it's diastereomers, their shifts might be somewhat similar but not exactly the same. Also, diastereomers would have different coupling patterns if the protons are in different environments. But in this case, the coupling was ruled out. Hmm, not sure yet.

Another option: option A is contamination with a precursor. If the crude compound still has some precursor (like a starting material), then that would show up as additional peaks. But the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. Wait, the LC-MS is showing two peaks with same mass. So if it's a precursor, the mass would be different. So that probably isn't the case. So A is probably not correct.

Option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, double coupling... I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, some protons are involved in more than one coupling, but I'm not familiar with that term. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the amide protons being split due to some other reason. Wait, but the question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So maybe it's not coupling between protons.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Since it's a dipeptide or something similar, the alpha protons are typically near the amide groups. So perhaps the issue is with the amide protons themselves. But wait, in a peptide, the amide protons are usually deshielded and appear as broad peaks or downfield. But in this case, the alpha-proton is split into two. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a racemic mixture (which is option B), but as I thought before, racemic mixtures have identical NMR spectra, so that wouldn't lead to two peaks. Unless the sample is not pure but has some diastereomers, which is option D. But diastereomers would have different chemical shifts.

Wait, but the problem states that the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So if the shifts are very
