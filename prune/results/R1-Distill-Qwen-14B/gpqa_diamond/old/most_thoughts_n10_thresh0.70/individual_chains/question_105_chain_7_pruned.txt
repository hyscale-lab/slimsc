Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see. Okay, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and some spots on it, and how that would affect the brightness variations observed. Then, it's asking what radius an exoplanet would need to have to produce the same signal in the light curve.

So, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. Wait, the Sun's radius is about 696,000 km. But I don't think I need the exact number because maybe I can work with relative ratios.

The star has a hemisphere covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Filling factor I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by the spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered in spots. Oh wait, no. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots, so the total area would be half the star's surface. If the filling factor is 20%, that's 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (πR²/2), because a hemisphere is half the star's surface area.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, right? Because dark spots usually are cooler. The temperature difference is 1000 K. So if the star's Teff is 6000, the spots would be at 5000 K?

Wait, the
