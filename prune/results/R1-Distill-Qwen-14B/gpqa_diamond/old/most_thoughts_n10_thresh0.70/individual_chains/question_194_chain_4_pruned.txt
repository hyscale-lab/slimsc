Alright, so I'm trying to solve this partition function problem. Okay, let's see what the question says. We have three spins, S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So first, I need to figure out all the possible states and their corresponding energies.

Wait, each spin can be either +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3). Possible values for each are ±1.

So the states are:
1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to calculate E. Let's compute each one.

But wait, maybe I can find a smarter way instead of computing all 8, perhaps by grouping states with the same energy. That would save time.

Looking at the energy expression: E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Let me think about what each term S1S2 etc. represents.

Each product S_i S_j will be +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if different.

So let's compute each term for each state.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the number of pairs that are aligned (same spin) or anti-aligned.

Wait, another approach: think about the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote this sum as H. So E = -J H.

Each term in H is 1 if the spins are same, -1 otherwise.

So H = (S1S2) + (S1S3) + (S2S3). Each of these terms is either +1 or -1.

So H can range from -3 to +3, but let me see.

Wait, for all spins same: each term is 1, so H = 3. Then E = -J *3.

If two are same and one different, like two +1 and one -1: Let's pick state (+1, +1, -1). Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Thus E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait another example: state (+1, -1, -1). S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = 1. So H = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. So E = J again.

Wait, so in states where two are same and one different, H is -1. So E = J * 1.

What about all spins opposite? Like (-1,-1,-1): all terms are 1, H=3, E=-3J.

Wait another case: two spins opposite, and the third different. Wait, for example: (+1, -1, +1). So S1S2 = -1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=-1. H= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. So E= J.

Wait, but what about a state like (+1, -1, -1)? Let me compute H: S1S2 is (-1), S1S3 is (-1)*(+1) = -1,
