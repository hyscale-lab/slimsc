Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, muons are elementary particles similar to electrons but heavier, so I guess their angular momentum properties are similar. 

The problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay, which satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ. So we need to find the eigenvalues (a) and eigenvectors (φ) of Ay.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by a matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I can write S as:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Then Ay is c multiplied by S. So let me compute that. Since c is h/(4π), the matrix Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
                      [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, since c is a scalar, multiplying each element by c. Oh right, so each entry in S is multiplied by c. So the matrix would be:

Ay = [ [0, -i * c],
        [i * c, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π), so that's:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay acting on the eigenvector φ equals a φ. So to find the eigenvalues a, I need to solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix (Ay - a I):

[ -a,          (-i h)/(4π)       ]
[ (i h)/(4π),  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ) ] = a² - [ (i)(-i) * (h²)/(16π²) ) ]

Calculating that, since i * (-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So:

Determinant = a² - (h²/(16π²))*1 = 0

So the equation is a² = h²/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait wait, that can't be right. Let me check the calculation again. The determinant is:

(-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (i * -i) * h²/(4π)^2 ]

i * -i is -i², which is -(-1)=1. So the determinant is a² - [ (1) * h²/(16π²) ].

So a² = h²/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. Hmm, but let me think again: wait, the matrix Ay is actually a Hermitian matrix? Because angular momentum components are Hermitian operators. So eigenvalues should be real, which matches our calculation here.

Wait, but looking at the options given, let me check.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). But my calculation says that the eigenvalues are real, so imaginary part is zero. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: The eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1. Hmm, not matching, since according to my calculation, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). Unless I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the matrix. Oh wait, S is given as [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]. So when you multiply by c, which is h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

But wait, I think I might have missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Wait, let me think about the definition of the spin matrices. For a spin-1/2 particle, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y, where σ_y is [ [0, -i], [i,
