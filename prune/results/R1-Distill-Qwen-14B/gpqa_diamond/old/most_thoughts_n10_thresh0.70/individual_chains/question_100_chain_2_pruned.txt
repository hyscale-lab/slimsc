Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound starts as Compound A, which is C3H6. Wait, C3H6 isn't just one compound because there are two possible structures: propene (which is an alkene) and propyne (which is an alkyne). But wait, wait, no, wait. Propene is C3H6? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3, which has the formula C3H6. Propyne would be HCâ‰¡CCH3, which is also C3H6. So, the starting material could be either an alkene or alkyne.

But when it undergoes bromination in CCl4, that suggests an addition reaction. Bromination in CCl4 is typically for alkenes, adding bromine across the double bond. For alkynes, bromination might be different. So perhaps A is an alkene, so it's propene.

Wait, but propene is C3H6. When you brominate propene, it would add bromine across the double bond. So propene + Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, maybe it's 1,2-dibromopropane. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 in CCl4 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2CHBrCH3.
