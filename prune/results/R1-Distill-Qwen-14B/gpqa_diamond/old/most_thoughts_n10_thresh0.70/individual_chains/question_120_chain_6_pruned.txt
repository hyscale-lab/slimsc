Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. The parallax formula is something like plx = 1/distance, but wait, what's the exact relation? Oh right, parallax in arcseconds (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs (d). So plx = 1/d. That makes sense because if a star is closer (smaller d), its parallax is larger, and vice versa.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's asking how the density of stars changes with parallax. The options are all in terms of 1 over plx raised to some power. I think I need to find how the number of stars in a given parallax range (like from plx to plx + dplx) depends on plx.

Wait, the number of stars in a certain volume probably depends on the volume. So maybe I should think about the volume of space that corresponds to a certain parallax. Let's see, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars.

If I have a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding range in distance? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So at a given plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. Let's think about the distance range. If plx increases by dplx, then the distance decreases. Let me compute the distance range for two parallaxes.

At plx = p, the distance is d = 1/p. For plx = p + Δp, the distance is d' = 1/(p + Δp). So the distance range is from d = 1/p to d' = 1/(p + Δp). Wait, but when plx increases, distance decreases. So the actual range in distance is from d' to d, which is 1/(p + Δp) to 1/p. The thickness in distance for a given Δp would be approximately Δd ≈ (d - d') = 1/p - 1/(p + Δp). Let's compute that.

Let me calculate that difference. 1/p - 1/(p+Δp) = ( (p + Δp) - p ) / [p(p + Δp)] ) = Δp / [p(p + Δp)] ≈ Δp / p² (since if Δp is small compared to p, the denominator is roughly p squared). So Δd ≈ (Δp) / p².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of a shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, assuming a uniform distribution of stars. So N ∝ volume = 4πd² dd.

But we need the number of stars per unit parallax change. So let's think in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me express everything in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because d is 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dplx. But I'm looking for the number of stars per unit plx. So for a small change in plx (dplx), I need to find the range in distance that corresponds to that. Let's say I have a small change dplx, then the corresponding change in d is dd = - (1/p²) dplx. Since when plx increases, d decreases, so the shell in d goes from d to d + dd.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If plx increases by dplx, then the distance changes from d = 1/p to d' = 1/(p + dplx). So the difference in
