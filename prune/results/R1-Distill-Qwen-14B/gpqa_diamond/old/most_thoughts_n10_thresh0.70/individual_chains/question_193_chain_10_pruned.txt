Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, the formula we're given is number of stars N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant. Because parallax plx is 1/distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

So substituting that in, plx^5 would be (1/r)^5, which is 1/(r^5). So N = k * r^5, because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5.

Wait, no wait. Let me get this right. N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Plx is 1/r, so plx = 1/r. Then 1/plx^5 would be (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5? That seems steep.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so it's the rate of change, like the derivative. Because the number of stars in a small range dr around r would be something like N dr, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, since N is proportional to r^5, the number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to r. Let me think, if N = C * r^5, then dN/dr = 5 C r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with r^4. So the answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx⁵. Since plx = 1/r, 1/plx⁵ = r⁵. So N ∝ r⁵. So the total number of stars up to distance r is proportional to r⁵.

But the question is asking how the number of
