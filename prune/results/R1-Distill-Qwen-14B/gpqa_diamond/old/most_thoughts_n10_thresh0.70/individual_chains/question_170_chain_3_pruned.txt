Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I think that notation means the spin state vector is a two-component vector where the first component is 3i and the second is 4. So the state vector χ is (3i, 4)^T, right?

The question is asking for the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, which is S_y. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula ⟨S⟩ = ⟨χ| S |χ⟩. So I need to find ⟨S_y⟩.

Wait, what's S_y in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operator S_y for a spin-½ particle is (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. The sigma_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So the plan is to compute the expectation value by taking the conjugate transpose of χ, multiplying by S_y, and then multiplying by χ. Let me write this out.

First, let me write the state vector χ. It's [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose, which I'll denote as χ†, would be [ -3 (since the conjugate of 3i is -3), 4 ].

Wait, no, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i. Wait, no, wait. Let's see: 3i is a purely imaginary number. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i. Oh wait, no, wait again. The complex conjugate of a + ib is a - ib. So 3i is 0 + i*3, so its conjugate is 0 -i*3, which is -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait a second, wait. Let me make sure. The original state is (3i,4). So when we take the conjugate, we have to take the complex conjugate of each component. So the first component is 3i, which becomes -3i. The second component is 4, which is real, so it remains 4. So χ† is the row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

Now the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is χ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ. Let me compute this step by step.

Let me write S_y again: S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I do χ† * S_y, that's a 1x2 vector multiplied by a 2x2 matrix, resulting in a 1x2 vector.

So let me compute χ† multiplied by S_y. So let's compute each element.

χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Multiplying this by S_y:

First element: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) ) → Wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication is done as row times column. So each element of the resulting vector is the sum of products of elements from χ† and S_y.

Wait, let me think again. The multiplication is (χ†) * S_y. So for the first element of the resulting vector, it's χ†_1 * S_y[1,1] + χ†_2 * S
