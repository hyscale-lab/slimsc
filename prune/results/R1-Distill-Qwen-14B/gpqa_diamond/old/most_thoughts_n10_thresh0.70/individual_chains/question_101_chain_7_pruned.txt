Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find the right reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. Let me see. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a pyrrolidine ring with a methyl group on the third carbon. So it's a five-membered amine ring. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the first carbon. Wait, cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene ring (with a double bond), right? So the product is like the pyrrolidine with a substituent that's a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene ring. So it's a ring expansion or some kind of addition?

The reaction is acid-catalyzed. So what kind of reactions happen under acid conditions with amines? I remember that Hunsdiecker reaction is for halides, but that's not it. Oh, maybe it's a type of alkylation or perhaps an elimination?

Wait, another thought: in acid conditions, amines can act as nucleophiles. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Let me think about the product. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So, the pyrrolidine's ring is probably opening and then something is adding on.

Wait, when amines react with carbonyl compounds, under certain conditions, they can undergo various reactions. For example, in the presence of acid, maybe it's a condensation reaction. Like the formation of an imine or something similar. Or perhaps it's an aldol-like addition.

Wait, but the product has an alkene. Oh, wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl has a double bond. So the product is a bicyclic compound? Or maybe it's a ring expansion via an enamine formation.

Wait, enamine synthesis! Yes, that rings a bell. Enamines are formed from a ketone or
