Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking me to arrange six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo bromination with excess bromine. Wait, so each of these is a benzene derivative, right? And when bromine does electrophilic substitution, it adds a bromine atom to the ring.

The structures given are:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl benzene, toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl benzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, number 5 is ethyl benzene, but isn't that a possible confusion? Because sometimes, substituents like ethyl groups can have different directing effects. But wait, benzene rings are symmetric, so maybe each substituent directs the incoming electrophile to specific positions.

Electrophilic substitution reactions depend on the substituents' directing effects. Substituents can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions (ortho, para for activating; meta for deactivating). Deactivating groups make the ring less reactive but still direct.

Let me recall: 

- Electron-donating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3) are activating and ortho/para directors.
- Electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, -X [halogens]) are deactivating and meta directors.

Wait, but wait. Halogens are a bit tricky. They are slightly deactivating (due to the electronegative nature), but they are ortho/para directors because the lone pairs on the substituent can donate electrons through resonance. Wait, no, wait. Wait, halogens are ortho/para directors but deactivating because the inductive effect outweighs the resonance effect. So, for example, chlorobenzene's Cl is ortho/para directing but deactivating.

So for each substituent, let's determine if they're activating or deactivating and their directing.

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl group is an activating group (since it's electron-donating via +I effect), so ortho/para directing.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: the substituent is COOEt (ester group). Esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. COOR is a meta director.

3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is a substituent. As a halogen, it's a deactivating (because of the inductive effect) but ortho/para director.

4) C6H5-NO2: nitro group is a strong deactivating group and meta director.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl group is a activating group (electron-donating via +I), so it's an ortho/para director.

6) C6H5-COOH: carboxylic acid group, which is deactivating (electron-withdrawing) and meta director.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each compound, when bromine is added, the major product's position depends on the substituent's directing.

But wait, the para isomer's weight fraction. So, when a substituent directs the incoming bromine to multiple positions, the major product distribution varies.

Wait, if a substituent is a strong meta director, then the incoming electrophile will go to the meta positions, so the para isomer may not be as favored. Conversely, if the substituent is a
