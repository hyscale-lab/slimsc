Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and I need to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are given, each showing the transition and the type of particle emitted.

Hmm. So first, let me break down the information. The initial state is 1S0. So the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). Wait, no, the question says that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), where S is total spin, L is orbital angular momentum in spectroscopic notation, and J is total angular momentum.

Wait, but in the initial state, it's 1S0. So 1 is (2S+1), which implies 2S+1=1. So S must be 0. Because 2(0)+1=1. So S=0. Then, the L is S, which is the orbital part. So L=0 because the term is 1S, meaning S=0? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is written as (2S+1)L0. So 1S0. So S is the spin, L is the orbital. So S=0, L=0? Because S is the spin quantum number, and L is the orbital. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

Wait, because J is S + L, but since both are zero, J=0. So initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, the system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Let's
