Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, the problem says the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere and the ionization of elements like titanium?

Oh right, the photosphere's effective temperature is what affects the ionization state of atoms. When a star has spots, the overall brightness changes because the spots are cooler. So the star's total luminosity must decrease when spots are present. But wait, the problem is about the photospheric effective temperature when the spots are present. Oh, so the Teff is now 5500 K overall. So the photosphere is cooler when spots are present.

In the stellar photosphere, they're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is N1/N2, where N1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and N2 in level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. They're asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So N1/N2 is lower when the star is spotted. So when no spots, N1/N2 is higher. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots. That would be the ratio when no spots over when with spots.

But wait, the ratio depends on the temperature because the number of atoms in each level is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Assuming that the energy difference (Î”E = E
