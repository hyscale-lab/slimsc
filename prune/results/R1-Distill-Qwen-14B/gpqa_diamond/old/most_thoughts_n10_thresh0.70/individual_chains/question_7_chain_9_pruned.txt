Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking, at what energy do the lifetimes of gamma-rays get limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are in the GeV range, which is like really high energy.

Wait, I remember that when a high-energy photon interacts with another photon, like a CMB photon, it can produce an electron-positron pair if the energy is sufficient. But for that to happen, they must meet certain conditions, probably related to their combined energy. Oh right, this has to do with the threshold energy for pair production.

The threshold condition occurs when the combined energy is just enough to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so two of them would be 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's the total rest energy. But how does that translate into photon energies?

Oh wait, I think the formula involves the product of the photon energies being at least the square of the electron mass energy. Because in the center-of-momentum frame, the energy must be sufficient. So the condition is that the product of the two photon energies must be greater than or equal to (m_e c^2)^2, where m_e is the electron mass.

So the formula would be E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, but the CMB photons have an average energy, which is given as 1e-3 eV. So E_cmb is 1e-3 eV. So rearranging the equation, E_gamma must be (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

But wait, let me get the units right. m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. Squared, that's (0.511e6 eV)^2. Let's compute that: (0.511)^2 is roughly 0
