Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is. We need to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll start by looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, O=2, N=1.

DoU = (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2 = 3. So three degrees of unsaturation, which could mean three rings, or a combination like a ring and double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (which has three DoU by itself) plus maybe an ester group.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H or O-H stretches. But for O-H, the absorption is usually broader and around 3200-3600. However, the 1720 cm-1 peak is strong, which suggests a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide). Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1750, so that fits.

Now the 1H NMR:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. This is probably a methyl group attached to something, like OCH2CH3 or CH2CH3. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2, which is common in ethyl groups. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad signals can be from NH groups (like amines or amides), but in this case, how many Hs? Two, so maybe a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom or a group like NH. Wait, but if it's a singlet and broad, perhaps it's an NH2 group, but wait, the molecule has N as well. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group. Wait, but in amides, NH groups can be broad. Let me think.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a group that has two neighboring protons. Like a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe OCH2CH2... like in an ethyl ester. For example, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet for the OCH2, but wait, their shifts might be a bit different. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.

The aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two Hs on each substituent are equivalent and show as doublets. So the benzene has two substituents, each para to each other. Like two groups attached in the para positions, maybe an amino and another group, or two substituents in para.

Wait, but the options include things like benzamide, formamide, propionate, and ethyl benzoate. Let me look at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. But the substituents would not be para in that case.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is attached to the benzene at the para position where there's an ethoxy group. So benzene has two substituents: ethoxy and formamide, para to each other.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So benzene with amino group in position 4 and a propionate (like CH2CH2COO-) attached as an ester or acid. Wait, propionate is like CH2CH2COO- as an ester or acid. The amino would be in position 4.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester is attached to ethyl, and the amino group is in the para position on the benzene.

Hmm. Let's think about the NMR.

Looking at the NMR signals again. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) suggests an ethyl group, maybe OCH2CH3 or CH3CH2-O-. So ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be OCH2CH3, where the OCH2 would show as a quartet. Wait, but the ethyl group (CH2CH3) usually has the CH2 as a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm, and the CH3 as a triplet at 1.2-1.4 ppm. So in an ethoxy group, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet around 4.0 ppm and the CH3 at 1.2 ppm. But wait, in the NMR provided, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), and the triplet is at 1.20 ppm (3H). So that fits with an ethyl group, but perhaps as part of an ester.

Wait, but in an ethyl ester, like OEt in COOEt, the OCH2CH3 would be split into a quartet for the OCH2, which is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm. So 4.5 is a bit higher than that, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an amide or another electronegative group.

The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be a NH2 group, but wait, the integration is 2H, so perhaps a CH2NH or something. Or maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures.

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O

Benzoate ester: benzene ring with COOEt and NH2 groups in para positions.

So the benzoate would be in para to the amino group.

In that case, the NMR would show the COOEt group. The COO- part is esterified with ethyl. So the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet around 4.0-4.3, and the CH3 as triplet at 1.2. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2. So that's a bit higher than usual. Also, the amino group would show as NH2, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, if it's NH2, that's usually a broad peak, but perhaps in this case, it's a different environment.

Wait, but in D, the ethyl group would be part of the ester. The ethyl ester's OCH2 would be around 4.2 ppm, but this is 4.5. So perhaps the shift is a bit upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl is part of an ethoxy group attached to the benzene. Let's see.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is benzene with ethoxy at position 4 and formamide (HCONH-). So the formamide has the NH group.

In the NMR, the ethoxy group would have OCH2CH3, so the CH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3, and CH3 triplet at 1.2. So that matches the NMR: 1.20 (t, 3H), 4.5 (q, 2H). Wait, but the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is higher than usual for OCH2. Hmm.

In option D, the ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3. So if the ester is attached to the carbonyl, the OCH2 would be at around 4.2, but it's at 4.5 here. Alternatively, maybe the coupling is with something else.

Wait, what about the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs). Broad singlet could be an NH group, but two
