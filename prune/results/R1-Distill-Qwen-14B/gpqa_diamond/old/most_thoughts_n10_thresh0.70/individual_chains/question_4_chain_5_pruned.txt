Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, the question is about a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. That means in this universe, the concept of magnetic monopoles exists, right? Because in our real world, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate just one.

Wait, Maxwell's equations... I remember they are four fundamental equations in electromagnetism. Let me recall each one. Oh right, they're about electric and magnetic fields, their sources and curls and stuff.

So the original Maxwell's equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. This relates the divergence of the electric field to the charge density.

2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0. This one says there are no isolated magnetic charges, so the divergence of B is zero.

3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This is about the curl of the electric field induced by a changing magnetic field.

4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. This relates the curl of the magnetic field to current and the rate of change of electric displacement.

Now, in our universe, equation 2 holds because we don't have magnetic monopoles. But in this parallel universe, they do. So equation 2 would change. Instead of ∇·B = 0, it would be something else. Probably ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density, similar to how ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ for electric charges.

So which equations are affected? Let's think. Equation 2 definitely changes because it deals with the divergence of B.

What about the others? Faraday's Law (equation 3) and Ampère's Law (equation 4) might also change. Wait, wait. Oh no, wait. Maxwell's equations also include the concept of displacement current in Ampère's Law, but does that relate to magnetic monopoles?

Wait, another thought: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, how do the equations change? I think the modifications involve both Gauss's law for magnetism and Ampère's law, but wait, maybe Faraday's Law as well. Or perhaps Faraday's Law and Ampère's have reciprocal changes.

Wait, no, let me think. If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B is non-zero. That's equation 2. But what about equation 3, Faraday's Law? Faraday's Law involves the curl of E. In the presence of magnetic current, maybe the equation changes. Hmm, in our world, Faraday's Law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But with magnetic monopoles, perhaps we have an additional term. Or maybe the equation for the curl of E would include a term related to the magnetic current density.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. In the standard equations, the time derivative of B is linked to the curl of E. If there's a magnetic current, would that affect Faraday's Law? Because in Ampère's Law, we added a displacement current to account for changing E
