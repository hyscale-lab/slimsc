Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let me try to work through this step by step. 

The problem says that compound X (with the formula C11H12O) is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and we need to find out what Compound X is from the options provided.

Hmm, wait. Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the ring-opening of epoxides. It's a bicyclic amine that acts as a strong base and can perform a ring-opening via an SN2 mechanism, especially under heat. So if the product is formed after this reaction, maybe the original compound X is an epoxide. Because reacting an epoxide with a strong base like this would typically open the epoxide.

So the product here isn't the epoxide anymore but the product after the ring-opening. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the product's NMR is given. So let's think. If X is an epoxide, like an oxirane, and it's treated with a base, it would open to form a diol. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide that undergoes some kind of rearrangement? Wait, no, wait. The reaction conditions are nonpolar solvent and high temperature. Diazabicyclo is a strong enough base to deprotonate, causing the ring-opening.

Wait, but the question is asking about the structure of compound X, which is the starting material. The product's NMR gives us clues about what X was. So perhaps I should look at the product's structure first.

Looking at the NMR data of the product:

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like maybe an aromatic ring or an electronegative atom.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): another singlet methyl, possibly similar to the first.
- Then there are aromatic protons: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

The 13C NMR shows:
- Two carbons at δ21.3 and 28.4, both singlets. Those are likely to be CH3 groups attached to something.
- The rest are around 125-144, which are typical for aromatic carbons, and one at 197.7, which is a carbonyl, maybe a ketone? Or perhaps an ester, but considering the reaction, maybe it's a carbonyl from an acid or something else. Wait, but we have an oxygen in the formula, so perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, but the product, after the ring-opening, would have an alcohol group if it's a diol. But looking at the NMR, I don't see any broad or OH signals, so maybe the product is something else. Or perhaps the diol has been further processed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should reconstruct the product structure. Let's think about what an epoxide would look like before reaction. Epoxides are three-membered rings with two adjacent carbons each bonded to an oxygen. When they react with a strong base like 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, the epoxide ring opens to form an alcohol. Wait, but the product here might have a carbonyl group, given the 13C at 197.7. Hmm, a carbonyl would suggest maybe a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but
