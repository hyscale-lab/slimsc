Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The problem says the electron's speed is 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle equation for position and momentum is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, which is mass times uncertainty in velocity, Δv. But wait, I'm not sure if Δp is just mΔv or if I should use the velocity uncertainty. Hmm, maybe I should proceed step by step.

First, the given data: v is 2e8 m/s. But wait, is that the average speed or the uncertainty in velocity? Oh, I think the problem gives us the speed, but the uncertainty in position, and asks for the uncertainty in energy. Hmm, maybe I don't need the speed value directly, but perhaps I should find the momentum uncertainty using the position uncertainty and then relate that to energy.

Wait, but how does the uncertainty in momentum relate to the uncertainty in energy? Oh, right, the kinetic energy is p²/(2m). So perhaps I can find Δp from the position uncertainty, and then compute the uncertainty in energy from that.

Wait, let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). But wait, actually, since the problem says "estimate the minimum uncertainty", perhaps I can take Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Because the minimum uncertainty is when equality holds, so Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

So first, let's compute Δp. The Planck constant ħ
