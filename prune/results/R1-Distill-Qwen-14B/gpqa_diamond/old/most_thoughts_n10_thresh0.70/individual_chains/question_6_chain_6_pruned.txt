Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) which is given as (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. And I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy depends on the potential and the kinetic energy. The particle is in two dimensions, so I'm probably dealing with polar coordinates here. The potential looks like it's a function of r and θ, so maybe I can separate the problem into radial and angular parts.

Let me think about the potential term. V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. That can be rewritten as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, that's (1/2)kr² multiplied by (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm. So the potential has a radial part and a θ-dependent part. That suggests that this is a central potential plus an angular-dependent perturbation or something like that.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. The potential is actually separable into r and θ parts. Because each term is a product of r² and a function of θ. So perhaps the Hamiltonian can be written in a way that separates the variables.

In two dimensions, the Hamiltonian for a particle is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ). In polar coordinates, p² is the Laplacian in 2D, which is (-ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) d/dr (r dψ/dr) ) + (1/(r²)) d²ψ/dθ² ].

So the Hamiltonian becomes H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ) = [ (-ħ²/(2m r²)) (d/dr)(r dψ/dr) ) - (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²ψ/dθ²) ) ] + (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Wait, but perhaps I can factor the potential. Let's see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr
