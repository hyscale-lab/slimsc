Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main focus is on the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. Also, the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. The photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use some standard equations from that.

Hmm. So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, and E2 > E1. So, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)).

Wait, but when the star's effective temperature changes, this ratio changes. So, the ratio is a function of temperature. The problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, and the ratio decreases. So, when Teff is lower, the ratio gets smaller.

Wait, but wait. The ratio is n2/n1. If when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), this ratio decreases compared to when it's spotless (Teff=6000 K). So, the question is asking for the factor (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

But wait, the ratio is being observed to decrease when spots are present. So when the spots are present, the photosphere is
