Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about two different reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B from each. Then, I have to select the correct option from the given choices.

First, let's break down each reaction.

Reaction 1: 
Starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. The reagents used are BuLi followed by H+.

I remember that BuLi is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. The starting material is a benzyl ether with a substituent. Let me draw the structure mentally: the benzene ring has a CH2-O group attached. The oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So, the structure is CH2-O-(CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl), which would be CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. So the structure is benzyl-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2.

Hmm, when BuLi is added, it's a strong base, so it's likely to abstract a proton. Where would that happen? The molecule has an allyl group attached to the ether oxygen. The structure is OCH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. So there's a conjugated diene here, but wait, actually, it's a vinyl group attached to another group. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 of the butene.

Wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl). So numbering from the end attached to O: position 1 is OCH2-, position 2 is double bond starting, so structure is OCH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-(CH3)? No, let's number correctly. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2
