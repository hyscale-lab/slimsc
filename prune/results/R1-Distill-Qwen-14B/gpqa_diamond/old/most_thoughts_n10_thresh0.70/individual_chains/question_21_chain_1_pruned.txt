Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me tackle each part separately.

Part A: Determine which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

First, I need to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair (like in keto-enol tautomerism), resulting in different structural isomers. For example, in carbonyl compounds, enol and keto forms are tautomers.

Benzoquinone is a compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic diketone, right? It has two oxygen atoms in a six-membered ring. So, it's similar to cyclohexane-1,2-dione but in a benzene ring structure. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Oh wait, no, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in a conjugated structure. Alternatively, I think benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups opposite each other, like in para positions.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring. So, positions 1,3,5 all have ketone groups. That's three carbonyl groups. 

Now, tautomerism usually occurs when there are adjacent groups that can deprotonate and form a conjugated system. For example, cyclohexane-1,3-dione can tautomerize because the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, allowing for keto-enol shifts. But if the carbonyl groups are too far apart, maybe tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, but benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Are they para to each other? Let me think.
