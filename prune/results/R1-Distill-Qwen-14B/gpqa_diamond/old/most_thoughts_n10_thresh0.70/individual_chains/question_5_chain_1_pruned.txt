Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on eigenvectors, especially in this context, but I'll give it a shot.

So the problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm. Wait, the operator P is probably the spin operator, since we're dealing with a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So P would represent the spin angular momentum, right?

The question gives the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down each component:

- Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

I remember that the total operator P in an arbitrary direction n can be written as a combination of these components. Oh right, if n is in the x-z plane, it has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. In spherical coordinates, the direction vector is usually expressed as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since we're in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π/2? Wait, wait. Wait, the x-z plane. So the angle φ is zero because the direction is along the x-z plane, so the angle around the y-axis is zero. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So then, the operator P along n would be:

P_n = (n · (Px, Py, Pz)) 

Wait, no, the operator P along direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So more precisely,

P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z )

Where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. Since in this case, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

But wait, the given components Px, Py, Pz are each (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices. So:

Px = (ħ/2) σ_x
Py = (ħ/2) σ_y
Pz = (ħ/2) σ_z

So the operator P along direction n is (n_x Px + n_z Pz + n_y Py) / (n_x^2 + n_z^2 + n_y^2 )^{1/2} } ?

Wait no, wait. Wait, no,
