Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given a certain interaction Lagrangian and its mass. The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to figure out which of the options A to D is correct.

First, let's look at the Lagrangian given. The interaction term is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misreading that. Oh, the original is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh right, that's a typo on my part. So the interaction term is Yukawa-like. The Yukawa interaction is usually something like λ \bar{ψ} φ ψ, where φ is a scalar field. Here, X is the scalar field, and v is a constant (maybe the vacuum expectation value?), and ψ_f is a fermion field.

So the interaction term suggests that the boson X couples to fermions. The type of fermion it couples to depends on ψ_f. So ψ_f could be any fermion, but the mass terms would come into play when considering decays.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it has to produce particles whose combined rest mass is less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

Now, the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, we're looking for decay channels where X can split into two particles, each of which is a fermion-antifermion pair? Or wait, no. Wait, the interaction is between X and fermions, so the decay would be X → f f-bar? Because the interaction term couples X to two fermions. So X can decay into a fermion and its antiparticle.

But wait, in the Lagrangian, the term is (v + X) acting on ψ_f. So the interaction is proportional to X, which means that when X is created or annihilated, it's via this interaction term. So, the Feynman diagram for X decaying would be X producing a fermion and antifermion pair.

Wait no, no, X is a boson, so when it decays, it would produce two fermions, right? Because the interaction is between X and two fermions. Wait, no, the term is (v + X) acting on ψ_f. So the interaction is between X and a pair of fermions. So for X to decay, it must create a fermion and antifermion pair. But wait, no, wait. The interaction is between X and a single fermion? Wait no, the term is \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. So each ψ_f is a Dirac spinor, meaning that each term is a fermion field. So the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f. So X couples to two fermions of the same type, but opposite spins.

Wait, no, the term is scalar. So \bar{ψ}_f is a Dirac spinor, and ψ_f is another, but together they form a scalar when
