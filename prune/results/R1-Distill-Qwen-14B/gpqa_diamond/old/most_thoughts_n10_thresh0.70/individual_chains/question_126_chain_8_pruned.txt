Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see... The question involves two reactions, and then analyzing the products using HPLC. Hmm, I remember that HPLC can separate compounds based on their interaction with the stationary phase. There's normal-phase and chiral-phase columns, so I'll need to figure out how the products behave in each.

First, let me look at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone. Structure-wise, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. So the structure is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. When I reduce that ketone (the C=O at position 3), it will become a secondary alcohol, so OH at position 3. So the product after Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait—the starting material is (S) configuration. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the starting ketone's structure. Since the ketone is in a chiral center (because the carbon has four different groups: two CH2 groups, an OMe, and the OH after reduction?), wait, no. Let me think again. The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is:

CH2CH2 at 1 and 2, then the ketone at 3 (so it's (CH2)2CO... Wait no, wait, the structure is more like:

The main chain is 6 carbons with a ketone at position 3. So positions 1, 2, 3 are CH2-CH2-CO-... Then positions 4,5,6: so position 4 is CH2, position 5 is OCH3, and position 6 is CH3. Wait, maybe I should write it as:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the structure is: 

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO then four more carbons. Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH2CH3. But substituting the 5th carbon with OMe: so the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? So the 5th carbon is CH(OCH3). So when we reduce the ketone at position 3, the product becomes a secondary alcohol at position 3.

So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But since the starting material was chiral (S configuration), the product will have a new chiral center at C3. But wait, the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol—does that create a new chiral center? Because the ketone (sp² hybridized) is planar, so the addition of H from LAH can be from either face. Wait, but the starting material was a single enantiomer. So the configuration of the new chiral center will depend on the starting configuration.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the 5-methoxy group is on a chiral center at position 5. Wait, no, position 5 is where the OMe is attached. Let me think: the molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is CH2CH2-CO-O... No, wait, wait, the structure is:
