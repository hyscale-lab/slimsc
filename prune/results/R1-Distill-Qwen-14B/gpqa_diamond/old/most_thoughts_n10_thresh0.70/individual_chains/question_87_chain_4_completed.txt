Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so I need to figure out what the structure looks like and then match it to one of the NMR options.

First, let me think about the structure. A di-substituted benzene ring would have two substituents. The ring itself is a 6-membered aromatic ring. So if it's di-substituted, that's two groups attached to the benzene.

The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the two substituents add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, but wait. Wait, no—the substituents can have multiple carbons. Let me see: di-substituted benzene has two groups attached. So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + substituent carbons. So substituent carbons must add up to 2, because 6 + 2 = 8. So each substituent must be a single carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, wait, benzene can't have substituents with zero carbons because substituents are groups attached, like -Cl or -CH3, which do have carbons if they're alkyl groups.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, or something with a carbonyl). Since the FTIR shows a carbonyl peak, that's a strong indication. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, etc.

So, if the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen, perhaps. Let me think: benzene with two substituents, one being a halogen (like Cl) and the other a carbonyl-containing group, like an acetyl group (COCH3), or maybe a ketone, or maybe an ester, or perhaps an aldehyde. Wait, but the NMR will help me figure that out.

Wait, but the substituents can't be just one carbon each. Let me think about the carbons. The total is 8. So 6 in benzene, and 2 from substituents. So if one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), that doesn't add any carbons because Cl is a substituent with no C. So the other substituent must have 2 carbons. Because 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 2 (other substituent) =8 carbons.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me recalculate: 6 (benzene) + substituent carbons. So substituent carbons must sum to 2. So if one substituent is Cl (0 carbons), the other substituent must have 2 carbons.

So what are possible substituents with 2 carbons? Maybe a -CH2- group attached to something. Alternatively, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like -CO- something. Let's think.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a halogen (like Cl) and an acetyl group (COCH3). Wait, acetyl is COCH3, which has 2 carbons (the C in CO and the CH3). Wait, no, the COCH3 would add 2 carbons (the CO is one C, the CH3 is another C), so together, substituent carbons would be 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 2. So that adds up to 6 + 0 + 2 = 8 carbons total. That works.

So the structure would be benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. Now, how are they substituted? The question says di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring.

But wait, the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so that's the Cl attached directly to the benzene. The carbonyl group would be from the COCH3 part, which would be an acetyl group. So the structure is something like para-chloroacetophenone, perhaps. Or maybe meta or ortho. Let me think about the substituents' positions.

Wait, but how does the substitution pattern affect the NMR? The NMR will show signals for the aromatic protons, the acetyl (COCH3) protons, and any other protons from substituents.

Wait, in the acetyl group (COCH3), the CH3 is attached to the carbonyl. The protons on the CH3 would be a singlet, probably around 2.1 ppm or so. But looking at the options, let's check.

Looking at option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm, the 9.9 ppm is a high value, maybe an aldehyde proton. But wait, if the substituent is COCH3, then there's no aldehyde. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group, but perhaps in a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent isn't an acetyl group. Let me think again. Another possibility is that the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another substituent, perhaps a methylene group. Wait, but let's think about the total carbons again.

Wait, another approach: let's think about each option and see which one fits.

Option A:
9.9 (1H, s) → Maybe an aldehyde proton, but it's a singlet. So perhaps an aldehyde group attached. But then the substituents would be aldehyde and Cl? Let's see. If the compound is benzaldehyde with a Cl substituent, but then that would be two substituents. But wait, benzaldehyde is a mono-substituted. Wait, in this case, it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So if substituents are Cl and CHO, then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 1 (CHO) = 7 carbons. But the question says 8 carbons. So that's not matching.

So option A's 9.9 is a singlet, maybe an aldehyde. But that would make the total carbons 7, not 8. So probably not option A.

Option B:
4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). Hmm, these are more like CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to oxygen, like ethers or esters. The 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, maybe a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like an oxygen. But where is the carbonyl group in this structure? I'm not sure. Let's think about the structure. Maybe it's something like a diethyl group, but that may not fit the carbonyl.

Wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so this option might not fit because it doesn't show any signals that would correspond to a carbonyl group, like a CH3 attached to a carbonyl (like in option C, for example). So maybe option B is not correct.

Option C:
7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet, which could be a CH3 attached to a carbonyl. So for example, the COCH3 group. The aromatic protons: 7.8 and 7.6 as doublets. That suggests a para-substituted pattern. Because in para substitution, you'll have two sets of doublets, each integrating for 2H. So, for example, if the benzene has substituents at para positions, then the aromatic protons would split into two doublets.

So the substituents would be Cl and COCH3. Wait, but the positions would need to be such that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. If Cl is at position 1, and COCH3 is at position 3, that's meta. Or if they are para, then substituents are at 1 and 4. Wait, but if the substituents are both at para positions, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern.

Wait, also, the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so the Cl is attached to the ring. So perhaps the structure is para-chloroacetophenone. That would have substituents at the para positions: Cl and COCH3.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. Let me think: the acetophenone part is a COCH3 attached to benzene. The Cl is at the para position relative to the COCH3.

So the aromatic ring would have two substituents: COCH3 and Cl, in para positions.

In such a structure, the aromatic protons would be the two ortho to COCH3 (which are deshielded and perhaps downfield) and the two meta to Cl. Wait, but in a para-substituted di-substituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other. So the ring would have four equivalent protons in two sets of doublets.

Wait, no, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, all the protons are equivalent, but wait, that's not the case here since we have two different substituents.

Wait, no, if substituents are different, then the ring would have four protons, perhaps in two doublets. Let me think: if the substituents are at 1 and 3 positions, that's meta, but then the protons would be in a different pattern. Alternatively, if they are para, positions 1 and 4, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, maybe I should think about the coupling in the aromatic region. For a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the protons adjacent to each substituent would be in a certain pattern. Let's see: each substituent would have two ortho protons, but if the substituents are para, the two ortho protons to COCH3 would be equivalent, and the two ortho protons to Cl would also be equivalent, but maybe they are deshielded or shielded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to two sets of doublets. So in the NMR, the aromatic region would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches option C, which has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that would suggest two sets of two equivalent protons each.

The 2.3 ppm singlet would be the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. So that would fit the COCH3 substituent. And the Cl substituent would be in the para position relative to the COCH3.

So option C's NMR seems to fit that scenario. Let's check the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). Hmm, the 6.9 singlet is a single aromatic proton, which would suggest a substituent that's perhaps ortho, leading to a single proton. Wait, but that would require a substituent that's in a position that causes only one proton to be adjacent. Maybe a substituent like a methyl group attached in a way that the ring has a single proton, but that's more common in mono-substituted rings, not di-substituted. Or perhaps it's a substituent where the ring has symmetry leading to one set of protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that causes the ring to have a single H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps the substituent has a carbonyl group. The 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are doublets. Those could be from CH2 groups attached to oxygen, like in an ester or ether. The 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Maybe a methylene group. Hmm, but I'm not immediately seeing how that would fit with the substituents. Let me think about that.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group, like OCOCH2CH3 or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group. For example, a ketone with a CH2 group attached elsewhere.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the substituents. The two substituents are Cl and COCH3. The structure is para-substituted, so the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. And the CH3 would be a singlet at around 2.3 ppm, which is option C. So that seems to fit.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. For example, if the substituent isn't an acetyl group but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent with the carbonyl could be a ketone, but perhaps the substituent is a methyl ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group attached to a CH2Cl. But that would complicate the structure.

Wait, but wait, the initial problem says the compound has 8 carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons. Then the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So one substituent is Cl (0 carbons), the other substituent must be a group with 2 carbons. So perhaps a COCH2 group? No, that would require more carbons. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps the substituent isn't COCH3 but something else. Let me think: another group with 2 carbons could be a CH2Cl. But that would be a substituent with 2 carbons, but then where is the carbonyl group? Oh wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of another substituent. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with a CH2 group attached, like CH2CO- something. No, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring, but that would require the substituent to be, say, a ketone, which would be CO attached to a CH2 group. But in that case, perhaps the substituent is CH2CO, but that doesn't make sense without another group attached.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine the NMR options. Let's look at option C again.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So the 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which is likely a CH3 attached to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. So that would be the COCH3 group.

The aromatic protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted structure. So the substituents are para to each other.

So in the structure, the ring has Cl and COCH3 in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be the two ortho to Cl and two meta to COCH3, or vice versa. Wait, no, in a para-substituted di-substituted benzene with two different groups, the ortho and para positions would have different shifts.

Wait, perhaps in para-chloroacetophenone, the two substituents are para, so the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. The protons adjacent to the COCH3 would be more deshielded (downfield) than those adjacent to the Cl.

So in the NMR, the two protons ortho to COCH3 would be a doublet at higher ppm (like 7.8), and the two protons para to Cl would be a doublet at lower ppm (like 7.6), but I'm not entirely certain about the exact chemical shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl causes more deshielding, so the protons next to Cl would be more downfield.

Wait, but in reality, the substituent with the higher electron-withdrawing effect would cause the adjacent protons to be more downfield. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group (by induction) and COCH3 is also electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl). So the protons next to COCH3 would be more deshielded than those next to Cl, perhaps.

So in the NMR, the two protons adjacent to COCH3 would be at higher ppm (like 7.8), and the two protons adjacent to Cl would be at lower ppm (like 7.6). So that would match option C.

So in option C, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each of 2H, and the CH3 is a singlet at 2.3. That seems to fit the scenario.

Wait, let me think about option D. It has a 6.9 ppm singlet for 1H. That's a single aromatic proton, which is unusual for a di-substituted benzene unless the substituents are in a specific configuration that leaves only one equivalent proton. For example, if the substituents are in such a way that a single proton remains, but I think that's more common in mono-substituted rings. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that one proton is isolated. But I'm not sure. Also, option D includes 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are probably from CH2 groups next to oxygen, maybe in an ester or ether group. But then where's the carbonyl? Because the IR says there's a carbonyl. So that would require another substituent with a carbonyl, but I don't see that in the NMR.

So, going back, option C seems to fit the scenario where the substituents are Cl and COCH3 in para positions, leading to the NMR signals as described. The CH3 group attached to the carbonyl would appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm, and the aromatic protons would split into two doublets, each 2H, at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The question involves identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents: one being a halogen (e.g., Cl) and the other a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH3). The total number of carbons is 8, so the benzene ring (6 carbons) plus the substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. This implies the substituents are Cl (0 carbons) and COCH3 (2 carbons).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks at 9.9 ppm (1H, s) suggest an aldehyde proton, but this would not fit the structure since the substituents are Cl and COCH3, not CHO.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the total carbon count (8 carbons) and the substituents described.  

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), and 1.3 ppm (3H, s) suggest CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen, possibly in an ether or ester.  
   - However, there is no clear evidence of a carbonyl group in the aromatic region, which contradicts the IR data.  

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.  
   - The peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) corresponds to a CH3 group attached to a carbonyl, fitting the COCH3 substituent.  
   - This option aligns with the structure of para-chloroacetophenone, where Cl and COCH3 are in para positions.  

4. **Option D**:  
   - A peak at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests a single aromatic proton, which is unusual for a di-substituted benzene unless the substituents create an asymmetric environment.  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), and 1.3 ppm (2H, s) suggest CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen, but there is no clear evidence of a carbonyl group in the aromatic region.  

### Conclusion:
Option C is the only choice that matches the expected structure of para-chloroacetophenone, with a para-substituted benzene ring having Cl and COCH3 as substituents. The NMR data (aromatic protons as two doublets and a singlet for the CH3 group) aligns with this structure and the IR data indicating the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.
