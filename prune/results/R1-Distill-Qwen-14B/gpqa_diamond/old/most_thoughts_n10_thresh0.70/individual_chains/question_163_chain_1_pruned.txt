Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find out the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Right, Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. Since it's a hydroxide, it should react with an acid. Monobasic strong acid probably means an acid like HCl, HNO3, etc., which are strong and donate one H+ per molecule.

So the reaction would be Fe(OH)3 reacting with a strong acid. Let me write that down.

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O

Right, that's the neutralization reaction. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions (from the acid).

First, I need to find how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol, approximately 9.358e-4 mol.

Now, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+. So H+ needed = 3 * 9.358e-4 = approx 0.0028074 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter (1000 cm³). So to find the volume, we can use moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

So Volume = moles / Molarity = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L, which is 28.074 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's probably the volume part.

Wait, but the question says "minimum volume". So that makes sense, because we're adding just enough H+ to completely dissolve the Fe(OH)3.

Now, what about the pH of the resulting solution? After the reaction, we'll have Fe³+ ions in solution, and any excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but wait: after the reaction, we'll have the solution containing Fe³+ and any other ions. Also, since the acid is strong, it will fully dissociate. So the H+ comes from the acid and any from water (but negligible compared to excess H+).

So first, let's calculate the total volume after adding the acid. The initial volume is 100 cm³; the acid added is 28.074 cm³. So total volume is 100 + 28.074 = 128.074 cm³, which is 0.128074 liters.

Now, the moles of H+ added are 0.0028074 mol, which is exactly the amount needed to react with Fe(OH)3. So wait, does that mean all H+ is consumed? No, wait. Because Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 grams, which is 0.0009358 mol, requiring 0.0028074 mol of H+. So if the acid is 0.1 M, then adding 28.074 cm³ gives 0.0028074 mol H+. So all the H+ is used up in the reaction.

Wait, but wait. Because the acid is monobasic, each mole gives one H+. So yes, that's correct.

But then, after the reaction, the solution is of Fe³+ ions. Fe(OH)3 is sparingly soluble, but in this case, we're adding enough acid to dissolve it. So the solution will have Fe³+ ions and water. Wait, but wait another thing: when Fe(OH)3 dissolves in acid, it's Fe³+ and water. But will the solution be neutral? No, because the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O.

So after the reaction, the solution will have Fe³+ ions and whatever H+ is left. But in this case, the H+ added is exactly 3 moles per mole of Fe(OH)3, so if all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, then there's no excess H+ left. Wait, that can't be right because we're adding exactly the required H+ to neutralize the hydroxide.

So in the resulting solution, the only H+ comes from water and the Fe³+ hydrolysis. Because the acid is strong, but in this case, all H+ from the acid is used in the reaction.

Wait, but
