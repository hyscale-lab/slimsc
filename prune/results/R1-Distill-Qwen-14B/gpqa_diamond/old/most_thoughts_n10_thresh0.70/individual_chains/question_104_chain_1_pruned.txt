Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. The planets have circular orbits, so that part is straightforward.

The key detail is the periodic shift in the spectral lines observed. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines corresponds to the velocity of the star moving towards or away from us. So the formula I think I need is the one that relates the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P) of the planet.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^2 ) / (M_star * (1 + M_p/M_star)) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e^2))^(1/2)

But wait, since the planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars are like the Sun, M_p is much less than M_star. So M_p/M_star is negligible compared to 1. So the denominator (1 + M_p/M_star) can be approximated as 1. So the formula simplifies a bit, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach this.

Alternatively, I remember that for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K (the velocity of the star) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) )^(1/ (3*1)) * (P )^(-1/3)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the relationship between the velocity semi
