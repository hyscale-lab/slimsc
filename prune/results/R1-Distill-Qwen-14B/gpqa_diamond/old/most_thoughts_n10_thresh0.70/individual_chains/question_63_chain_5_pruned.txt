Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

So the options are A to D, each with different values. The given data includes masses of X and Y, bond length, and angular frequency. Let's jot down what I remember.

Wait, the molecule is a diatomic, so it's like X-Y, right? The rotation-vibration model probably means it's considering both rotational and vibrational energies. But wait, the problem says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right, but the fundamental state is the state with the lowest energy in both rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is when both rotation and vibration are in their lowest energy states.

Now, the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the next lowest state. The next stateâ€”what's that? I think the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in the rotational-vibrational model, transitions can involve changes in both rotational and vibrational states. But perhaps in this case, since it's the fundamental state, the next state might be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, no, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That suggests that it's considering the next
