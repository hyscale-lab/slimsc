Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) which is given by (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Hmm, right. So, the potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² plus (3/2 k r² cos²θ). I should probably express this in terms that make it easier to analyze, maybe in polar coordinates because the problem is given in r and θ.

Wait, wait. Let's break down the potential. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential, because the standard harmonic oscillator in 2D is (1/2) m ω² r², but wait, no, wait. Actually, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2) m ω² r², but in this case, the potential has k r². Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of angular frequency. Because the standard harmonic oscillator in 2D would give a potential energy of (1/2) m ω² r², so perhaps k is m ω², but I'm not sure. Let me put that aside for a moment.

The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that: (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4, so it's (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So V(r,θ) becomes:

V = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, that's because the (3/2)k r² cos²θ becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So adding the terms together.

Wait, wait:
