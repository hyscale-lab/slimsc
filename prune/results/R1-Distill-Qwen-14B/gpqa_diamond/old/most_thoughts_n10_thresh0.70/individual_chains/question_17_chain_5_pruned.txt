Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, EDTA is that chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about protonation or anything. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Wait, I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf is given as 5e10, which is pretty large, so the complex is very stable.

The problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So, if the complex is formed, the concentration of free Ca²+ will be really low because most of the Ca is tied up in the complex.

Wait, but let me think about stoichiometry. The complex is stoichiometric, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would each be 0.02 M, assuming they form a 1:1 complex. But wait, no, because when the complex forms, it's a 1:1 ratio, so for every mole
