Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic mixture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene being treated with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So the catalyst helps in the redistribution of the alkylidene groups.

Wait, the molecule in question is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH₂? Wait no, maybe I should get the structure right. Oh wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Pent has five carbons. So 1-ene is double bond between C1 and C2. 3-methyl means a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, maybe I messed up the chain.

Wait, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, that's longer. Wait, let me count. For pent-1-ene, the five carbons are arranged as CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be six carbons. Wait, wait, no. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene: the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that would be five carbons in the main chain? Wait, no. Let me count: the main chain is five carbons. Structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? That would be five carbons in the main chain, but the substituents... Wait, no, maybe it's (CH₂)₂CH-CH2-CH2, but wait, maybe I should think
