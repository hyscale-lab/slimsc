Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned in either the up or down state along a particular axis, like the z-axis in this case. The problem says the magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, right? So mu = γ S_z.

The setup is that initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the magnetic field switches from z to y, same strength.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh, so I guess the spin was aligned along z, then the field changes to y, and the spin precesses around y, causing the z-component to oscillate.

Wait, when the magnetic field is applied along a different axis, the spin will precess around that axis. The precession leads to oscillations in the spin components in the original frame, which was along z.

I remember that when the magnetic field is along the z-axis, the energy levels are quantized, and the spin is stationary. But when the field is suddenly changed, the spin starts to precess around the new field direction.

So, the precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is ω = γ B. But wait, what's the relationship between the precession and the oscillation of the z-component?

Let me think. The spin is now precessing around the Y-axis. The z-component of the spin will oscillate sinusoidally with a certain frequency. The oscillation in the expectation value of S_z (or mu_z) will depend on the angle of precession.

In the frame of reference where the magnetic field is along Y, the spin's expectation values in X, Y, and Z will change over time. The precession causes the spin to rotate around the Y-axis, so the Z-component will vary sinusoidally.

The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy splitting induced by the magnetic field and the system's response. The energy difference between the spin-up and spin-down states in the Y-direction gives the oscillation frequency.

Wait, the Larmor frequency is ω = γ B. Because for a spin in a magnetic field, the frequency is proportional to the field strength. So the precession frequency is γ B.

But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component. Let me model this.

Let's model the spin state. Initially, the spin is along
