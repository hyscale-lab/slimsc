Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The particle is initially aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the time evolution of the system. So initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z, so the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz. Then, the field is changed to Y, so the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Let me think about the initial state. Since the magnetic field is along +Z and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned, that must mean it's in the eigenstate of Sz. So the initial state is |+z⟩, right? Because mu is along B, so it's aligned, so the spin is up along Z.

When the magnetic field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -μ·B'. Oh wait, more accurately, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -γ B · S, but wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So the Hamiltonian for a magnetic field B in a particular direction would be H = -mu · B. Because the potential energy is U = -mu · B.

So initially, when the B is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu * B_z, which with mu = gamma S_z, becomes H_initial = -gamma B S_z. But wait, in the initial state, the particle is in the eigenstate of S_z, so the state is |+z⟩, and the energy is E_initial = -gamma B (ħ/2) because S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩. Wait, but actually, for spin 1/2, S_z has eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So E_initial = - mu * B_z, but mu is gamma S_z. So substituting, it's H_initial = - gamma B S_z. So the energies are -gamma B (ħ/2) and +gamma B (ħ/2), I guess.

But then the magnetic field is turned off and another
