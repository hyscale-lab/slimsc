Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it through carefully. Hmm, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Alright, I need to figure out what's going on here.

First, let me break down the information. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, two substituents are attached to the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, a benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. So each substituent is probably a single carbon group, or maybe one is a single carbon and another is a group with more carbons, but maybe they share a carbon or something. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the substituents could be a carbonyl group and a halogen. Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and a halogen (like Cl or Br) attached to the ring. Wait, but the aromatic-halogen bond would mean that one substituent is a halide, like Cl or Br.

So, substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe), and the other is a halogen. Or, wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an acyl group. Let me think.

But wait, the ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's imagine positions. If it's a 6-membered ring, di-substituted, the substituents could be in the para, meta, or ortho positions. But the structure of the substituents would affect the NMR.

Wait, the carbonyl group in the IR could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So let's think about possible structures.

Another approach: the molecular formula. The aromatic ring has 6 carbons, substituents add 2, so total 8. So, possible substituents: a halogen (like Cl, which is one atom but contributes 0 carbons) and a carbonyl group. Wait, but a carbonyl group (like a ketone) would be a single carbon attached
