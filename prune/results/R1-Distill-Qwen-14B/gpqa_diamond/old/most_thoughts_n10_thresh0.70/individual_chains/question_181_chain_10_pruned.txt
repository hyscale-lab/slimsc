Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps in the proton-proton chain. Oh right, the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. The pp-III branch is when two protons fuse into a helium-3 nucleus, and then two of those combine into helium-4. But wait, I think the majority of the Sun's energy actually comes from the pp-I branch, which involves the other proton fusions. 

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I think that's the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth, so any neutrinos produced would have been emitted before that time. So, the neutrinos we're detecting now would only come from the reactions that haven't been affected yet. Since the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from that process won't be reaching us anymore, but the other reactions are still going on.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in various processes. The main ones are the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. Oh, right, in the pp chain, the dominant neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the beta decay steps. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos too, I think. So if pp-III stops, that part of the neutrino flux should drop.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how much the flux in each band changes when the pp-III branch stops.

I remember that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with higher energies compared to the pp-I. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III might produce higher. Because the pp-III involves more mass in the initial steps, maybe higher binding energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with other processes.

Wait, in the pp-I branch, each step involves lower masses, so the neutrinos might have lower energies. The pp-III branch, which combines two helium-3 nuclei to form helium-4, has higher mass, so the emitted neutrinos might have higher energy. Or is it the other way around? Let me think about the energies involved. The pp-III branch produces a helium-4 from two helium-3, which each have a mass of about 2 protons. So when they combine, maybe the binding energy is higher, but the neutrinos come from the beta decay steps. Hmm, perhaps the neutrino energies are similar regardless.

Alternatively, maybe the dominant neutrinos for the pp-III branch are from the beta decay of boron-8, which is a part of the pp-III process. Boron-8 has a higher mass, so the neutrinos from its decay would have higher energy. Wait, but I thought boron-8 is actually part of the CNO cycle? Or is it part of the proton-proton chain? Oh, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I think in the pp chain, the main neutrinos are from the beta decays of the intermediates. For the pp-I branch, it's the decay of deuterium into tritium, or something like that. For the pp-III, I think the neutrinos come from the decay of helium-3 into helium-4, but that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos in pp-III come from a different step.

Alternatively, perhaps the main neutrino emission from the pp-III branch is the production of boron-8, which then decays into lithium-7 and emits a neutrino. Wait, no, boron-8 decays into lithium-7 and a positron, releasing a neutrino. But I think that's part of the pp-III branch. So the neutrinos from boron-8 decay are higher energy than those from the other branches, as boron-8 is heavier.

Wait, but the neutrino energy from boron-8 decay is about 15.5 MeV, which is much higher than the bands in the question (700-900 keV). Hmm, so maybe the neutrinos in the bands we're looking at (700-800, 800-900 keV) are from other sources. Maybe the majority of the solar neutrinos are from the CNO cycle, not the pp chain. Or perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, which part of the neutrino flux is affected? So the pp-III produces some neutrinos, but I'm not sure which part of the spectrum they contribute to
