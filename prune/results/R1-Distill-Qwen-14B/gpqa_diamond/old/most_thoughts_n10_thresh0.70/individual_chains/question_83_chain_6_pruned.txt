Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms the acetate ion. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. 

First, I think I need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution can be found using M1V1 = M2V2. 

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted solution is 0.0125 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating, the volume of NaOH added will be 25% of the equivalence point volume. Wait, no, 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find out how much moles of acetic acid are present initially, then how much NaOH is added at 25% titration.

The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.0125 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.0005 moles.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.0005 = 0.000125 moles of NaOH are added. Wait, no, wait. Because in the titration, the moles of NaOH added will neutralize moles of acetic acid. So for each mole of acetic acid, one mole of NaOH is needed. So at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized.

So moles of acetic acid neutralized: 0.0005 * 0.25 = 0.000125 mol. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 mol. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.000125 mol.

But wait, the total volume is important too. Because when we add the NaOH, the total volume increases. But I'm not sure if they're asking about the solution after adding 25% of the required NaOH, so the volume would be the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added.

Wait, no, perhaps I should find the equivalence point first. Because the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.0005 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence: moles / concentration = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5 cm³.

So 25% titration would be 1.25
