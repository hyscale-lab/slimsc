Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Alright, the question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these. I need to figure out which symmetries must be obeyed by all SMEFT operators.

First, what's SMEFT about? From what I remember, SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model (SM) by including all possible higher-dimensional operators, respecting the SM gauge symmetry. But what about other symmetries?

Let me consider each symmetry one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant. SMEFT includes all possible operators that are Lorentz-invariant, right? So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely a must.

2. Poincaré Symmetry: Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). Since the SM respects Poincaré, I think SMEFT would too. Because if you have a theory that's Lorentz-invariant, it's also Poincaré-invariant if it's a relativistic theory, which SMEFT is. So 2 must be respected as well.

Wait, but wait: sometimes people separate Lorentz and Poincaré. Since Poincaré includes translations, but SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, which would include Poincaré symmetry. So I think both 1 and 2 are correct.

3. CP Symmetry: CP is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. I know that the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in some cases, like in the CKM matrix. So, can SMEFT operators violate CP? Well, the SM doesn't enforce CP symmetry, so the effective theory shouldn't either. So operators in SMEFT can have CP violation. So 3 is not a must—so operators don't have to respect CP.

4. CPT Symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry. And SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, should also respect CPT. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is a must.

So putting it together, which symmetries are mandatory? Lorentz (1 yes), Poincaré (2 yes), CPT (4 yes). So the correct options must include 1, 2, and 4. But wait, the options don't have all three. Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the right choice.

Wait, but wait a moment. Does SMEFT respect Poincaré symmetry? Because Poincaré includes translations, which are related to momentum conservation. In SMEFT, the operators are classified by their dimension, and they're built from the SM fields. But do all SMEFT operators have to be Poincaré invariant? Because if the original SM is Poincaré, then any higher-dimension operator built from SM fields would also respect Poincaré, as they're constructed to be Lorentz-invariant and the terms are local. So yes, Poincaré symmetry holds. So 1 and 2 are both required.

So the correct answer combines 1, 2, and 4. That's option C. So the answer should be C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT framework is constructed to include all possible higher-dimensional operators that are Lorentz-invariant. Since Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental requirement for relativistic theories, all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry along with translational symmetry (e.g., momentum conservation). Since SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry as it is built from the Standard Model, which already satisfies this symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not necessarily respect CP symmetry, as seen in phenomena like the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to preserve CP symmetry, as CP violation is allowed in the framework.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, being an effective theory of the Standard Model, must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must preserve CPT symmetry.

Based on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all SMEFT operators are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**

Answer: C
