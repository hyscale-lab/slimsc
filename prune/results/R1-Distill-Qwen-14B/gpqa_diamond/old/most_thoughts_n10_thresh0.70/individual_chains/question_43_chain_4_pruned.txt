Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of this. But let's take it step by step.

The question describes a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me try to parse all the information given.

First, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (that's an aldehyde group, right?), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, that means each of these groups is separated by one carbon. Like, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the aldehyde would be at 3, and the cyano at 5, or something like that. Wait, no, meta means two positions apart. So positions 1, 3, and 5 would be meta to each other.

Wait, let me get the numbering right. In benzoic acid, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, so it gets the lowest possible number, which is position 1. So, the substituents meta to each other would be positions 3 and 5.

Wait, no. The question says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each is meta relative to the others. So it's like, each is two positions apart from the others. Hmm.

Let me try to imagine the benzene ring. Let's fix the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, the next substituent – say, the aldehyde – would be in position 3. The cyano group would have to be in position 5, because that's two positions away from position 3 (3+2=5), but wait, from position 1, position 5 is two positions away as well (1-2 is
