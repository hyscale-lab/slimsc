Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, right? And it's expressed as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), which I think is a common factor here. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So let me write that out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

Then, Ay = c * S. So substituting c, that's (h/(4π)) times the matrix S.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I'll need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

First, I'll compute the matrix Ay. Let me calculate each element:

The (1,1) element is c*0 = 0.

The (1,2) element is c*(-i) = (-i)(h/(4π)).

The (2,1) element is c*i = (i)(h/(4π)).

The (2,2) element is c*0 = 0.

So Ay matrix is:
[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Wait, that's the matrix. Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I'll need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a11 - a, a12], [a21, a22 - a]] is (a11 -a)(a22 -a) - a12 a21.

So plugging in the values:

a11 = 0, a22 = 0, a12 = (-i h)/(4π), a21 = (i h)/(4π).

So the determinant becomes:

(0 - a)(0 - a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, because (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2.

What's (-i)(i)? i times i is i² = -1, but with the negative sign, (-i)(i) = - (i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (1) * (h²/(4π)^2).

So the determinant becomes a² - (h²/(4π)^2) = 0.

Solving for a²: a² = (h²)/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π)

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Both are real numbers. So the eigenvalues are real; no imaginary parts here.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or ±h/4π. Wait, but our eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So option A is incorrect because it's talking about imaginary parts, which don't exist here.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Well, our eigenvalues are real and are h/(4π), which is approximately... let's see, h is Planck's constant, about 6.6e-34 J·s. Divided by 4π, which is around 12.56, so h/(4π) is roughly 5.27e-35. Which is way smaller than 1, so option B's eigenvalues don't match. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A squared, but not of Az (the Z-component). Hmm. Well, I know that for angular momentum operators, the square of the angular momentum (like S²) commutes with all components (Sx, Sy, Sz). So if φ is an eigenfunction of Sy, then it's also an eigenfunction of S². But wait, S² is the square of the total angular momentum. So in this case, since Ay is (h/(4π)) S, and S is like the Pauli matrices scaled, right?

Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by the appropriate factors. So if S is in the Pauli matrix form, then S² would be identity matrix. Let me think
