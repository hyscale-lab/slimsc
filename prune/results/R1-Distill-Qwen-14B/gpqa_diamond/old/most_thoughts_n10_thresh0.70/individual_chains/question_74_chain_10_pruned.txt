Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, the question says that there's an atom with a certain decay probability, and after some time has passed without it decaying, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Let me break this down.

Wait, the initial information is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that means there's a 32% chance the atom decays in 100 minutes. Then, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait, so the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the initial 100-minute probability is given. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of half-life or decay constants.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. Radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? The probability that a nucleus decays is given by P = 1 - e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant and t is time.

But wait, the question gives the probability as 32% within 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32. That would mean 1 - e^(-位 * 100) = 0.32. So, e^(-100位) = 0.68. Taking natural logs, -1
