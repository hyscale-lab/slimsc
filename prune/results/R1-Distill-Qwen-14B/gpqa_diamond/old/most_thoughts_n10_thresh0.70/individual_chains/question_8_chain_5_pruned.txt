Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They did some knock-out mutants and tested their resistance.

The setup: they have three genes, G1, G2, G3. Each knockout mutant (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3) were tested. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type). 

The results:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3:10%
- g2g3:0%
- g1g2:0%

Wait, so the wild type is 100%, meaning the higher the percentage, the more resistant. So, lower numbers mean less resistance, more susceptible.

So, what does each individual knockout do? 

g1 is 75%: so it's less resistant than wild type. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but not completely. So, G1 probably contributes to resistance, but isn't the only factor.

g2 is 0%: that's interesting. So, knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance. So, G2 seems essential for resistance. Maybe it's a transcription factor because if it's knocked out, downstream genes can't be activated. 

g3 is 50%: so knocking out G3 reduces resistance by half. So, G3 contributes, but maybe not as much as G2. Or perhaps it's downstream of G2.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So, in the double mutant, the resistance is as bad as g2. Hmm, so what does that imply? Since g2 alone is 0%, adding g1 knockout doesn't change the phenotype. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, meaning G2 is epistatic to G1. Because in the double mutant, you still get the more severe phenotype of G2 knockout. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

g1g3: 10% → that's worse than either g1 or g3 alone. Because g1 is 75 and g3 is 50, but together they're 10, which is way lower. So, the double mutant is much worse than either alone. What does that mean? Could be that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. If they're both knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So, when G2 is knocked out, adding G3 knockout doesn't change the outcome. So again, G2 is epistatic to G3. Because knocking out G3 in a g2 background doesn't make it worse than g2. 

So, putting this together. It looks like G2 is a transcription factor (since it's essential for resistance, as seen in g2). Because in the double mutants with g2, like g1g2 and g2g3, the phenotype is the same as g2. So, G2 is upstream, and its function is required for the other genes to function. 

So, G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream. Then, G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. 

Now, looking at the double mutants: g1 and g3 have some additive or synergistic effect. Because their double mutant (g1g3) is worse than either alone. So, if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower than either. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways downstream of G2. Like, G2 activates both G1 and G3, and both contribute to resistance. 

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would mean that neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. But in the single mutants, g1 and g3 have their own resistance levels. Wait, no, because the single mutants are only knocked out for one gene. So, in g1, G1 is knocked out but G2 and G3 are present. So, the resistance is 75% for g1, which is lower than wild type but not zero. So, G2 is still functional in g1. So, if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it activates other genes, including G1 and G3. 

Wait, but in the single mutants, when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is zero. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen. So, G2 must be part of a critical pathway. 

So, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. When G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are non-functional. But in the single mutants, when only G1 is knocked out, G2 is active and can activate G3 (if G3 is downstream of G2), so the plant can still have some resistance because G3 is functional. Or wait, if G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3, but I don't think that's the case because g3 has 50% which is half of wild type. 

Alternatively, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are both part of the same pathway. So, when you knock out G1, G3 can still contribute, but not as much as when both are active. So, in g1, G3 is active, so resistance is 75%? Wait, no, because in the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active. So, in g1, only G3 is active (but maybe it's not as effective as having both). So, 75% resistance in g1, which is higher than g3's 50%. Oh, wait, that's confusing. 

Wait, in the wild type, all genes are active. So, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75% (so G3 is active). When G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%, so G1 is active. So, G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. Or perhaps they are additive. 

Wait, so if knocking out G1 leaves G3 active, and resistance is 75%, which is higher than
