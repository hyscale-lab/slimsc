Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that's absorbed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. They give me their masses, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. I need to find the correct momentum value from the options.

Wait, fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, right? So the molecule is in its ground state, and it absorbs a photon to go to the next state. But I'm a bit confused about whether it's transitioning in rotation, vibration, or both. The model mentioned is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

In the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But wait, sometimes I get confused whether the fundamental state is the first excited state or the ground state. Oh, right, the ground state is the fundamental state, so v=0, J=0.

Now, the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the next lowest state. What's the next state? Well, the next state would be the one with the least energy increment. So I need to find the energy difference between the ground state and the next possible state. The next state could be either an increase in vibrational state (v=1) or an increase in rotational state (J=1).

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That probably means the smallest energy difference. So I need to calculate both the vibrational energy transition and the rotational energy transition and see which one is smaller.

The energy levels for vibration are quantized as E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = (3/2 ħω) - (1/2 ħω) ) = ħω. So the photon energy for vibration would be ħω.

For rotation, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) )/(2I) ) ħ², where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

Wait, let's compute the reduced mass μ first. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh, wait, I have to convert this into kg because the units will matter.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that. 1.8 * 1.66 is about 3, so 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approximately 2.999e-27 kg. Wait, more accurately:

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's calculate:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889
0.018 * 1.6605 = 0.029889
So total is about 3.018789e-27 kg.

The moment of inertia I = μ r². The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So r² = (2e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m². Therefore, I = 3.018789e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy levels are E_J = [ J (J+1) ] * ħ² / (2I). The ground state is J=0, so the next state is J=1. The energy for J=1 would be E_1 = [1*2] ħ² / (2I) = 2 ħ² / (2I) )= ħ²/(I).

The energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(I)) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon could cause a transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, depending on which requires less energy. We need to find the transition with the least energy, because that's the next lowest state.

So calculate both energy differences and compare.

First, the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħ ω.

The rotational energy difference is ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Compute both and see which is smaller.

Let me compute each:

First, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Now, compute ΔE_rot: ħ² / I.

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.2075e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2075) )e-22 ≈ approx 0.920e-22 J.

Wait, 0.920e-22 J is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait a minute, that's way smaller than the vibrational energy difference of 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

So the molecule would first transition to the next rotational state (J=1) rather than the next vibrational state. Because 9.2e-23 J is much less than 4.2e-20 J.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So that implies the molecule will go to the next energy level possible, which would be the one with the least energy increase.

So if the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one, then the photon needed would have the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So perhaps the next state is a combination of both. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of each mode.

Alternatively, perhaps the model treats rotation and vibration as separate, and the energy levels are sums of the two. So the ground state would be the lowest in both. The next state could be either a rotation increase or a vibration increase.

Wait, but in this problem, the molecule is in the fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible. So the next state would be the one with the least energy increment. That would be either the first rotational level (J=1) or the first vibrational level (v=1).

Wait, so the energy for the first vibrational state is higher than the first rotational state? Because in my calculations, E_rot is much smaller than E_vib.

So the molecule would first go to the J=1 state, requiring a photon with energy E_rot.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum, not its energy. Oh right, because photons have momentum p, and energy E = p c, but wait, actually, for photons, E = h f = pc, so p = E/c.

So to find the momentum of the photon, I need to compute p = E/c, where E is the energy difference between the two states.

Wait, but in the case of rotational transition, the energy is E_rot = ħ²/(2I) * (J=1: 2) - J=0: 0. So E_rot = (2 ħ² )/(2I) ) = ħ² / I.

Wait, let me compute E_rot again.

E_J = [ J (J+1) ] * ħ² / (2 I )

So for J=0: E_0 = 0.

For J=1: E_1 = (2) * ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J, and its momentum p = E/c.

What's c? Approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = (9.2 /3 )e-31 kg·m/s ≈ 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, the options are in the order of 1e-27 or 1e-28 N·s. N·s is kg·m/s, so the units are correct.

Wait, 3.066e-31 kg·m/s is 3.066e-31 N·s, but the options are much larger: 1e-28 is 1000 times bigger than 1e-31.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations step by step.

First, compute the reduced mass, μ.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu.

1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ Let me compute:

1.8 * 1.6605e-27 = 2.9889e-27.

0.01818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 0.0302e-27.

So total μ ≈ (2.9889 + 0.0302) e-27 = 3.0191e-27 kg.

Moment of inertia I = μ r².

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So r² = (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I= μ*r²=3.0191e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.20764e-46 kg·m².

Now, E_rot = ħ²/(I).

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05)^2 is 1.1025, so 1.1025e-68 (since (1e-34)^2=1e-68).

So E_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.20764e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (1.20764e-46) ≈ 9.207e-23 J.

Yes, same as before.

So the energy needed is about 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p = E/c.

E = 9.2e-23 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

p= 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2 /3 )e-31 ≈ 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, none of the options are around 1e-31. The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Wait, that's way off. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternative approach: perhaps the model considers both rotational and vibrational changes? Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider a transition that involves both modes.

Wait, wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but the ground rotational state (J=0). To get to the next state with the lowest possible energy, it would transition to either J=1 (v=0) or v=1 (J=0). But according to the calculations, the energy needed for J=1 is much lower than for v=1. So the photon should have the rotational energy.

But wait, perhaps in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination. So perhaps the next state is (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which one requires less energy?

Compute both:

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would have E_rot =9.2e-23 J, so p=E/c=3e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the simultaneous transition in both rotation and vibration. But that's more complicated and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E_rot.

Let me recheck E_rot.

E_rot for J=0 to J=1.

E_J = (J (J+1) ) * ħ²/(2I)

So for J=0, E_0=0. For J=1, E_1=(1*2) ħ²/(2I) = (2 ħ² )/(2I ) = ħ²/(I).

Yes, that's correct. So E_rot = ħ²/(I) = 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm, but maybe the problem is considering the first excited state of vibration, which is v=1. So the energy would be 3/2 ħω - 1/2 ħω = ħω. But that gives 4.2e-20 J, which is way higher than the rotational transition.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule is in the rotational ground state but vibrational first state. No, the question says it's in the fundamental state, which is the ground state of both.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which might have a different expression for rotational energy, but I think the formula is similar.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next energy level, regardless of mode, which would be the lower of the two.

Wait, but the problem is about the photon's momentum. So if the correct energy is 9.2e-23 J, then p = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.06e-31 N·s.

Looking at the options, none match this. The smallest option is D) 1.4e-28, which is 400 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass or the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me recheck the reduced mass.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22=20/11≈1.81818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg.

So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = let me compute more accurately.

1.81818 * 1 = 1.81818e-27.

1.81818 * 0.6605e-27? Wait, wait no, perhaps I should compute 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27.

Calculate 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889.

Then 0.01818 *1.6605 = 0.03018.

So total is 2.9889 +0.03018 = 3.01908e-27 kg.

So μ is about 3.019e-27 kg.

Wait, earlier I thought I was getting 3.019e-27 kg, but in the moment of inertia, I did r^2=4e-20 m².

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the bond length. The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is 4e-20 m², correct.

So I= μ * R² = 3.019e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2076e-46 kg·m².

E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2076e-46).

So (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = (1.112 /1.2076 )e-22 ≈ 0.920e-22 =9.2e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before. So the energy is indeed 9.2e-23 J. Which gives p ≈3e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the next higher state, which is a vibrational transition, not rotational. But why would that be?

Because perhaps the rotational energy levels are too close and we can't detect them, but the question is about the photon's momentum, not the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon momentum for a vibrational transition.

Wait, for the vibrational transition, E = ħω.

So p = E/c = (ħ ω)/c.

Compute that:

ħ =1.05457e-34 J·s.

ω=4e14 rad/s.

So E=1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p=4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s, which is 1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. So that's a match.

Wait a minute, why did my earlier assumption that the rotational transition requires less energy lead me to a wrong answer? Because when I compared the energy differences, the rotational was smaller. But that would suggest that the molecule would preferentially transition via rotation. But in the options, the correct answer seems to be the vibrational one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference. Let me double-check.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, and the next state is the first vibrational excited state, regardless of rotation. But why would that be if the rotational transition requires less energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition because the rotational modes are not considered—maybe it's a different model.

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, but perhaps the model requires that both modes change together, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy; perhaps the rotational energy difference is higher.

Wait, let me recompute the rotational energy.

E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2076e-46 kg·m²).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 (as before).

Denominator: 1.2076e-46.

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2076) * 1e-22 = approx 0.92 *1e-22 =9.2e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So E_rot is 9.2e-23 J.

E_vib is 4.2e-20 J.

So E_rot is about 43 times smaller than E_vib.

Hmm, so why is the photon's energy for the rotational transition not matching any of the options? Because the options don't go that low.

Wait, perhaps I messed up in calculating E_rot. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the rotational energy levels is different. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ) ħ²/(2I).

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (2) ħ²/(2I ) = ħ²/(I).

Yes, same as before.

Hmm, so the rotational transition requires less energy, so it should happen. But in the options, the only photon momentum that matches is option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the transition to the next state, which in this context is the first excited state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1) and not the rotational.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because the rotational energy is much smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again. The problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next possible states are (v=1, J=0), (v=0, J=1), (v=1, J=1), etc. The energy of each state is E = E_v + E_J.

The next state with the lowest energy would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). We need to compute which one has lower total energy.

So compute E for both.

E_J=1: E_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈9.2e-23 J.

E_v=1: E_vib = ħ ω ≈4.2e-20 J.

So (v=0, J=1) has lower energy than (v=1, J=0). Therefore, the molecule would transition to (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon with energy 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's momentum is E/c=9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg·m/s. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, but the options are all much larger. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state (which is J=0, v=0) to the next state, which is J=0, v=1. Because maybe the model only considers vibrational transitions as allowed.

Wait, but why? The model is the rotation-vibration model, which should allow for both.

Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem statement.

The question says: the molecule is in its fundamental state. What momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?

So the next state would have the next higher energy. The next possible state would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which one has lower energy?

E_v=1, J=0: E = 4.2e-20 J.

E_v=0, J=1: E=9.2e-23 J.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), so the photon should provide 9.2e-23 J.

But that gives momentum 3e-31 N·s, which is not among the options.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me recheck.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) amu =40/22=1.818 amu.

μ in kg is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.019e-27 kg.

I=μ R² =3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

E_rot= ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 /1.2076e-46.

So (1.05457e-34)^2= 1.112e-68.

1.112e-68 /1.2076e-46 = 9.2e-23 J.

So no mistake here.

Wait, but perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which has a different formula for the moment of inertia. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model (like the Morse potential) might use a different approach, but for the moment of inertia, I think it's still μ r², but r might not be fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spectroscopic transition which involves both rotational and vibrational changes. But in that case, the energy would be a combination.

Wait, considering the selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions usually accompany vibrational transitions. So, in practice, a photon might cause a vibrational transition with a simultaneous rotational transition.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy increment is the rotational transition, but it's unclear if this is considered in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering vibrational transitions, but that would be unlikely given the model stated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the translational energy. But no, the question is about rotation and vibration.

Another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first vibrational state (v=1), regardless of rotation. Because in some cases, the ground state (v=0) could have multiple rotational levels, but the next state with the lowest energy is the first vibrational state.

Wait, but no: the rotational state J=1 has lower energy than the vibrational state v=1.

I think I'm stuck here. The calculations suggest the photon momentum should be ~3e-31 N·s, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the conversion of amu to kg. Let me recheck.

1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ= (20 *2)/(20+2) amu =40/22 amu=20/11 amu≈1.81818 amu.

So μ in kg: 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Let me compute this accurately:

1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 = ?

Compute 1.8 *1.660539e-27 = 2.989e-27.

0.01818 *1.660539e-27 = approx 0.03018e-27.

So total is 3.019e-27 kg. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the rotational energy as (J (J+1) ) * ħ²/(2I ), but maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E_J = ( J (J+1 ) ħ² ) / ( I ), not divided by 2. No, no, the correct formula for the rotational energy levels is:

E_J = [ J (J+1 ) ] ħ² / (2 I )

So for J=1: 2 * ħ²/(2 I ) ) = ħ²/(I ). So yes, correct.

I'm not seeing a mistake in the calculations. So perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, which gives 1.4e-28 N·s (option D), even though the rotational transition requires less energy.

But why would that be? Maybe the question is only considering the vibrational transition, perhaps the model doesn't include rotation, but the question says it does.

Alternatively, perhaps the question's model only allows for vibrational transitions, but that seems contradictory.

Another possibility: maybe the problem is considering the energy of the photon required to reach the next energy level, regardless of which transition it is. So, if the photon's energy corresponds to the vibrational transition, which is much larger than the rotational, but the options don't have the rotational's value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the photon's wavelength or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's angular momentum, not linear momentum. But that's a different concept, and the question asks for linear momentum.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reduced mass is computed as (Mx * My ) / (Mx + My ), but in the calculation of I, should it be (Mx My )/(Mx + My ), which is correct, so that's right.

Wait, maybe the formula for the rotational energy is different. Another approach: let's compute the rotational constant B, which is ħ²/(2 I ).

Then E_J = B J (J+1).

So B = ħ²/(2 I ).

Compute B:

I = 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2076e-46 ) = (1.112e-68)/(2.415e-46 )= approx 4.6e-23 J.

Then E_J for J=1 is 4.6e-23 * 2=9.2e-23 J. Same as before.

Hmm.

So, considering all possibilities, I'm confident that the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. But the answer options don't have anything near 3e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for the moment of inertia.

Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I=μ * R²=3.019e-27 kg *4e-20 m²= 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy and not momentum. But no, the question asks for momentum.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is about 4.6e-29 J (since E=pc, p= E/c => E=p c ). Wait, no, wait: E=pc because for photons, E=pc.

Wait, no, for photons, E = h f = pc, so p=E/c.

So if p is 1.4e-28 Ns (kg·m/s), then E = pc = 1.4e-28 *3e8 =4.2e-20 J.

Which matches the vibrational energy. So option D corresponds to the vibrational transition.

But according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is the answer considering the vibrational?

Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next state, not the next higher energy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first rotational state, but that's not possible because the rotational states are quantized within each vibrational state.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor but not accounting for the vibrational energy. So the next state is the first rotational state, but then why is the answer option D?

I'm getting stuck. Since the only option that matches the vibrational transition is D, perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why would that be the case, given that the rotational transition requires less energy.

Ah, wait! Maybe the question is considering the transition not from the ground state but from the first vibrational state. No, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the ground state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but within the same vibrational state, which is the correct approach. But then why is the answer not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me compute it again.

E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2076e-46).

Compute 1.05457e-34 squared:

1.05457^2 ≈ 1.112.

So (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.2076e-46:

1.112e-68 /1.2076e-46 = (1.112/1.2076) * 1e-22.

1.112 /1.2076 ≈ 0.920.

So 0.920e-22 =9.2e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So the photon's momentum is 9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.06e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is considering the transition from the vibrational ground state (v=0) to the first vibrational excited state (v=1), regardless of rotation. Because in some cases, the rotational transitions are not allowed or are not considered.

But I don't think that's the case here because the question explicitly mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next available state, which may involve both a vibrational and rotational change.

Wait, perhaps the next state is (v=1, J=1), which would have energy E_v + E_rot. But that would be higher than either transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but only within the same vibrational state, which is the rotational transition.

But then the photon's momentum would be 3e-31 Ns, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe the question is actually about the rotational transition, and I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute E_rot as the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is E_J=1 - E_J=0 = ħ²/(I) =9.2e-23 J.

So p= E/c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) )= 3.066e-31 kg·m/s = 3.066e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match. So I'm at a loss.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both vibrational and rotational transitions. But that would be higher than either, so the momentum would be higher than option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the moment of inertia I is computed with the wrong formula. For a diatomic, the moment of inertia is μ r², which I have done.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Given that the only option matching the vibrational transition is D, perhaps the intended answer is D, even though my calculations suggest it should be the rotational one. But I'm not sure why that would be. Maybe the question is wrong, or I made a mistake.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is actually about the photon's energy, and in the options, it's expressed in terms of momentum, but perhaps I should compute using different formulas.

Wait, maybe using the formula for the photon's momentum in terms of frequency: p = ħ * k, where k is the wavevector. And since E = ħ ω, p= E/c = ħ ω /c.

Wait, for the vibrational transition, E= ħω. So p= ħω/(c).

Compute that:

ω=4e14 rad/s.

So p= (1.05457e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s ) / (3e8 m/s )

= (4.218e-20 J ) /3e8 m/s =1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 1.406e-28 N·s, matching option D.

So perhaps the problem expects the answer to be D, considering the vibrational transition.

But according to my earlier analysis, the rotational transition requires less energy, so I'm confused. But perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, or perhaps the rotational transition isn't allowed in this context.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but in the highest possible rotational state, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the next vibrational state, regardless of rotation.

In any case, given that option D matches the vibrational photon momentum, and the other options don't, perhaps the intended answer is D.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The molecule consists of atoms X and Y with masses \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \) and \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \), a bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} \), and an angular frequency of vibration \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]  
   Converting to kilograms:  
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is given by \( I = \mu R^2 \). With \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   I = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 4 \times 10^{-20} \approx 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Energy Differences**:  
   - **Rotational Transition**:  
     The rotational energy levels are \( E_J = \frac{J(J+1) \hbar^2}{2I} \). For \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \):  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
     \]  
     Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

   - **Vibrational Transition**:  
     The vibrational energy levels are \( E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \). For \( v = 0 \to v = 1 \):  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega.
     \]  
     Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   - For the rotational transition:  
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]  
     This value is much smaller than any of the provided options.  

   - For the vibrational transition:  
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]  
     This matches **Option D**.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   While the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem likely assumes the next state refers to the vibrational transition. This aligns with **Option D**, which corresponds to the vibrational photon momentum.
