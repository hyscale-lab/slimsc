Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned in either the up or down state relative to a magnetic field. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the z-component of the spin. 

Initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Hmm. So, wait, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian governing the system's energy will change. The particle's spin will precess around the new field direction, which is Y. But how does that affect the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment?

I think the key here is to model the time evolution of the spin state under the new Hamiltonian. The spin-1/2 system has a magnetic moment mu = gamma S, where S is the spin operator. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to the magnetic moment dotted with the magnetic field. 

Initially, the field is along Z, so the Hamiltonian H_initial is proportional to Sz. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the spin-up and spin-down states along Z. 

But when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = gamma * B * S_y, right? Because the magnetic field is now along Y. Wait, actually, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B, but I think the sign might not matter for the frequency here. Or maybe it does? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = gamma * B * S_y, since mu = gamma S, and the field is along Y. 

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so when the field is along Y, the interaction energy is - mu · B = - gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian H is - gamma B S_y. But maybe the sign doesn't affect the oscillation frequency, so I can proceed ignoring the sign for the purposes of frequency calculation.

The time evolution of the system will be governed by this new Hamiltonian. The initial state is the eigenstate of H_initial, which is either |+z> or |-z>. But which one is it? The problem says the magnetic moment is aligned with the initial field, so if the field is along +Z, the particle is in the state where its spin is up along Z, |+z>.

Wait, the initial state is an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian, but when the Hamiltonian changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new one. So the spin state will evolve over time. The expectation value of Sz will oscillate because the state will precess around the Y-axis.

I remember that for spin systems, the time evolution under a Hamiltonian H can be described using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The expectation value of an observable O will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy difference between states.

Let me think about the energy levels. The new Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. So the eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenvalues are ± (gamma B/2), since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and here gamma multiplied by B gives the energy. Wait, no, wait. Let's see: H = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E_+ = (-gamma B)(ħ/2), and E_- = (+gamma B)(ħ/2), because S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, and similarly for |-y>. So the energy levels are plus and minus (gamma B ħ)/2, but the actual sign depends on the direction of the field and the spin orientation. 

But perhaps I should think in terms of the Rabi oscillation frequency. Rabi oscillations occur when a two-level system is subjected to an oscillating field, but in this case, the system's Hamiltonian is time-independent after the field is switched. Wait, no, the field is switched abruptly, so the system will undergo precession under the new Hamiltonian.

The time evolution will cause the spin state to precess around the Y-axis. The oscillation frequency of the expectation value of Sz would depend on the energy splitting between the states. 

The energy difference between the two eigenstates of H is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B (ħ/2)) - (+gamma B (ħ/2)) ) = -gamma B ħ. Wait, no, let me recalculate that. Wait, H is proportional to S_y. Let me write H = ω S_y, where ω is some frequency. Because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, the energies are ± (ω ħ)/2. The energy difference is therefore ω ħ. 

Wait, let me clarify. H = gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ. 

The time evolution of the expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency given by the energy splitting divided by ħ. So the frequency nu is (E_plus - E_minus) / (2π ħ), but wait, let me think about how the expectation value oscillates.

Alternatively, the time dependence of the spin components can be determined using the time evolution operator. The initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of H. 

Wait, the initial state is |+z>. The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, which are the spin-up and spin-down along Y. The initial state |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

Let me find the expansion. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y>, each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2).

The time evolution under H is given by |ψ(t)> = e^(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>.

Since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of H, their time evolution will be multiplied by a phase factor.

So let's compute this. H |+y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>, so the time evolution is e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} |+y> = e^{-i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} |+y> = e^{-i (gamma B t / 2)} |+y>.

Similarly, H |-y> = - gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>, so the phase is e^{-i (-gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} = e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |-y>.

So the state |ψ(t)> becomes:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |+y> + e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |-y> ].

Now, we can express this back in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

Substituting the expressions for |+y> and |-y>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting these into |ψ(t)>:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) + e^{i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Simplify the expression:

Multiply (1/sqrt(2)) with each term inside:

= [1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))] [ e^{-i phi} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{i phi} (|+z> - |-z>) ) ]

Where phi = gamma B t/2.

sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 1/(2) [ ... ]

Expanding the terms inside:

= (1/2) [ (e^{-i phi} + e^{i phi}) |+z> + (e^{-i phi} - e^{i phi}) |-z> ]

Using Euler's formula, e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta; e^{-i theta} - e^{i theta} = -2i sin theta.

So this becomes:

= (1/2) [ 2 cos(phi) |+z> - 2i sin(phi) |-z> ]

Simplify:

= cos(phi) |+z> - i sin(phi) |-z>

Thus, the state |ψ(t)> is cos(phi)|+z> - i sin(phi)|-z>, where phi = gamma B t/2.

Now, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let's compute this. The spin operator S_z has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |+z> and -ħ/2 for |-z>.

So the expectation value is:

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [ cos(phi) < +z | - i sin(phi) < -z | ] [ S_z ] [ cos(phi) |+z> - i sin(phi)|-z> ]

Multiplying this out:

= cos(phi) * cos(phi) < +z | S_z | +z > + cos(phi)* (-i sin(phi)) < +z | S_z | -z > 
+ (-i sin(phi)) * cos(phi) < -z | S_z | +z > + (-i sin(phi))^2 < -z | S_z | -z >.

But S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>.

So the cross terms (the second and third terms) involve inner products like < +z | S_z | -z >, which is zero because S_z | -z > = (-ħ/2)|-z>, and < +z | -z> is zero. So only the first and last terms contribute.

So:

= cos^2(phi) (ħ/2) + [ (-i sin(phi)) * (-i sin(phi)) ] * ( -ħ/2 )

Wait, let's compute each term correctly.

Wait, no, let me re-express the expectation value calculation. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value for S_z in the state |ψ(t)>.

The state |ψ(t)> is cos(phi)|+z> -i sin(phi)|-z>.

The expectation value <S_z> is:

cos^2(phi) * (ħ/2) + sin^2(phi) * (-ħ/2).

Because the state is a linear combo of |+z> and |-z>, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities (mod squared) multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So:

<S_z> = [ cos^2(phi) * (1/2 ħ) ] + [ sin^2(phi) * (-1/2 ħ) ]

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) ]

Using the double-angle identity cos(2phi) = cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi), this becomes:

= (ħ/2) cos(2phi)

But wait, phi is gamma B t/2, so 2phi is gamma B t.

So:

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t)

Wait, but the problem mentions the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.

So <mu_z> = gamma * <S_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, no. Wait, mu = gamma S, so the magnetic moment is mu = gamma times the spin. So, the z-component is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.

So <mu_z> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because earlier, the energy was H = gamma B S_y, so when we found the time evolution, phi was (gamma B t)/2. So 2 phi is gamma B t.

But when computing <S_z>, we have (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). 

Wait, but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component. So the oscillation is in cos(gamma B t), meaning the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The frequency of the oscillation is the coefficient of t in the cosine function divided by 2π. So the angular frequency omega is gamma B, which implies the frequency ν is gamma B/(2π). But the options don't have 2π in them. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, I think the question refers to the oscillation frequency as the angular frequency, which is gamma B. Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B.

But wait, when I derived <mu_z>, I had gamma times (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). But wait, the spin S has units of ħ/2, so when multiplied by gamma (which has units of (magnetic moment)/(spin)), the product gamma S has units of magnetic moment. So all the terms are correct.

But wait, the frequency of the oscillation in <mu_z> is gamma B, so the option B.

But wait another moment. Let me check the initial setup. The Hamiltonian after switching the field is H = gamma B S_y. The energy levels are E_plus = gamma B (ħ/2), E_minus = -gamma B (ħ/2). The energy difference is E_plus - E_minus = gamma B ħ. The angular frequency omega is (E_plus - E_minus)/ħ = gamma B.

So the time evolution is oscillating with frequency omega = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking back at the options, option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the Rabi oscillation. In Rabi oscillations when you have a spin in a magnetic field, the frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the field. So if the field is in the y-direction, perhaps the precession is around y, leading to oscillations in the z-component at the Larmor frequency. 

Wait, the Larmor frequency is given by omega_L = gamma B. So yes, the oscillation frequency should be gamma B. So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes to $H = \gamma B S_y$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, either $|+z\rangle$ or $|-z\rangle$. After the field is switched, the new Hamiltonian $H = \gamma B S_y$ governs the time evolution. The eigenstates of $H$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:

\[
|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
\]

Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:

\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}} |+y\rangle + e^{i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}} |-y\rangle \right).
\]

Rewriting this in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$, the state becomes:

\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|+z\rangle - i \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|-z\rangle.
\]

The expectation value of $S_z$ is:

\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right),
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
\]

The magnetic moment $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, so the expectation value of $\mu_z$ is:

\[
\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
\]

The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ occurs at the angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**B) $\gamma B$.**
