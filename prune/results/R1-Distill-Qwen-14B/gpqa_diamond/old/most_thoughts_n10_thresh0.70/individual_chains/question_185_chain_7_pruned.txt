Okay, so I've got this question about the Hamiltonian operator and its eigenvalues. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me think through it.

The question says the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is a unit vector. So σ · n would be the sum of each Pauli matrix component multiplied by the corresponding component of n.

Wait, Pauli matrices. Each σ_i (i=x,y,z) is a 2x2 matrix. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² +n_z² =1.

I remember that for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 for each component, but when you take a linear combination like this, the eigenvalues of the whole thing would be the same as the magnitude. Oh wait, no, wait. Because the operator σ · n is a 2x2 matrix, and it's a sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by n's components.

Wait, the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix are ±1. But when you have a combination like σ · n, which is a sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by n_i, what's its eigenvalue?

Alternatively, I think about the operator σ · n acting on a spin state. The eigenvalues should represent the possible spin projections in that direction. Spin in direction n would have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2, but wait, no—wait, the actual Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by some constants, perhaps.

Wait, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. So perhaps each Pauli matrix is multiplied by ε times the corresponding n component. So σ · n is a matrix, and the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so the eigen
