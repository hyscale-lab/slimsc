Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, we have an electron and a positron moving towards each other, and they annihilate into two photons. The question is about the angle between the two photons. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum are conserved.

Wait, the electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Lorentz factor gamma is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, gamma=4 for the electron. The positron is moving from the right with gamma=2.

Since they're moving along the same horizontal axis but opposite directions, their velocities are opposite. Let me think about their energies and momenta. For relativistic particles, the energy is gamma * m * c² and momentum is gamma * m * v. But wait, for electrons and positrons, they have the same mass, right?

So, the electron has gamma_e = 4, and the positron gamma_p = 2. Let me compute their energies and momenta. 

Electron's energy E_e = gamma_e * m_e c² = 4 m_e c². Its momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e. But wait, v_e can be expressed in terms of gamma. Let me think: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). For gamma=4, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c*sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.968c. So, p_e = gamma * m_e v_e = 4 m_e c (sqrt(15)/4) )= m_e c sqrt(15). Oh wait, because 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) is sqrt(15). So p_e is sqrt(15) m_e c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2. So, E_p = 2 m_e c². Its momentum p_p would be gamma_p * m_e v_p. Let's find v_p. v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2²)) )= c
