Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that we have a single atom whose decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed without decay. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember something about radioactive decay being a Poisson process and that the decay process is memoryless. Oh right, the decay probability depends only on the remaining time, not on how much time has already passed. That's the key here. So even though 50 minutes have gone by without decay, it doesn't affect the future probability. The atom doesn't 'remember' how long it's been since it was formed.

Wait, but the initial probability given is 32% over 100 minutes. So maybe the decay follows an exponential law. The general formula for the probability of decay within a time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

Right. So first, I can find λ using the given data. Let's see. The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me rearrange that: e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100. Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately... I think ln(0.7) is around -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7. Maybe around -0.4 (I should probably compute it more accurately, but maybe I can just proceed symbolically for now).

So λ is (ln(1/0.68))/100 = ln(1.4792899)/100. Because 1/0.68 ≈1.479. Let me get the exact value. ln(1.479) is about 0.391. So λ ≈ 0.391 / 100 = 0.00391 per minute.

Wait, but wait. Let me just compute ln(0.68) accurately. Let me think. I can use a calculator if I were doing this, but since I'm just thinking, maybe approximate it. ln(0.68) is negative, as I said. Let's see, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.6) is around -0.5108, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, ln(0.8) is about -0.2231. So 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7. It's closer to 0.7. Let me interpolate. From 0.6 (ln=-0.5108) to 0.7 (ln=-0.3567). The difference is 0.1 in x, which is 0.0511 in ln. 0.68 is 0.08 above 0.6, so 0.08/0.1=0.8 of the way. So the ln would be -0.5108 + 0.8*(0.5108 - 0.3567) = wait, no, because the change is from higher to lower. Wait, as x increases from 0.6 to 0.7, ln(x) increases from -0.5108 to -0.3567. So the change is +0.1541 over 0.1 in x. So 0.08/0.1 = 0.8, so 0.8 * 0.1541 = 0.1233. So ln(0.68) ≈ -0.5108 + 0.1233 = approximately -0.3875.

So λ = (0.3875) / 100 ≈ 0.003875 per minute.

But wait, maybe I should just use the exact formula without approximating. Let me re-express the problem.

We know that P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t). So at t=100, P=0.32, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking ln, -100λ = ln(0.68), so λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Now, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, but wait, does that mean from the current time (50 minutes have passed), so the remaining 150 minutes? Or does it mean a total of 150 minutes from the start? Because the question states, "the next 150 minutes." So the total time from when we started monitoring is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or wait, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and we're asking about the next 150. So the time period is 150 minutes after the 50th minute. So the total time is 200 minutes from the start.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as after 50 minutes, what's the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes (so up to 200 minutes). But since the process is memoryless, the probability only depends on the remaining time. So whether the total time is 200 minutes, or whether it's 150 minutes from the current time, it's the same as the probability from time 0 to 150 minutes, because the decay is independent of the past. Wait, no. Because after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150. Or is the question about the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, regardless of what happens beyond that? Hmm.

Wait, the question is, "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes." So that's from the current time (50 minutes passed) to 50+150=200 minutes. So the time period is 150 minutes from now, but the total time since the start is 200 minutes.

But because the decay is memoryless, the probability from now until 200 minutes is the same as the probability of decay within 150 minutes, starting from now. So it's P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

So I need to compute λ using the initial data.

So first, find λ.

We have 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68.

Take natural log:

-100λ = ln(0.68) => λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

So λ = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.4792899)/100.

Calculating ln(1.4792899). Let's see, ln(1.4) is about 0.3365, ln(1.5)=0.4055, 1.479 is closer to 1.5. Let me compute ln(1.479):

Using the approximation, let me recall that ln(1.5) is 0.4055, and ln(1.479) would be a bit less. Let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator. But since I don't have one, I'll proceed with the previously approximated value.

Wait, earlier I calculated ln(0.68) as approximately -0.3875, so λ is 0.3875/100 ≈ 0.003875 per minute.

So then, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Plugging in λ:

P = 1 - e^(-0.003875 * 150).

Calculate the exponent: 0.003875 * 150 = 0.58125.

So e^(-0.58125) ≈ ?

I need to compute e^(-0.58125). Let's think about e^0.58. e^0.5 is about 1.6487. e^0.6=1.8221. So 0.58 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate e^0.58.

Using Taylor series around 0.5: e^0.5 = 1.6487, e^0.58 = e^(0.5 + 0.08) = e^0.5 * e^0.08. e^0.08 is approximately 1 + 0.08 + (0.08)^2/2 + (0.08)^3/6 ≈ 1.0833 (since 0.08^2 is 0.0064, 0.0064/2=0.0032; 0.08^3 is 0.000512, /6= ~0.000085. So sum is 1 +0.08 +0.0032 +0.000085≈1.083285. So e^0.08≈1.0833.

So e^0.58 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0833 ≈ 1.793. So e^(-0.58) ≈ 1/1.793 ≈ approximately 0.557.

But wait, the exponent is -0.58125, which is a little less than -0.58. So e^(-0.58125) is slightly less than 0.557. Let me think, maybe around 0.555.

So P ≈ 1 - 0.555 = 0.445, which is about 44.5% probability.

Looking at the options, option C is 52%, D is 48%, A is 44%. Hmm, 44.5% is closest to option A) 44%.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations because perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait another approach: perhaps using the given that the probability is 32% in 100 minutes, which is P(100)=0.32. So P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So e^(-λ*100)=0.68. So λ= ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ (0.387)/100 ≈0.00387 per minute.

Now, for the next 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes in, the time is 150 minutes. So P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.00387 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.5805).

Compute e^(-0.5805). Let me calculate that more accurately.

e^(-0.58) is about 0.562. Because e^(-0.58) = 1/e^0.58. Let me compute e^0.58.

We know that e^0.5 is about 1.64872. e^0.6 is about 1.8221188. So e^0.58 is between these two. Let me compute it linearly:

At x=0.5, e^x=1.64872; x=0.6, e^x=1.8221.

The difference between x=0.5 and x=0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the increase in e^x is about 1.8221 - 1.64872 = 0.17338.

We can approximate e^0.58 as follows:

At x=0.58, it's 0.08 above 0.5. So the change would be 0.08/0.1 * 0.17338 ≈ 0.08 * 1.7338 ≈ 0.1387. So e^0.58 ≈1.64872 + 0.1387 ≈1.7874. So e^(-0.58) ≈1/1.7874 ≈0.558.

So 1 - 0.558 = 0.442, or 44.2%. So about 44%, which is option A.

But wait, the initial calculation said 0.32 in 100 minutes. If I compute exactly, perhaps the actual λ is a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximating. So P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100) because P(t) = 1 - (0.68)^(t/100), since e^(-λ t) = (e^(-λ *100))^(t/100) = (0.68)^(t/100). Wait, wait, that's a crucial point. Because e^(-λ t) = (e^(-λ*100))^(t/100) = (0.68)^(t/100).

So P(t) = 1 - 0.68^(t/100).

So for t=150 minutes, P=1 - 0.68^(150/100) = 1 - 0.68^1.5.

So compute 0.68^1.5.

0.68^1 is 0.68. 0.68^0.5 is sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246.

So 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607.

So P=1 - 0.5607=0.4393, or 43.93%, which is approximately 44%. So option A.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake here. Because e^(-λ t) is (e^(-λ *100))^(t/100) = (0.68)^(t/100). So yes, that's correct. So for t=150 minutes, P=1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, 43.93% ≈ 44%.

So the answer would be option A) 44%.

But wait, another approach: perhaps we can model the survival probability as (1 - 0.32) = 0.68 for 100 minutes, then the decay probability in the next 150 minutes would be (1 - (0.68)^(150/100)).

Wait, that formula is correct because after 100 minutes, the survival probability is 0.68, and for an additional t minutes, the survival is (0.68)^(t/100). So the decay probability is 1 - (0.68)^(t/100).

So for t=150, it's 1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 43.9% as before.

But let me think again about the initial setup. The decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. So yes, that setup is correct.

So the correct answer is approximately 44%, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The probability of decay within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t},
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can determine \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}.
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68).
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}.
\]

Approximating \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3875 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3875}{100} \approx 0.003875 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003875 \):

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.003875 \cdot 150}.
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
0.003875 \cdot 150 \approx 0.58125.
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.58125}.
\]

Approximating \( e^{-0.58125} \approx 0.555 \), we find:

\[
P(150) \approx 1 - 0.555 = 0.445 \, \text{or} \, 44.5\%.
\]

This value is closest to 44%, which corresponds to option A.

To confirm, we can use an alternative approach. The survival probability after 100 minutes is \( 0.68 \). For the next 150 minutes, the survival probability is:

\[
\text{Survival} = (0.68)^{150/100} = (0.68)^{1.5}.
\]

Approximating \( (0.68)^{1.5} \approx 0.5607 \), the decay probability is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 \, \text{or} \, 43.93\%.
\]

This also rounds to 44%. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
