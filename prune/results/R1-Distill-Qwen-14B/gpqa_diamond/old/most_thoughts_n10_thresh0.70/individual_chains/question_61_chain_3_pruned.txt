Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product step by step. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The starting material is benzene. Then it's treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene requires a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. So the first reaction is nitration. Benzene undergoes nitration to form nitrotoluene? Wait, no, benzene with nitration gives nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Iron and Br2 is a bromination reagent, but wait, when you have a nitro group on benzene, that's a meta-directing group. So bromine in presence of Fe would add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So nitrobenzene reacting with Br2 and Fe would give meta-bromonitrobenzene. So product 2 is 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene? Or wait, nitro is in position 1, then bromine would be in 3.

Wait, maybe I should draw this. Nitro group is in position 1. The bromine addition would occur meta to it, so position 3. So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene.

Then product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's hydrogenation, probably reducing the nitro group. Nitro group (NO2) upon hydrogenation with Pd would become an amino group (NH2). So product 3 would have an amino group where the nitro was. So product 3 is 3-bromoaniline. Structure is benzene with NH2 in position 1 and Br in position 3? Wait, no. Wait, product 2 is 3-bromo nitrobenzene. So when nitro is in position 1, bromine in position 3. Then reducing nitro to amine would give amino in position 1, bromine in position 3.

Then product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4. That sounds like a diazotization reaction. Diaz
