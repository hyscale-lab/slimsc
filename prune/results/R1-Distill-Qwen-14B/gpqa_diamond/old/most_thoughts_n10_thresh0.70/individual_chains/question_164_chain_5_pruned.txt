Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2. 

The problem says that both systems have periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, period is the time it takes for them to orbit each other once. So system_1's period is 2 years, system_2's is 1 year. 

Then, the radial velocities (RVs) are given. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. RV amplitude indicates the speed at which the stars are moving towards or away from us. The bigger the amplitude, the more massive the star, I think. Wait, no, not exactly. 

I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit. So the less massive star moves faster, and the more massive one moves slower. So the RV amplitude is related to the mass. Oh right, the more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's less affected by the other star's gravity.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. So K1 is the velocity of star 1, K2 of star 2. The mass ratio would be M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1). Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So if star 1 has a higher K, it's less massive. 

So for system_1, the two stars have K of 10 and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio (M1a/M1b) would be (5)/(10) = 0.5. So M1a is half the mass of M1b. Wait, wait, no, because M1a is the more massive star if K1a is smaller. Wait, for system_1, star 1's K is 10, star 2's K is 5. So M1a is less massive than M1b? Because K is inversely proportional to mass. So M1a = (K1b * M1) / K1a. Wait, maybe I should
