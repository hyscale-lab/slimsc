Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and figuring out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star. Oh wait, more specifically, it's about the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The transit method works best when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how do I calculate the probability?

I think the formula for the probability (P) of a transit is something like P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But wait, R_planet is usually much smaller than R_star, so maybe it's approximated as R_star / a_planet. Or wait, no, I think the exact formula is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (something else... like the impact parameter?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no, more accurately, the probability that a planet transits is roughly proportional to (R_star / a_planet). Because a planet with a smaller orbit (smaller a) has a higher chance of its path crossing our line of sight. But wait, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the geometric probability.

Oh right, the geometric probability (which is the same as the transit probability) is given by the formula: P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star, R_planet is negligible, so P ≈ R_star / a_planet.

But wait, another factor comes into play because the planet's orbit must be aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The planet has a certain orbital period, and the star's mass affects the size of the orbit, right?

Wait, the orbital period is given for both planets. The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (P1 = P2 / 3).

Using Kepler's third law, which says (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_star + m_planet)) / (4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_star + m_planet ≈ M_star. So
