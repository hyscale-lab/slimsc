Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but propene is more common when talking about brominations. Well, maybe it's propene. Then, compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4 to form B. Oh right, that's a typical addition reaction. So if A is propene, which is CH2=CH2CH3, then bromination would add Br2 across the double bond.

Wait, no, more accurately, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would react with Br2 in CCl4. The bromine would add to the double bond, making a dibromide. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. Or wait, let me correct that. Adding Br2 to propene (CH2CH2CH3?) Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Oh right, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, but wait, no, the addition is across the double bond. So the structure would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, propene is CH2CHCH3? Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds across the double
