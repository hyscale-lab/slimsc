Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. After both reactions, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation is when a double bond reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. So each reaction probably forms an epoxide.

Wait, but wait. Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 is with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both treated with one equivalent of mCPBA. Then they're treated with aqueous acid.

Wait, what's the product of epoxidation followed by acid workup? Oh right! When an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it typically undergoes ring-opening. The ring-opening of an epoxide under acidic conditions usually leads to the formation of diols, specifically vicinal diols, where the two hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons.

So, the first step is epoxidation, and the second is acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form diols. Now, the key here is the stereochemistry of the starting alkenes and how that affects the epoxide structure, which in turn affects the diol structure.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5, and the substituents on each carbon are opposite each other. So for (E), the groups on either side are opposite. When mCPBA adds to the double bond, it forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. Wait, mCPBA is a peracid, which reacts with alkenes in a way that forms an epoxide with trans stereochemistry. Because the peracid attacks the less substituted side, but in general, the epoxidation leads to a trans epoxide.

Wait, no, wait. For the epoxidation of alkenes, the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen comes in with a certain stereochemistry. Wait, in epoxidation, the two new oxygen bonds are formed with the same face? Oh, right, because the peracid approaches the same face of the double bond. So the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, let me think again. So the starting alkene is (E) or (Z). Epoxidation with mCPBA would form an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are added across the double bond in a cis fashion. Because mCPBA adds to the same face. So,
