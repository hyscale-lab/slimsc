Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, during TLC analysis, the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. We need to figure out which options are the possible products.

Hmm, first I should visualize the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking it down: the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The other part is a butenyl group. The structure of the butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Wait, butene is four carbons with a double bond. The position is 3-en, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-benzene? Wait, no. Wait, but the substituents are at 2,2-dimethyl. So the butenyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O- benzene? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait
