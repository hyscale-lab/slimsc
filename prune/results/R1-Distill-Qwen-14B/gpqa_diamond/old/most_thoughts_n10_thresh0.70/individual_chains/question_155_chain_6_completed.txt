Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z for a given state. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh right, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So our state is expressed in the P_z basis. That makes things a bit easier because it's already diagonal in that basis.

Let me write down the state vector ψ. So ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, its matrix is [[ħ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ħ]]. So each component of ψ corresponds to the respective eigenvalue of P_z.

To find ⟨P_z⟩, I calculate the expectation value. Since ψ is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where c_i are the components of ψ and λ_i are the eigenvalues of P_z.

Wait, the components of ψ are the coefficients in the basis. So for each component, multiply |c_i|² by the corresponding P_z eigenvalue.

Looking at ψ:

First component: -1/2. So |c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by ħ: (1/4) * ħ.

Second component: 1/√2. |c2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Multiply by 0 (since P_z here is zero), so no contribution.

Third component: -1/2. |c3|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by (-ħ): (1/4)*(-ħ).

So adding them up: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (1/4 (-ħ)) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now ⟨P_z²⟩: since P_z squared is the same as each eigenvalue squared, because it's diagonal. So the eigenvalues of P_z squared are (ħ)^2, 0, and ( -ħ )^2. Which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So again, compute the sum |c_i|² * (λ_i)^2.

So first term: (1/4) * (ħ)^2.

Second term: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third term: (1/4) * (ħ)^2.

Adding them up: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ². 

Now compute ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, that's just sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that would be the answer. Let me double-check: 

Yes, the calculation seems correct. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, and the variance is (1/2) ħ², so the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ, which is ħ / sqrt(2). So the correct answer should be option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ in the given basis is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since $\psi$ is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $c_i$ are the components of $\psi$ and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $\psi$ are:

- $c_1 = -\frac{1}{2} \implies |c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$,
- $c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \implies |c_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$,
- $c_3 = -\frac{1}{2} \implies |c_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\lambda_1 = \hbar$, $\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$:

\[
\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2, \quad \lambda_2^2 = 0, \quad \lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
