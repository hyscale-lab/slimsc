Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's read the problem again and see what's going on.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were then passed through three different tubes without cooling. The first tube had anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second was a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third had red-hot copper. 

The results are: tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams, tube 3 by 0.80 grams, and tube 2 didn't change. Also, after these reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure. The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, let's try to figure this out. First, I think I should figure out what each of these tubes does to the gases. The first tube with Mg(ClO4)2 is probably a drying agent because Mg(ClO4)2 is commonly used to absorb moisture. But wait, the tube's weight increased, so maybe it's reacting with something else. Oh, wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water vapor as it's a deliquescent. So, maybe the gas mixture contains water vapor. When it passes through Mg(ClO4)2, the water would be absorbed, increasing the tube's weight by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that there was 3.60 grams of water produced.

Then, the second tube is a Ca(OH)2 solution. Since the weight didn't change, perhaps the gas that came into contact with it didn't react. Wait, but Ca(OH)2 is in solution, which is a basic solution. If a gas passed through it and didn't cause a reaction, maybe the gas is inert under those conditions. Or perhaps the gas didn't dissolve or react with the base.

The third tube has red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So, the gas must have reacted with copper, oxidizing it. When copper is heated in a gas, it can react with certain gases. For example, CO would react with copper at high temperatures to form CO2. Wait, let me think: CO is a reducing agent. If you pass CO over hot copper, it would reduce CuO, but wait, in this case, the copper is getting oxidized. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2. No, wait, H2 would reduce CuO. Or perhaps the gas is a sulfur-containing gas? Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO2, but that doesn't react with copper. Hmm, what else could it be? Oh, maybe it's SO2. Wait, no, SO2 is a gas that can oxidize. Wait, but SO2 reacting with hot copper—does that happen? Alternatively
