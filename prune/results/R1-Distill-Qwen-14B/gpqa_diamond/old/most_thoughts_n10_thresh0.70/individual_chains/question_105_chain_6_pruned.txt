Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots that have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, and this looks like an exoplanet transit when observed photometrically. The question is, what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) compared to the star's radius (Rstar) to produce the same brightness variation amplitude?

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the signal in the light curve is the same as the variation caused by these spots.

Wait, but if the star wasn't covered by spots, the signal would be from a planet transiting. So the planet's transit would block some light, causing a dip. The spot-induced variation is due to spots rotating in and out of view, so when a spot is facing us, less light is emitted from that area, causing a dip, but as the star rotates, the spot moves away, the brightness increases again. But the problem says that the photometric variations due to spots can resemble an exoplanet. So we're comparing the amplitude of these two effects.

Wait, but the problem says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would give the same amplitude in the star's light curve. So, the observed amplitude from spots is the same as the amplitude from a planet transit. So, I need to calculate the amplitude due to the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about how the light variation from spots works. When a spot is on the visible hemisphere, it's cooler, so it emits less light. The star's total emitted flux will dip when the spot is visible. But since the spots are on only one hemisphere, the brightness variation would depend on the rotation period and the size of the spots.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So, each hemisphere is half the star's surface, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 *
