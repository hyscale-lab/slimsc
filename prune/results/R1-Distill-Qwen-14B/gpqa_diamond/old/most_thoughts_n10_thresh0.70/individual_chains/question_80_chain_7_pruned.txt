Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the value that the algorithm gives for the input ACAGTGACC. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down.

First, I'll look at the examples to see if I can find a pattern. Let's take the first one: AGG. So the output is 115. If I think about the letters in AGG, maybe each letter corresponds to a number. Let's list the letters and their positions in the alphabet. A is 1, G is 7, and another G is 7. So adding those up: 1 + 7 +7 = 15. But wait, the output is 115. That doesn't match. Maybe it's not just adding the individual letters.

Another thought: perhaps each pair of letters forms a two-digit number. AG is 1 and 7, so 17? Then GG is 7 and 7, which is 77. So 17 + 77? Wait, 17 +77 is 94, which isn't 115. Hmm, maybe that's not it either.

Wait, maybe each letter's numerical value is squared first. Let's try that. A is 1, so 1^2 is 1. G is 7, so 7^2 is 49. Another G is 49. So 1 +49+49= 99. Still not 115. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each pair of letters is multiplied. AG: 1*7=7. GG:7*7=49. Adding those: 7 +49=56. Not matching 115 again.

Wait, maybe each letter is converted to a number, and then the sum is multiplied by something. Let's see. For AGG, sum is 1+7+7=15. 15 times what is 115? 115 divided by 15 is approximately 7.666, which doesn't seem right. Maybe it's the product of the sum and another factor, but I'm not seeing it.

Let me check the second example to see if it can help. TGCTGA gives
