Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that means there's an ester functional group in the molecule. Esters typically have carbonyl groups (C=O) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. So the formula will have at least O2 because esters are usually like R-O-CO-O-R, wait no, wait. Wait, an ester is RCOOR', so the functional group is O and another O, but the formula for an ester is like that. So each ester group contributes two oxygen atoms. But wait, the compound has an ester group, which is one carbonyl and one ether-like linkage. So in the formula, O2 is present.

Looking at the options, all of them have O2, so that's consistent.

Now, the 1H NMR spectrum details are next. The spectrum shows six signals. Let me parse this:

- Two signals for aromatic-H: So the aromatic ring has two sets of protons. That suggests either para substitution (but wait, di-substituted. Di-substituted could be ortho, meta, or para. For a di-substituted benzene, the number of proton signals depends on substitution. For example, para substitution would give two equivalent protons, so one signal. But wait, if it's di-substituted, could it be that the ring has two different types of protons, so two signals? Like if the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two unique sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, no, wait. A di-substituted benzene can have either two substituents in the same position (like 1,1) but that's not possible for a six-membered ring. Wait, no, 1,1 would be a geminal di-substitution, which isn't common for benzene. So normally, di-substituted benzene is either ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).

If it's para, the ring would have two equivalent H environments. For example, if substituents
