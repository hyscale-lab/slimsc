Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

So the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. The state is provided as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll probably need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for this state.

Wait, but wait a second. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, right? So ⟨P_x⟩ would just be the eigenvalue. But we need the uncertainty in P_z, which is a different operator. So I can't assume that P_x and P_z commute. I think they don't, because generally in angular momentum, the components don't commute, so the uncertainties are related.

But maybe I should just proceed step by step. Let me first write down the given matrices.

The operator P_x matrix is:
Row 1: [0, ħ/√2, 0]
Row 2: [ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2]
Row 3: [0, ħ/√2, 0]

P_y matrix:
Row 1: [0, -i ħ/√2, 0]
Row 2: [i ħ/√2, 0, -i ħ/√2]
Row 3: [0, i ħ/√2, 0]

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That makes sense because P_z is diagonal in this basis, so each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. So the given state is expressed in this basis.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]

I think I'll need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for this state.

Wait, but wait. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is easy to compute.

Let me think: the eigenstates of P_z are the basis vectors here. So each component of ψ is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate. 

So for P_z, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. Let me index them as 1, 2, 3.

So ψ is a vector [a, b, c], where a is -1/2, b is 1/√2, c is -1/2.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is a^2 * ħ + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-ħ). Since when you compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, because P_z is diagonal, each component is (amplitude)^2 times the eigenvalue.

Wait, but wait, wait. That's correct, because the eigenstates are orthonormal. So each term in the expectation is |ψ_i|^2 times the eigenvalue.

So let me compute each term.

a = -1/2, so |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

c = -1/2, same as a, so |c|^2 = 1/4.

b = 1/√2, so |b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) * ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ
