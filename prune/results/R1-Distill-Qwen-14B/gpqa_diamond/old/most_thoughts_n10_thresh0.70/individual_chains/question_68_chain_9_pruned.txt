Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. They ask about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.

Hmm, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin by the gyromagnetic ratio gamma. So mu = gamma * S, but wait, the problem says mu = gamma * S_z. Wait, that might be a simplification because in reality, the magnetic dipole moment is proportional to the entire spin vector, but perhaps in this scenario, they're considering it along a specific direction. Or maybe it's just that the initial condition is along z, so mu is aligned with B in the z-direction.

The particle is in a magnetic field, so the magnetic moment will align with the field due to the Zeeman effect. Initially, the field is along +Z, so the energy levels are determined by the interaction between the magnetic moment and the field. The energy is given by E = -mu · B, right? So since mu is along z, E = -gamma S_z B.

But then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. So the new magnetic field is B in the Y direction. The magnetic moment will now interact with this Y-directed field.

Wait, but the problem says the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So I'm being asked about <mu_z> as a function of time, and its oscillation frequency.

I think the key here is to model the time evolution of the spin state under the new magnetic field. When the field switches from Z to Y, the Hamiltonian changes.

In the initial state, the field is along Z. So the particle's spin is in an eigenstate of S_z. Let me assume the particle was in the eigenstate |+z> with S_z = ħ/2. So the initial state is |+z>.

When the magnetic field is switched to Y direction, the new Hamiltonian H will be proportional to S_y. Because the energy is now E = -mu · B, and B is along Y, so E = -gamma B S_y. Wait, but wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the magnetic field is along Y, the magnetic moment's interaction would be with the Y component of the spin. So mu = gamma S, but perhaps the problem simplifies it to mu = gamma S_z for the initial condition, but when the field is along Y, the relevant term is S_y.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma S. So the interaction energy is E = -mu · B. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma S_z initially. Oh, maybe that's a specific case. Alternatively, perhaps mu is a vector, so mu = gamma S. So in general, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. But when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z. Therefore, the state |+z> is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in observable quantities.

The observable in question is the average of the z-component of the moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>, since mu = gamma S.

So I need to find d/dt <S_z> and see how it oscillates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the time evolution using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

The Hamiltonian after the field is switched is H = -gamma B S_y (since mu = gamma S, and B is along Y, so the dot product mu·B is gamma S_y B).

Wait, wait, perhaps the correct expression is H = - mu · B. So if mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, then H = - gamma B S_y.

Yes, that makes sense. So H = -gamma B S_y.

The initial state is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2. So the initial state is:

|psi(0)> = |+z> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)? Wait, no, |+z> is (0, 1) in the computational basis, and |down> is (1, 0). Wait, no, actually, |+z> is (1,0) in the S_z basis and |–z> is (0,1). Wait, no, wait: when we write spin-1/2 states, |+z> is (1,0), and |–z> is (0,1). So in the S_z basis, the states are |+z> and |-z>.

But when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, which can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, so H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H = - (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

The time evolution of the state is given by the time evolution operator U = exp(-i H t / ħ).

So H is proportional to sigma_y, so the time evolution will cause transitions between |+z> and |-z> states.

The state |psi(t)> = U |psi(0)>, right?

So let me compute U.

H = - (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

So H/ħ = - (gamma B / 2) sigma_y.

Thus, U = exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B / 2) sigma_y t ).

Expressed in terms of Pauli matrices, sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So sigma_y can be written as i times the Pauli matrix in the y-direction, but wait, I think it's better to write the exponential of sigma_y.

The exponential of i theta sigma_y can be expressed using Euler's formula for spin rotations. I remember that exp(i theta sigma_y / 2) represents a rotation about the y-axis by theta radians. But in this case, the exponent is (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y. So let me factor that.

Wait, U = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

So this is similar to a rotation around the y-axis by an angle theta = gamma B t.

Wait, more precisely, the time evolution operator for spin systems can be written using rotation operators. The general formula is that exp( -i phi S_j / ħ ) is the rotation operator around axis j by angle phi.

In this case, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the time evolution is a rotation about the y-axis.

So the time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y ), since H = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ) sigma_y.

Wait, the general form is exp( -i (H t) / ħ ), which in this case is exp( i gamma B t sigma_y / 2 ), because H = - (gamma B ħ/2 ) sigma_y, so H t/ħ is - (gamma B t / 2 ) sigma_y.

So U becomes exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y ).

Expressed in matrix form, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the exponential becomes a matrix. Alternatively, we can compute it
