Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. They've given some elemental abundance data using the EW method, and some solar photosphere composition. Hmm, right, the EW method refers to equivalent width, which is a way to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere by measuring the strength of spectral lines. 

Let's jot down the given data:

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Sun's photosphere:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, but we need silicon in the stars. Oh right, because the question is about the ratio [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], I think.

So, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So, [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or the other way around? Wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so it's Star_1's Si over Star_2's Si.

But to find that, I'll need to find [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio of those two.

Wait, but we have [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], which can help us find [Si/H]. Similarly for Star_2, we have [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H], which can lead us to [Si/H].

So let's break it down.

First, for Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So, [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun.

Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of Fe abundance in the star to that in the Sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 = 0, then the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun.

So, nFe,1 / nH,1 = nFe,sun / nH,sun.

From the sun's data:

nFe/sun = 1e^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Wait,
