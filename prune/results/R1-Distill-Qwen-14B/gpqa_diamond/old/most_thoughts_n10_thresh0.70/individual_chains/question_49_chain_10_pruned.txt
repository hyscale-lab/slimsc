Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, C, each being a reaction that I need to complete. Then I need to match the products with the given options A, B, C, D.

First, the problem statement says that sigmatropic rearrangements are pericyclic reactions where the terminal pi bond moves into a sigma bond. Cope and Claisen are examples, and these reactions are thermodynamically favored. So for each reaction, I should probably think about what kind of sigmatropic rearrangement is happening.

Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ + Heat â†’ A

Hmm. Let's draw the structures. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CHNH2. But-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOH with a double bond between C2 and C3, so structure like CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, butene is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no. The double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but buten has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that can't be right because but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which isn't possible for butene because it only has four carbons. Oh wait, that's not possible. So but-3-en-2-ol must be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Let me number: the four carbons are 1,2,3,4. So the double bond is between 3 and 4? No, that would make it but-3-en-1-ol or something else. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH2 with a double bond elsewhere. Maybe it's CH2=CHCH2OH, but that would be but-2-en-3-ol. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the actual structure. Alternatively, perhaps the but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have the hydroxyl on C2, and the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, that would be four carbons. So carbon 2 has the OH, carbon 3 and
