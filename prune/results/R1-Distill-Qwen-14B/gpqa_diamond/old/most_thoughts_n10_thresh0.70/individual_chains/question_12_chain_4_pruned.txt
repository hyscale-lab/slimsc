Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about particle physics and kinetic energy. Hmm, the question is about the production of a muon and a neutrino when a pion is at rest. Oh wait, the reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. And the pion is stationary. I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and so are muons and neutrinos. 

The given data is the rest masses: the Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino? Oh, right, neutrinos are super light. I think in these kinds of problems, their rest mass is considered negligible. So we can treat the neutrino as massless for this calculation. That might make things easier.

The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles, the muon and the neutrino. The options are given, so I need to figure out which pair is correct. 

Let me think about the conservation laws here. Since the pion is stationary initially, the total momentum before the decay is zero. That means the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. So the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Wait, but the neutrino is massless, so its energy is all kinetic, right? Because for massless particles, E = pc. For the
