Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is about 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], and we're given Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is, how many revolutions does the proton make?

Hmm, I remember that in cyclotrons and similar devices, the particles are accelerated by an alternating voltage. The number of revolutions depends on the time they spend in the accelerator and their orbital frequency.

Wait, but I need to think about the specifics of synchrocyclotrons. Synchrocyclotrons are similar to cyclotrons but they have a varying magnetic field, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, in cyclotrons, the magnetic field is constant, but the frequency of the accelerating voltage is adjusted as the particle's velocity increases. Synchrocyclotrons might have a fixed frequency, but I'm a bit confused. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should look that up in my notes, but since I can't, I'll proceed carefully.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the proton is accelerated twice. Wait, the question says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh, perhaps each time it goes around the orbit, it gets a push from the electric field. So each revolution, it gains some energy. But I'm not entirely sure.

So the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(...), which suggests that the electric field is sinusoidal. The number of revolutions depends on the time it takes to reach the final energy, and how many times it circles the synchrocyclotron during that time.

Let me think about the process. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, so initial velocity v ≈ 0. The voltage is applied, and each time the proton completes a half-cycle of the voltage, it gains some energy. Because the electric field accelerates the proton when the voltage is in the correct phase.

Wait, in cyclotrons, the frequency of the accelerating voltage is matched to the particle's cyclotron frequency. The cyclotron frequency is ω = qB/(m), where B is the magnetic field. But in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field might vary, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the key here is to find how much energy the proton gains per revolution and then determine how many revolutions are needed to reach 950 MeV.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, each time the particle completes a half-orbit, it gets a kick from the electric field. So each full revolution (half cycle of the voltage?) adds a certain amount of energy. But I'm not sure if each revolution adds the same energy. Because as the proton's speed increases,
