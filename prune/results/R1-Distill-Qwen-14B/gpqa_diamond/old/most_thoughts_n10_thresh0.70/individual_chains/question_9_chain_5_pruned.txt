Okay, so I've got this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry stuff, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves various types like Cn, Dn, Td, Oh, etc. C3h symmetry specifically refers to a trigonal planar symmetry with a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, actually, I should double-check what C3h means. I think C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. I remember from my notes that C3h is a point group. Point groups are classifications based on symmetry elements.

So the options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo-trifuran-something, and another triphenyleno-trifuran.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate structure: I think it's a boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. Each isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2 group. Since each substituent is the same, the molecule should have a certain symmetry. But wait, when all three substituents are identical, the molecule would have a C3 axis, right? Because each substituent is the same, so rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But what about the mirror planes? If it's a trigonal planar arrangement, then there might be a horizontal mirror plane. So maybe C3h symmetry applies here. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if all substituents are same and arranged symmetrically, maybe it has D3h symmetry, which is higher than C3h. Wait, what's the difference between C3h and D3h? D3h would have a C3 axis plus three mirror planes, whereas C3h has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane but no other mirror planes. So maybe triisopropyl borate has higher symmetry, like D3h, not C3h. So perhaps it's not the correct answer.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure. Its structure looks like a cube with a bridge; I think it has a four-membered bridge. Wait, no, wait. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[
