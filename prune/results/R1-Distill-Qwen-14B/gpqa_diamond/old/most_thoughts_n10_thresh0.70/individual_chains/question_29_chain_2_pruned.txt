Okay, so I've got this question about barley and some gene mutation. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, the situation is that there's this barley cultivar that's drought-resistant, which is good, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. That compound makes it unusable for food, so they want to get rid of it. They found the gene responsible for making that compound. The gene has five exons and four introns.

They did EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a type of chemical mutagen that causes point mutations. So EMS stands for ethyl methanesulfonate, right? It's an alkylating agent that mainly causes base substitutions, especially in regions where replication is active. So it's used to create random mutations in genes to study their effects.

They sequenced the target gene in all the mutants and found some changes in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think that would mean the gene isn't functional anymore, so the compound isn't produced. So probably, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function—like a loss-of-function mutation.

Looking at the given sequences, the intact gene is provided, and the mutants have some changes in the beginning of the sequence (first exon). Let's look at each mutant.

The intact gene sequence starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, let's compare. The first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGAT... Wait, let me line them up.

Original: positions 1-20 or so. Let me count letters.

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT...

Wait, maybe it's better to look for where the differences are. So the original has maybe after ATG:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 1: TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT...

Hmm. Let me compare each part. Let me count the letters. Let's suppose each group is 3 nucleotides (codon). So the first codon is ATG (same in all), then TTT, then CTC in original, but in mutant1 it's CTA.

Wait, the first difference is in the third codon. Original third codon is CTC (which is arginine), mutant1 is CTA (also arginine, same as the original? Wait, CTA is leucine? No, wait,
