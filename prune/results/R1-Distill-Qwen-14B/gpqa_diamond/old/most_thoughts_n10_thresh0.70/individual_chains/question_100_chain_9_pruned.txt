Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, I'm thinking that could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but wait, propene would be C3H6, right? Because propene is CH2=CHCH3, so yes, that's C3H6. Alternatively, cyclopropane is C3H6 too, but I think propene is more likely because it's more reactive for the next step.

So, A is C3H6. Then, it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, wait, I remember that when alkenes react with bromine (Br2), they undergo addition reactions. Since propene is an alkene, adding Br2 would form dibromopropane. So, compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Or wait, maybe it's 1,1-dibromopropane? No, I think for propene, adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this sounds like an elimination reaction. The dibromide would lose HBr in an E2 mechanism. So, probably removing two HBr molecules to form an alkene. Which alkene? Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when KOH is removed, the possible alkenes would be propene (if we dehydrohalogenate from each Br), but wait, which position?

Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane would have Br on C1 and C2. When KOH (alcohol) is added, it's an E2 elimination. So, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, and the Br would leave. Since both Brs are on adjacent carbons, the elimination could lead to forming either 1-propene or 2-propene. But wait, 1-propene is just propene, and 2-propene is also propene. Wait, no—propene is CH2=CHCH3. If we have 1,2
