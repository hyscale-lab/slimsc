Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Hmm, wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Oh, right, because di-substituted means two substituents, each taking up a position on the ring. So each substituent must be something that adds a certain number of carbons. Let me think, if the ring is 6 carbons and the substituents add 2, that makes 8 total.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So the substituents on the benzene ring are likely a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, wait. Each substituent is probably one group. So maybe the two substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen (like -Cl or -Br). But wait, wait a second, that can't be because substituents are each a single group. Let me think again. Oh wait, di-substituted means two substituent groups attached to the benzene ring, each substituent can be multiple carbons.

Wait, but the total number of carbons in the compound is 8. Benzene is 6 carbons, so substituents add 2 carbons in total. So both substituents together contribute 2 carbons.

Wait, but substituents are usually groups attached to the ring. So if each substituent is a single atom (like Cl or Br), then they don't contribute any carbons. But the carbonyl group might be part of a larger substituent. Hmm, maybe each substituent is a group that includes a carbon.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), and the other is a halogen. Let me think about that.

Wait, but the benzene ring can't have just a carbonyl group attached, because that would be a substituent like -CO-R. Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other
