Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about electrons and their angular momentum. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So, each electron must have an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1 because p orbitals correspond to l=1. The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that's the coupled angular momentum state for the two-electron system. So, l is the total orbital angular momentum, which is 2 here, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. They want the joint probability of both measurements giving eigenvalues of -ħ. So, each electron's Lz component would be -ħ when measured.

Wait, each L_z eigenvalue for an electron in an orbital state is mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. Since each electron is in a p orbital, their individual m values can be -1, 0, or +1. So each L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this state combines the two individual angular momenta. The way these states combine is through the addition of angular momentum. For two particles, the total angular momentum quantum number L is the sum of l1 and l2, or any possible value from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2.

Wait, but in this case, l1 and l2 are both 1, so possible L values are 0, 1, or 2. Since the total state here has L=2, we're looking at the maximum possible value.

Now, the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of the total L² and Lz. So when we measure Lz_total, we get mħ, which is -1 here, so -ħ.

But the question is about the individual L1z and L2z measurements. So, when you measure L1z, you get m1ħ, and L2z gives m2ħ. The joint probability is the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1, so that L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ.

Wait, but
