Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos, since they move at near light speed) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So whatever happens in the core would only affect us after that time has passed. But the question is about the flux of neutrinos reaching Earth now, so 8.5 minutes after the pp-III stopped.

I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through proton-proton fusion. There are different branches. The pp-I, II, III branches... wait, pp-III is one of the main branches responsible for producing helium-4. Oh right, the pp-I branch produces two positrons and two neutrinos, and the pp-III branch is a later step where two protons combine with a helium-2 (He-2) ion, or something like that. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the details.

Wait, the main branches of the proton-proton chain: the pp-I branch is the initial reaction where two protons collide to form a deuterium nucleus, a positron, and a neutrino. Then, the pp-II branch is when a deuterium nucleus fuses with another proton to form tritium, etc. And the pp-III branch produces He-4. Or wait, maybe the pp-III is the main reaction that produces He-4, which is the dominant process in the Sun. Or perhaps the pp-III is a side branch. I'm a bit confused, but I think pp-III is the dominant pathway in the Sun, especially since the Sun is not very massive, so the pp chain is the main fusion process.

So, what's the flux of neutrinos from the Sun? Well, the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp chain, particularly from the pp-I branch, which produces electron neutrinos. But wait, the pp-III branch might also produce neutrinos. Or maybe the neutrinos in the pp chain are from the pp-I branch, which is the first step. Because in the pp-I reaction, two protons collide to form deuterium, a positron, and a neutrino. So each of these reactions emits a neutrino. So the flux of neutrinos is mainly from the pp-I reactions, right?

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stops. So, what's the impact on the neutrino flux? If pp-III stops, does that affect the production of neutrinos? Or is the neutrino emission from a different part of the chain?

Wait, so the pp chain has several steps. The initial step (pp-I) produces a neutrino. Then, in the pp-II branch, a deuterium nucleus captures a proton to form tritium, which then undergoes beta decay to helium-3. Then, when two He-3 nuclei collide, they form He-4, releasing energy. Alternatively, one He-3 could capture a proton to form
