Okay, so I have this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation states of atoms depend on the temperature and the energy levels.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. Oh wait, the ratio is 2:1 for star_1 to star_2. 

I think the Boltzmann equation is relevant here. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels. The equation is something like:

n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - (ΔE) / (k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars, which I guess they are since it's the same element in different stars, then the ratio of excitation would depend on the exponential term.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, 1.38 is also Boltzmann's constant. So that's interesting. Let me write that down.

Given that, the ratio of excitation in star_1 (n1) to star_2 (n2) is 2:1. So,

n1 / n2 = 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Because the g factors are the same, they cancel out.

Let me simplify the exponents. So,

2 = exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) )

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract them. So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] * (-1) ?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The ratio is n1/n2 = 2. So,

n1/n2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is same as exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Hmm, but wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. And Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE = k. That's neat.

So substituting ΔE = k,

ln(2) = (k) / (k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the signs. Because the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is negative for each term. So,

n1/n2 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because,

exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ) = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which when ΔE = k,

= exp( (1)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So yes, ln(2) equals (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, but that gives ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1), which can be rearranged as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches what we have.

Wait, let me check the math again. Because when you have 1/T2 - 1/T1, that's equal to (T1 - T2)/ (T1 T2). So yes, because:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So, the equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which is exactly what we derived.

So the correct answer must be D.


The problem involves two stars where the excitation of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice that of star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches Boltzmann's constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Under the assumption of LTE, the Boltzmann equation relates the excitation levels to the temperature:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

Since the statistical weights \( g \) are assumed to be the same for both stars, the ratio of excitation levels simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Given that \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} = 2 \), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: D
