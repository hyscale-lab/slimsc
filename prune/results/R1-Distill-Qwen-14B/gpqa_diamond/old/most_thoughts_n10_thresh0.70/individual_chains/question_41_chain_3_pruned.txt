Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to work through it.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh, and c is given as 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the glass is moving toward us, and the light is moving in that direction too. Hmm, does that affect how we see the speed of the light?

I remember something about the speed of light in different media. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index. So in this case, the speed would be v_light = c/n = 1/n since c is 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. So we have to consider the motion of the medium relative to the observer. I think this is a case of adding velocities, but I'm not sure. Because normally, when you have a medium moving, the speed of light in the medium would change based on the relative motion.

Wait, no. Let me think. The speed of light in the medium is always c/n from the medium's frame. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

I recall that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linear
