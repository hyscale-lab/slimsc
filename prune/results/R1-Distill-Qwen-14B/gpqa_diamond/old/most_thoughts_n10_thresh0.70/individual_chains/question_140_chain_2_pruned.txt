Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the details, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B has a melting point very close to 277 K. Another clue is that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog is known for that.

Hmm. Let me try to figure this out.

First, the gas W: same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must have equal neutrons and protons. Wait, protons are in the nucleus, neutrons too. So each atom in W's molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. Or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal numbers? The wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the molecule of gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think of possible gases. CO2 has 24 neutrons in each molecule (assuming C is 12, O is 16 each) and protons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 16*2 = 38 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 8 each from O (each O has 8 neutrons if it's ^16O, so 8*2=16). So 6 + 16 =22. But 38 protons vs 22 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait another thought: maybe W is a molecule where each atom in the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Like, for example, H2O.
