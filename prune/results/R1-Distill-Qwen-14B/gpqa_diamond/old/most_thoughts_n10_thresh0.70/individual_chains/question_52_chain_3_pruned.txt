Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in different energy levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation.

So, let's see what the problem says. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, does that mean that the spots are making the star cooler overall? Because spots are darker, they absorb less light, so the star appears dimmer, right? But how does that affect the effective temperature?

Wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the star's overall energy output. So when spots cover part of the surface, the total emitted flux would decrease? Oh, because the spots are cooler, their contribution is less. So the star's overall Teff would decrease. That makes sense with the given data: from 6000K to 5500K when 40% is covered.

But wait, the problem says that when the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000K
