Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory where you write down all possible operators (built from the Standard Model fields) up to a certain dimension, beyond the renormalizable ones. These operators are organized by their dimension.

Now, each operator must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has certain fundamental symmetries. But which ones must all operators in SMEFT respect?

Lorentz symmetry is one. Because the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and any effective theory should preserve that. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected. But wait, how about Poincare symmetry?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in a general effective field theory, you might have operators that don't respect translations? Like, for example, operators with higher derivatives can lead to non-local effects, but wait, SMEFT is constructed as a local effective theory. So Poincare symmetry would include momentum conservation and so on. So I think SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry as well. So 2 is also required.

So 1 and 2 are both respected. Now, what about CP and CPT?

CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model is almost CP symmetric except for some parts, like certain Yukawa couplings. But wait, does SMEFT respect CP? Because when you write the SMEFT operators, they usually include all possible terms, including those that might violate CP. However, the question is about what must be respected by all operators. Or is it that the theory must respect these symmetries?

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators must be written in such a way that they don't explicitly break certain symmetries. But wait, I think the SMEFT includes operators that can violate certain symmetries, but the operators themselves are written in a way that respects the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model.

Wait, no, perhaps SMEFT is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So, the SM has some symmetry, and the SMEFT must respect those, but perhaps not necessarily others
