Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I think this involves some kind of rearrangement reaction. 

First, I need to draw the structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me visualize it. Nona means nine carbons in total. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, so the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃? Wait, no, that's not considering the substituent correctly. Wait, it's 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Oh, wait, the substituent is a butyl group at position 5. So the main chain has nine carbons, and on the fifth carbon, there's a butyl group attached.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The main chain is nine carbons long, and the substituent is a butyl group attached to the fifth carbon. But wait, butyl is four carbons, right? So the structure would be something like CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait another approach: Nona-2,6-diene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH
