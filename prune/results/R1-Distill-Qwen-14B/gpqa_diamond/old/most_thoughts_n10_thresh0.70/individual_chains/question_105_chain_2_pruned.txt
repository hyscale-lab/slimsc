Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness. Then it's comparing that to a situation where an exoplanet would cause similar brightness variations.

The star has the same radius as the Sun. Wait, radius Rstar = Sun's radius. So Rstar is known, but I don't have the exact number, but maybe I don't need it because I'm dealing with ratios.

The star's hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Oh right, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So 20% of one hemisphere is spots. Wait, but each hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2). Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, the star is a sphere, so a hemisphere is half the surface area. So the filling factor is 20% of that. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (4π Rstar² / 2) )? Wait wait, maybe I should think of it as the spots covering 20% of the entire star's surface. Oh wait no, no. The question says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So one hemisphere is covered 20% in spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (
