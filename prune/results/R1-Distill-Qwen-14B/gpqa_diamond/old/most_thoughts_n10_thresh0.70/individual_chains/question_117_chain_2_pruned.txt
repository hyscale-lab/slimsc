Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the molecule isn't symmetrical and can't be superimposed on its mirror image. So the question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit this property.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, that's a mouthful. So it's a biphenyl structure, two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 2' positions, and at 6 and 6', but also there are two nitro groups and two carboxylate ester groups. Oh, and the substituents are ortho to each other maybe? Wait, no: positions 2, 2', 6, 6'â€”so on each benzene ring, at positions 2 and 6, there are substituents. But the substituents are on the same ring in the 6,6' positions as well. Hmm. Wait, what's the structure? Well, if the biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1', then the other substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So in each benzene ring, the substituents are at opposite positions. Now, does that mean the molecule is symmetrical? Because if each ring has substituents opposite each other, perhaps the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, but the substituents are on both rings. Let me try to visualize. The two benzene rings are connected in a way that each has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions, but I'm not sure about the arrangement. Oh, wait,
