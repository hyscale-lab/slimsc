Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this NMR and LC-MS question. Let's take it step by step. So, the scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right, but there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. They have similar shifts, their integrals add up to 1H, and the coupling pattern isn't causing this duplication. So spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Then, looking at the LC-MS of the crude compound at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity, and both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. So the mass is the same, meaning same molecular weight, but the LC is separating them. Hmm.

Let me think about what each of these observations could mean.

First, the NMR issue: duplicate peaks for the same proton. Since coupling is ruled out, maybe it's something else. One possibility is that there are two different environments for the same proton. Wait, but how? If the molecule is a racemic mixture, then each enantiomer would have protons in slightly different environments. But wait, alpha protons are on a chiral center. So in an enantiomer, the environment would be mirrored. So for an alpha proton in an enantiomer, would the environment be different enough to cause a split in the NMR?

Wait, but in an enantiomer, the structure is mirrored. If the alpha proton is on a chiral center, in each enantiomer, the neighboring groups are arranged differently. So the chemical shift would be slightly different. But wait, in the NMR, the two peaks have similar shifts. So if the two enantiomers were present, would their alpha protons have similar but not identical shifts? Also, an enantiomer would have the same number of protons, so the integral would be 2H if both are present, but the question says together they integrate to 1H. Oh wait, no, the problem says the two peaks together integrate to 1H. So each peak is integrating for about 0.5H? Because the same proton is being split into two, each with integral 0.5 and together 1H.

Wait, but enantiomers would have the same number of protons, so the integrals would add up to 2H? No, wait. If the molecule is a racemic mixture (50:50), then each enantiomer has the same number of protons. So for a single proton, each enantiomer contributes one, so together we'd see 2H. That's not matching the NMR data here, which says the two peaks together integrate to 1H. So that's a problem. So if it were enantiomers, the integral would be 2H, but the question says 1H. So maybe it's not about enantiomers.

Another possibility is diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. If the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers, each would have a different environment for the alpha proton. So each diastere
