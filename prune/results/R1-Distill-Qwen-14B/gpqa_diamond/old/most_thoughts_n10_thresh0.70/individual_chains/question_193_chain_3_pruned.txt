Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So like, if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller. The formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. Or wait, maybe it's plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. Right, so d = 1/plx.

The problem says the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. So N ~ 1/(plx)^5. But since d = 1/plx, that would mean plx = 1/d. Substituting that into the equation, N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N ~ d^5.

But the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, I think this is about the differential number of stars. Like, how many stars are there in a small slice of space at a certain distance. So it's about the number density as a function of distance.

Wait, I remember that in the galaxy, the number of stars isn't uniform. At a certain distance, more stars might be present because of the structure of the galaxy. But in this problem, it's a specific region where N varies as 1/plx^5. So since N is proportional to d^5, how does the number change as you go to larger distances?

Wait, but wait. Actually, when considering the number of stars per unit volume, it's related to how they're distributed. If more stars are found at a certain distance, that affects the density. But perhaps we're considering the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr. So the number would be proportional to something like the surface area times the thickness, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can model it as a function of distance. If N ∝ d^5, then when you look at the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr, the number would be proportional to d^5 times something else. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about it again. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is (d)^5. So N increases rapidly with distance. But the question is about how N changes per unit distance. So if I have dr as a unit of distance, how does N(r) change when r increases by dr?

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit volume. But volume is in three dimensions. So the number of stars in a volume element dV would be something like N = k * d^5, where k is a constant. But dV is 4πr² dr, so in that case, the number of stars per unit volume (
