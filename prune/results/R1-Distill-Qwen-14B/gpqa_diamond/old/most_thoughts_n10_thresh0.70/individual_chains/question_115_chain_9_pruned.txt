Alright, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, right. So first, I should probably think about conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Let's consider the rest frame or the center of momentum frame maybe.

Wait, but since the particles are annihilating into photons, perhaps it's better to look at the total energy and momentum before the collision.

Electron and positron are each other's antiparticles, so when they annihilate, they produce photons. Each has a rest mass of m_e (electron mass), so their rest energies are the same.

Wait, but their Lorentz factors are different. So their energies and momenta will vary.

Let me think about each particle's energy and momentum.

The Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = total energy / rest energy. So for the electron, γ_e =4, so its total energy E_e = γ_e * m_e c². Similarly, the positron has γ_p =2, so E_p = γ_p * m_e c².

But wait, the positron is moving to the right, so its momentum direction is opposite to the electron's.

Electron's velocity is to the right (from left), so its momentum is to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so its momentum is to the left? Wait, wait, no. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis but from the right. So if the electron is moving from the left, direction is positive, then the positron is moving in the opposite direction—so their momenta are in opposite directions.

So the total momentum before collision is the sum of the two momenta.

Let's compute their momenta. For a relativistic particle, momentum p = γ m v.

But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, perhaps it
