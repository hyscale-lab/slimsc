Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and the radiation they emit. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can produce electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the maximum power radiated and the fraction at a specific angle.

Alright, let's break it down. The setup is a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating, so it's symmetric around the z-axis. When it radiates, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta (the angle from the z-axis). The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also a possible form of f.

Wait, what's the radiation pattern like for such a source? I think for a dipole antenna, the radiation is maximum along the equator, perpendicular to the axis, right? So the dipole's radiation pattern is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and it falls off as cos(theta) or something like that.

But wait, this is an oscillating charge distribution. If it's spheroid-shaped, maybe it's an electric quadrupole or something else. But wait, no, the main source of radiation is probably a dipole term, especially if it's oscillating along the z-axis. So the dipole radiation pattern would be something like (sin(theta))^2 or similar.

Wait, the radiation from a dipole is proportional to (sin theta)^2. Because for a dipole, the radiation is maximum at 90 degrees, and falls to zero at 0 and 180 degrees. So the power pattern would have a maximum at 90 and minimum at 0 and 180.

But the problem isn't about the dipole exactly, but an oscillating charge distribution which is spheroidal. Hmm. Maybe it's a dipole-like radiation, though. Alternatively, it could
