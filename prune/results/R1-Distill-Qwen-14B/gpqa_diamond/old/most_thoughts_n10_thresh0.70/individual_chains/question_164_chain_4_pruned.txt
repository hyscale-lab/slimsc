Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, the radial velocity (RV) variations in system_1 have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the RV method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The idea is that each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so its RV variation would be smaller. The less massive star moves more, so larger RV amplitude.

Wait, right, the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitudes. So, if star A has velocity v_A and star B has v_B, their mass ratio is M_A/M_B = v_B / v_A. Because M1*v1 = M2*v2, since the center of mass stays fixed.

So, for system_1: the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say the stars are A and B. So v_A =10, v_B=5. So their mass ratio M_A/M_B = v_B / v_A = 5/10 = 0.5. So M_A : M_B = 1:2. So the total mass for system_1 is M1 = M_A + M_B = 1 + 2 = 3 units.

Similarly, system_2 has RVs of 15 and 10 km/s. So v_A=15, v_B=10. So mass ratio M_A/M_B = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666. So the masses are in a ratio of 2:3. So the total mass M2 = 2 +3 =5 units.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the velocity amplitude the same as the actual velocity? Because the RV curves are sinusoidal, the amplitude is the maximum velocity. So the velocities are indeed v1 and v2 for each star.

But the period is the same as the orbital period, right? Because the period between eclipses is the same as the orbital period. Because eclipses occur when one star passes in front of the other, so the orbital period is the time between such events.

So, the orbital period is P for each system. For system_1, P is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year.

Now, I think the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the velocities, the period, and the masses. Or maybe Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law in the context of binary systems says that (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars.

But wait, another approach: since the velocities are given, maybe I can find the mass function.

The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by f(M) = (v1^3 * P) / (2π G). But I'm not sure if I'm remembering that correctly. Alternatively, I think the mass function is f(M) = (M2³ sin³i)/( (M1 + M2)² ), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But since both systems are eclipsing, their orbits are edge-on, so sin i =1.

Wait, but each system's RV gives information about the masses. Let me think again.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit the center of mass. So the velocity amplitudes (v1 and v2) are inversely proportional to their masses. So, M1/M2 = v2/v1. Which is what I had earlier.

So for system_1: M1 = 10 km/s, M2=5 km/s. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half of M2. So M1 = 0.5 * M2, and total mass is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify variables. Let me denote the stars as Star A and Star B in each system.

In system_1:
v_A =10 km/s
v_B=5 km/s

Their mass ratio is M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A = 5/10 = 0
