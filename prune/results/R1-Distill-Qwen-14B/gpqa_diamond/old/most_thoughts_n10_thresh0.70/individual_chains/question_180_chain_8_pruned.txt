Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, let's break it down.

The question says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that, so 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, wait, I should remember that e is approximately 1.6 Ã—10^-19 C, so 2e would be 3.2e-19 C each.

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so point P is where the 13th charge is located. The 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the 13th is at P, and the others are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m around P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions.

Wait, but wait, the system is isolated. So that's important because it means no external fields are influencing the charges except their own.

So I need to calculate the total electric potential energy of this
