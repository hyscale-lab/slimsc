Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

First, the state is given as |ψ> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, so non-Gaussianity is measured using relative entropy. The formula given is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Oh right, rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So the non-Gaussianity is the difference in their entropies.

But wait, how is this calculated? I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian.

But wait, the relative entropy uses the reference Gaussian state. How do I find tau? Or is there a standard reference state for this calculation? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state. Not
