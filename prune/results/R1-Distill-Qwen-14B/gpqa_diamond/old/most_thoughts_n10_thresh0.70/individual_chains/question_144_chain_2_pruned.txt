Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all around 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so I'm guessing it's a very small distance, which makes sense for particles decaying quickly.

Wait, mean decay distance. I think that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, to find that, I probably need to find the lifetime first and then multiply by the speed, right?

But how do I find the lifetime? I remember that the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is roughly ħ (Planck's constant over 2π). So, Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, and I need to convert that into units compatible with ħ. Because ħ is usually in units like eV·s or something like that. Oh wait, ħc is sometimes used in these calculations, but maybe I can work it out in natural units first and then convert.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula for the mean proper lifetime τ being given by τ = ℏ / Γ. So, if I compute that, I get the lifetime in seconds. Then, I multiply τ by the speed of the meson to get the decay distance.

But wait, the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV. So, I can't just use the speed of light, I need to calculate its velocity based on its energy. Because particles at relativistic speeds have speeds close to c, but I can't assume c exactly.

So, let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the lifetime τ
