Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts are given as δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. We ignore the rest of the phase shifts. We need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are all in fm, which I think stands for femtometers, 10^-15 meters.

Hmm, right. I remember from my studies that scattering amplitude in quantum mechanics is related to the phase shifts. The scattering amplitude f(θ, ω) can be written in terms of the partial waves. The general formula I recall is:

f(θ, ω) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ ( (δ_l - iπ/2) e^{iδ_l} - 1 ) * (2l + 1) Pl(cosθ) ]

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula. Let me think again. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f is given by the sum over all angular momentum states l. Each term contributes a factor involving the phase shift δ_l and the spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials.

Alternatively, the scattering amplitude can be expressed as:

f(θ, ω) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ) * (2l + 1) Pl(cosθ)

Wait, perhaps that's more accurate. Alternatively, some sources use f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l+1) P_l (cosθ) ].

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another way I've seen it is that the scattering amplitude is proportional to the sum of the partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term involving e^{iδ_l} and the Legendre polynomial.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude in the case of elastic scattering is often dominated by the lowest few phase shifts, especially for small angles. The question specifically asks about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which would be θ=0 degrees. So maybe I don't need to compute the full sum, but only consider the terms that contribute at
