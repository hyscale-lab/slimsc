Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product of the state with the operator applied. So, the formula is ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator in question. In this case, the operator is S_y.

Wait, but wait, I should probably start by recalling what the spin states look like for an electron. Oh right, the spin states can be represented as two-component vectors. The given state here is (3i, 4). I think that means the spinor is (3i, 4) in a two-dimensional complex vector space.

Now, S_y is the spin angular momentum operator in the y-direction. I remember that for an electron, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and each multiplied by ħ/2 gives the corresponding spin operator. So, σ_y is given as:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i,  0]]

So, S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The state ψ is given as (3i, 4). I should write that as a column vector. So ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated as ψ† (S_y) ψ. Let me break that down.

Wait, no, wait. Because S_y is an operator, and ψ is a column vector. So the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

But wait, S_y is a 2x2 matrix, and ψ is a 2x1 column vector. So first, S_y * ψ would be a 2x1 vector, then
