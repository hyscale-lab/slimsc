Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit puzzled. The question is about identifying which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules relates to their point groups, right? So, C3h symmetry refers to a certain type of symmetry that includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Let me think again.

I think the C3h point group has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that's perpendicular to that axis. So the molecule must have that kind of symmetry. But I'm a bit shaky on the specifics, so I should probably review what each point group entails.

The question provides four options, each a different molecule. Let's list them:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I need to figure out which one of these has C3h symmetry.

First, let me think about each molecule's structure.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate is a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. Its structure is something like B with three (i-Pr) groups. Wait, but the structure—does it have any symmetry? I think isopropyl groups are bulky. Let me visualize the molecule. Boron is at the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2 group. So the molecule is trigonal planar around boron, right? Wait, but each group is the same, so it has a three-fold rotation axis. So the molecule should have C3 symmetry. But what about a mirror plane? If it's a planar structure, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, in triisopropylborane, each isopropyl is the same, so it's symmetric. So the point group would be Td? Or maybe D3h? Wait, I'm getting confused. Because if it's trigonal planar with all three substituents the same, maybe it's D3h. Because D3h has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm. So if triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, then it would have C3h symmetry as part of that. Wait, but D3h is a higher symmetry group. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would be in C3h, but D3h has more elements, including vertical mirrors and others. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Because each isopropyl group is identical, but perhaps the molecule's structure doesn't have a plane that reflects across. Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. Maybe I
