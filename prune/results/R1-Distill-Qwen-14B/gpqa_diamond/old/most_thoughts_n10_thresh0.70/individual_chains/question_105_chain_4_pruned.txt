Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes periodically. The situation looks similar to an exoplanet causing brightness variations, but the question is asking: if instead, there was an exoplanet causing the same amplitude in brightness, what would its radius be relative to the host star?

So, the options are A to D, with some decimal numbers. I think I need to calculate the ratio Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

First, I remember that the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting a star (like in the transit method) depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is delta F = (Rpl / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this problem, the star has spots. The spots are cooler and cover part of the star. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and affect the observed brightness. I need to model this effect and then compare it to the effect of a planet.

Let me break it down. The star without spots has a certain flux. The spots have lower flux. When the star rotates, the spots rotate into and out of our view, causing the total flux to vary.

The filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of the star's hemisphere that's facing us. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) because a hemisphere is half the star's surface.

But wait, when the star rotates, the spot area visible changes. Hmm, maybe I should model the brightness variation due to the spots as the star rotates.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation compared to a planet's transit. So I need to find what Rpl
