Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics impose certain conditions on the quantum numbers of the final NN state. The condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to determine which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A, B, C, D, each representing a possible transition with different orbital angular momentum states for the emitted particle X.

Hmm. I remember that in particle physics, when particles are identical bosons, their total wavefunction must be symmetric under exchange. The Pauli exclusion principle comes into play here, which affects the overall symmetry of the state.

The initial state is 1S0. So, breaking that down, the 1S0 notation is (2S+1)L(J). Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For atomic orbitals, the term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. But here, it's a two-nucleon system. So the state 1S0 would mean that the total spin S is 0 because (2S+1) = 1 implies S=0. So the spin part is symmetric because S=0 is a singlet, which is antisymmetric, but wait, no. Wait, for two identical fermions, the spin part is symmetric for triplet states (S=1) and antisymmetric for singlet (S=0). Wait, no, wait. The exchange symmetry: for a two-fermion system, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial part, spin part, and any other quantum numbers like isospin. Oh wait, but in this case, it's two nucleons (so identical fermions), and they are in a bound state with a specific quantum state.

But the problem says that the system emits a particle X. So the initial state is a bound NN pair, and the final state is the NN pair plus X. So the initial state is 1S0, which is the NN's state before emission.

Wait, the problem says that after emitting X, the NN state has T=0. So let's think about the initial and final states.

The initial state is 1S0, which is the NN system. So for the initial state, S (total spin) is 0 because (2S+1)=1. So S=0. The orbital angular momentum L is 0 since it's an S state. So the total angular momentum J of the initial state is 0 (since L=0 and S=0, so J must be 0). 

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's
