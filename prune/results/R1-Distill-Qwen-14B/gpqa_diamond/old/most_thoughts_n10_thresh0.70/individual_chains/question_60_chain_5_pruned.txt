Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens live about 150 years on average, but they're sending a 22-year-old astronaut to Earth. The question is, from the astronaut's perspective, how long will the trip take?

Wait, right, this is a relativity problem. At such high speeds, time dilation must come into play. Time dilation is when time moves slower for the moving observer (the astronaut) compared to a stationary one (like someone on Earth). So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

But wait, wait. The question is about the time the astronaut experiences. So that's the proper time, right? Because proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference, which in this case is the astronaut's ship.

I remember the time dilation formula is based on the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Let me plug in the numbers. The speed given is 0.99999987*c. That's really close to the speed of light. So v is approximately 0.99999987c. Let me compute v squared over c squared. 

So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.99999987 is almost 1, so squaring it... Let me compute it. 0.99999987 times itself. Hmm, 1 minus 0.00000013 (since (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small). So 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974000001. Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Let me see: (a - b)^2 is a² - 2ab + b². a=1, b=1.3e-7. So 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible. So 1 - 2.6e-7. So 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7). 

What's the square root of 2.6e-7? Let's see. 2.6e-7 is 0.00000026. The square root of that is around 0.00051 (since 0.0005^2 is 0.00000025, which is 2.5e-7, close to 2.6e-7). So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051. 

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.7. Wait, wait a second, 1 divided by 0.0005 is 2000, so 0.00051 is a bit more, so gamma is approximately 1960.7. 

Now, the next part. We need to compute the proper time experienced by the astronaut. But wait, to find the proper time, we need the distance to Earth as measured in the astronaut's frame. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the distance as seen from Earth and then compute the time from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, no, wait. The problem states that the spacecraft is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The question is about the time experienced by the astronaut. So we need to find the proper time, which would be the Earth distance divided by the speed, multiplied by the Lorentz factor? Or wait, no, perhaps I should think about the distance in the astronaut's frame.

Wait, no. Let me think. From Earth's perspective, the distance is D (the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud). The time taken is D/(v). But from the astronaut's perspective, length contraction occurs, so the distance is shorter. So the proper time T' is T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) )? Or wait, another approach: since the astronaut is moving at speed v relative to Earth, the distance they have to cover is contracted.

So, the distance in the astronaut's frame is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) )? No wait, length contraction is in the direction of motion. So when the astronaut is moving, the distance between Earth and their origin is contracted. So the time experienced by the astronaut is L / v.

But wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should start over.

From Earth's frame:

- Distance to Earth (assuming Earth is the destination) is D (say, for example, D in light-years, but wait, the problem doesn't give a distance, so perhaps it's a trick where the distance doesn't matter because we're looking for the astronaut's lifetime? Wait, no, the problem says 'how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth'—so it's about the time experienced, not the age upon arrival.

Wait, but if the astronaut is 22 years old and the trip takes X years (from their perspective), then their age upon arrival would be 22 + X. But we're not given any distance, so how can we compute the time taken for the trip?

Wait wait, maybe I'm missing something. The problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.9999998
