Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: Mw for KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and for Na2HPO4·2H2O it's 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe I don't have to worry about temperature effects on ionization for now.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in the solution. Hmm, wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4. But wait, no, orthophosphate is the primary phosphate form. Wait, I think the phosphate ions can exist in different forms depending on the pH. H3PO4 is triply deprotonated in orthophosphoric acid. But when it loses protons, it becomes H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-.

Wait, the problem is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Oh, right, orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? Or is it PO4^3-? Hmm, wait, I think orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2- because PO4^3- is called phosphite or something else? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, PO4^3- is orthophosphosphate, but I think HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the concentration of all the phosphate species, but no, I think it's specifically orthophosphate. Wait, the problem says
