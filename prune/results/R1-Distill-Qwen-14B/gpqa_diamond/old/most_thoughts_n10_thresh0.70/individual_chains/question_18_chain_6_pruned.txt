Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's read the problem carefully. There are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each more massive than the Sun. The question gives their masses, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. Probably more about the problem setup than the calculations.

The elemental abundances are given using logarithmic scales. Let me jot down the given values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I also remember that [X/Y] in stellar abundances is defined as log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic difference relative to the Sun.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that's (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

I think I need to find [Si/H] for both stars and then calculate the ratio.

Wait, let's think about each star separately.

Starting with Star_1:
Given [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun + 0.3.

But wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun + 0. So n_Fe in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun relative to H.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is a logarithmic measure. The formula is [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe / n_H) - log(n_Fe / n_H)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which implies log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

Given that the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero by definition.

But wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse the Sun's data correctly.

The Sun's data:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, it's 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, but why is it 12 plus? Oh, I remember that in stellar abundances, the numbers are often given as 12 + log10(n_X/n_H). So for hydrogen, nH is the number density, and the log is taken. So for the Sun, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. But wait, since the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, the second term is zero. So [Fe/H]_sun is (log(nFe/nH)_sun - log(nFe/nH)_sun) = 0.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number densities.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 â†’ log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

So n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun
