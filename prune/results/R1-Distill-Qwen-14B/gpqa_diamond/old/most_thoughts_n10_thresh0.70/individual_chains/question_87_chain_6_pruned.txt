Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted six-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Hmm, wait. Let me break this down. So the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, I think. Because it's a six-membered aromatic ring, which is benzene. But wait, the total number of carbon atoms is 8. Benzene has six carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. Oh, right, di-substitutedâ€”so two substituents attached to the benzene ring. Each substituent contributes some carbons.

The IR peaks tell me there's a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents probably include a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester or something. Also, one of the substituents is an aromatic halogen, like Cl, Br, etc., because that's what the aromatic-halogen bond would be. So one substituent is a halogen, and the other is a carbonyl-containing group.

Let's think about possible structures. Since the molecule has 8 carbons overall, the benzene (6 carbons) plus two substituents: each substituent must be one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? Wait, no, because it's di-substituted, so each substituent is a group attached to the ring, and each contributes some carbons.

Wait, benzene is six carbons. The substituents are two groups, each with one carbon. So each substituent is a single carbon. For example, one substituent could be a Cl (no carbons), but that can't be, because then the total would be 6 + 0 + (other substituent). Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount.

The molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so the two substituents must add 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero.

Wait, substitu
