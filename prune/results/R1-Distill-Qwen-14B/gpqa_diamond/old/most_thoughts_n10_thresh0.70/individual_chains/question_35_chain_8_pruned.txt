Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it.

The problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix's first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are often proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and are used for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons. So S probably represents the Y component of the Pauli matrices.

So let me write down the matrix S. The first row is 0 and -i, the second is i and 0. That looks like the Y Pauli matrix, which is usually denoted as σ_y. The standard σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be σ_y. 

Then, A_y = c * σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), let me plug that in. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Now, the question asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Eigenvalues of a matrix operator are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let's compute the matrix A_y - λI. 

So A_y = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. Subtracting λ I gives:

[[-λ, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), -λ]]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [(-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π)))].

Calculating each part: (-λ)(-λ) is λ². The second term: (-i)(i) is -i^2. Since i^2 is -1, so (-i)(i) = -(-1) = 1. Then multiply by (h/(4π))^2. So the second term is [1 * (h^2/(16 π²))]. Thus, the determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Setting this equal to zero: λ² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by a factor. So in this case, the eigenvalues would be ±c, where c is h/(4π). So yes, the eigenvalues are a = ±h/(4π). 

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues are purely real here. Because the operator A_y is Hermitian. Wait, is A_y Hermitian? The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and c is a real scalar. So yes, A_y should be Hermitian. Therefore, eigenvalues are real. So any option that suggests an imaginary part is wrong. 

Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are h/(4π), which is a real number. But wait, what's h? Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. But without exact numbers, it's about the form.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Wait, the matrix A_y is c * σ_y.
