Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. But I'm not exactly sure how that would change Maxwell's equations.

Maxwell's equations are four in total, right? Let me list them as I remember.

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is negative the time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of B is mu_0 times J plus mu_0 epsilon_0 times the time derivative of E.

Wait, in our world, the magnetic monopole doesn't exist, so the divergence of B is zero. But in this parallel universe, they can have isolated poles, which I think would change that equation.

So, normally, the second equation (div B = 0) holds. But if there are magnetic monopoles, that equation would change because there's a magnetic charge density. So instead, div B would be equal to rho_m / mu_0, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore.

Which Maxwell equations change? Well, in our world, both the divergence of B and the curl of B are zero because of the absence of monopoles and the nature of the fields. But wait, no—curl of B isn't zero. Ampère's law says curl B is something, right. Oh wait, no, Ampère's law includes the current and the displacement current. So, curl B isn't zero, it's related to the current and the time derivative of E.

Wait, no, Faraday's law is about the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. So, if magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect Faraday's law?

In our universe, the divergence of B is zero, which allows for the existence of magnetic monopoles. So if in the question's universe, they have isolated magnetic poles, the equation that changes would be the one where the divergence of B is non-zero. So that's equation two.

But wait, the question is about which equations look different. So
