Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I need to think carefully.

The question involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the setup is about a bicistronic vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So two coding regions in one vector. The vector uses lox-Cre technology, which I remember involves loxP sites for recombination. Oh wait, Cre is an enzyme that cuts loxP sites, leading to excision of the intervening DNA.

So the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. That means the two genes (ligand and receptor) are under some sort of regulatory elements and separated by lox sites. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Receptor at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, maybe constitutively active. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh, IRES is a Internal Ribosome Entry Site. IRES allows for translation of the second gene in a bicistronic mRNA without a second promoter. So the mRNA is translated twice: the first ORF (ligand) is translated from the CBA promoter, and the second (receptor) is translated using the IRES.

Wait, but there's a stop cassette in between. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So that would mean that without Cre, the stop signals are in place, preventing the fusion proteins from being made. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES, but the stops are in the way unless Cre is present to excise them.

So when Cre is introduced, the loxP sites will be cut, and the stop cassettes will be removed. This would allow the ligand to be expressed with mCherry and the receptor with eGFP as fusion proteins.

They made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells.

The offspring are born, and they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal. Green would come from eGFP, which is on the receptor. But they don't see green. So why?

The problem is that the eGFP isn't showing up. Let's think about the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the setup is about expression in neural crest cells, and the vector is designed to express both in the same cells. So I don't think this is the issue here. The problem is about expression in the same cell, not whether they act locally or elsewhere.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. Golgi issues would prevent proper trafficking. If the GFP isn't trafficking, maybe it's stuck. But the question mentions they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested on Western blot. So if the construct wasn't being expressed, the Western would show no signal. But the total proteins have actin loading, so the blot is working. Oh wait, but the question says the mouse model was crossed with SOX10-Cre, so the Cre would excise the stops only in neural crest-derived cells, like the astrocytes? Or the primary cultures.

Wait, the initial setup was in primary astrocyte culture after transfection. But after that, the mouse model was made. So in the mouse, the Cre is under SOX10 control, so it should be active in neural crest-derived cells. So when the Cre is expressed, it would excise the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed as mCherry and eGFP fusions.

But in the offspring, when they look for the eGFP signal, they don't see any. So why?

Looking at the vector setup: the ligand ORF is at 5', with mCherry, but the stop is in the loxP cassette upstream. The receptor is at 3', with eGFP and a lox2272 stop.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the mRNA is the same for both, but each has their own start and stop. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But if the Cre isn't active, then the stops prevent expression. But in the mouse, the Cre is under SOX10, which should be active in relevant cells.

So why no eGFP signal?

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Hmm, but the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES,
