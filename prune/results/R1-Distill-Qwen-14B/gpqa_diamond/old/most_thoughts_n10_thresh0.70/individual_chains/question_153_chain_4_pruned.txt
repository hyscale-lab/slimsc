Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to find the major products. Then, I have to match them with the given options (A, B, C, D), each of which has different products for A, B, and C.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH. So, what's the Michael addition here? I remember that the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good dienophile, but here it's probably acting as the nucleophile. Or wait, no, in the Michael reaction, the enolate is the nucleophile. So, which one is the nucleophile here?

Wait, the enolate would be generated from the more electron-rich component. So, dimethyl malonate is a good electron donor. Let me think: the enolate would come from the alpha position of the malonate. Then, it would attack the beta position of the other carbonyl, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That's an alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

So, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no: wait, the structure is CH2-CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the alpha. Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the structure is CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but on the 3-position (the CH2 is the first, CH is second, COO the third?), no. Wait, wait. So, the molecule is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO
