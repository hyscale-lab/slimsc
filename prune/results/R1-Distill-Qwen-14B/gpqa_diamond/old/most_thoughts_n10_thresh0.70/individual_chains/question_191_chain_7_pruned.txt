Okay, so I'm going to try to figure out what product 4 is in this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I hope I can get this right.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's CH2OH). And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2)- group attached? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C=CH2, but the substituent is on the second carbon. So it's CH2-C(CH2) something? Or maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, the structure is CH2-CH2-C=CH2? No, maybe it's CH2-CH(CH2)-something. Wait, no. Let's think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent on the second carbon. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. So the structure is CH2-C(CH2) attached to the cyclohexane ring? Or is it CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 1, and the substituent is at position 2. So the group is CH2-C=CH2, attached via the central carbon. So the substituent is CH2-C(=CH2)- attached to the cyclohexane. So, the 5 position has a CH2-C=CH2 group.

So the starting structure is a cyclohexanone (cyclohexane with a ketone at C1), with at C3 a CH2OH group, and at C5 a CH2-C=CH2 group.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) to form product 1.

NaH is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate things. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, so I think this is an alkylation reaction. But where?

In the starting compound, the ketone (cyclohexanone) is at C1. NaH would deprotonate something. What's available for deprotonation? The hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) at C3. The OH is acidic because it's next to a ketone. So, when treated with NaH, the OH would deprotonate to form an O- which is a good nucleophile.

So, the O- would attack the benzyl bromide. Benzyl bromide is an SN2 reagent, so the benzyl group (C6H5CH2-) would attach to the oxygen. So after alkylation, the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether. Wait, wait. Let's think: the starting group is CH2OH. Deprotonate to form CH2O- Na+. Then, benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) would provide PhCH2-O- after substitution. So the oxygen would have two CH2 groups attached? Wait, no. The initial group is CH2-OH. Deprotonate to CH2O-; then benzyl bromide is PhCH2Br. The O- would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to CH2-O-PhCH2- (but wait, no, that would be the benzyl group attached to the oxygen
