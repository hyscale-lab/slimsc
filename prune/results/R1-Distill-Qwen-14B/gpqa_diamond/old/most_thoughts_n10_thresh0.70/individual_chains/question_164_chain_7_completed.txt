Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, the radial velocity (RV) variations of the stars in each system are sinusoidal. 

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets, but in this case, we're dealing with binary stars. The RV variations are due to the Doppler effect as the stars move towards and away from us.

Wait, the amplitude of RV variations is related to the mass of the other star. Oh right, the more massive a star is, the larger the RV amplitude of its companion. Because the more massive star would cause the less massive one to move more. But wait, actually, both stars orbit the center of mass. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if one star is more massive, its velocity amplitude is smaller, and the less massive star has a larger velocity. 

Wait, let me think: in a two-body system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, right? So its velocity (as seen from Earth) will be smaller, and the less massive star will have a larger velocity. So in the RV measurements, the two stars' velocities have amplitudes that are inversely proportional to their masses. 

So, for system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say the primary star has a larger RV amplitude, but wait no, the primary eclipse refers to when the brighter star is eclipsed. Oh, but the RV amplitudes are for both stars. So in system_1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5. So let me denote them as v1 and v2. 

I remember that in a binary system, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses. So v1/v2 = m2/m1. Because m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. So since velocity v is 2πa/P, then v1/v2 = a1/a2 = m2/m1. 

So, for each system, let's compute the mass function. The mass function relates the observed RV velocities to the masses. The formula is something like:

(m2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (m1 + m2)^2 ) ) = ( (v1 * P) / (2π G) )^3 

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, for each system, the mass ratio q is m2/m1. The RV semi-amplitudes are K1 and K2, which are inversely proportional to the masses. So K1/K2 = m2/m1 = q. So in system_1, K1 is 10 and K2 is 5. So K1/K2 = 2. So 2 = q, which would mean q = m2/m1 = 2. So m2 = 2 m1. Then the total mass M = m1 + m2 = m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1. So m1 = M/3, m2 = 2 M/3.

Wait, but I think the formula is that the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is inverse of the mass ratio. Because the more massive star has a smaller orbit, hence a slower velocity. So K = v semi-amplitude. So K1/K2 = m2/m1. So if K1 is 10 and K2 is 5, then 10/5 = 2 = m2/m1. So m2 = 2 m1. So the total mass M = m1 + m2 = 3 m1. So m1 = M/3, m2 = 2 M/3.

Similarly, for system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. So K1=15, K2=10. K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2 = 1.5. So m2/m1 = 3/2, so m2 = 1.5 m1. So total mass M' = m1 + m2 = m1 + 1.5 m1 = 2.5 m1. So m1 = M'/(2.5), m2 = (1.5 M')/(2.5).

But wait, I think that the actual masses are determined by considering the system's period and the RV amplitudes. The mass function involves the period and the RV semi-amplitudes. The formula for the mass function is:

f(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1)^3 ) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, the formula for the mass function is:

f(m) = (K1^3 P) / (2943)

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should recall that the mass of the system can be related to the sum of the RV semi-amplitudes and the period. Wait, perhaps the total mass is determined by the relative velocities and the period.

Wait, another approach: in a binary system, the velocity of each star is related to the mass of the other. So K1 = (2π G)^{1/3} (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^{2/3} P^{1/3} ) )

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think again. 

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v * sin i) 

Wait, no. Let me think about the binary orbit. The velocity of each star can be determined from the center of mass condition. So m1 a1 = m2 a2, where a is the orbital radius. The period P is the same for both. So a1 = (m2/(m1+m2)) * a_total, and a2 = (m1/(m1+m2)) * a_total. 

The velocity of each star is v = 2π a / P. So v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π (m2/(m1+m2)) a_total / P. Similarly, v2 = 2π (m1/(m1+m2)) a_total / P. 

But since a_total is the separation, and the sum a1 + a2 = a_total.

Wait, but for the RV semi-amplitude, each star's velocity amplitude is K1 and K2, and K1 is for the star with mass m2. Wait, maybe I should get the formula right.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (2π G )^{1/3} * (M_{companion} sin i) ) / ( (M1 + M2)^{2/3} P^{1/3} ) )

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me perhaps look for a simpler approach. 

Wait, considering that in a binary system, the sum of the velocities times their respective masses are equal and opposite. So m1 * K1 = m2 * K2, where K1 and K2 are the RV semi-amplitudes of the two stars. 

Because the center of mass requires that m1 a1 = m2 a2, and since a is proportional to velocity times period (a = v * P/(2π)), because v = 2π a / P → a = v P/(2π). So m1 * (v1) = m2 * (v2). 

Wait, but in reality, both stars orbit the center of mass with velocities proportional to the inverse of their masses. So m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. So, v1 / v2 = m2 / m1. 

So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So v1/v2 = 10/5 = 2. So m2/m1 = 2. So m2 = 2 m1. So the total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = 3 m1.

For system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So v1/v2 =15/10 =3/2. So m2/m1 =3/2 → m2 = 1.5 m1. So M2 = m1 + m2 = 2.5 m1.

Wait, but I'm considering m1 as the same for both systems, which might not be correct because each system's m1 could be different. So perhaps I should denote the masses in each system separately.

Let me clarify. For system_1: 

m1_1 and m2_1.

Similarly, system_2: m1_2 and m2_2.

In system_1: K1_1 =10, K2_1=5.

So, K1_1/K2_1 = m2_1/m1_1 → 10/5=2 → m2_1 = 2 m1_1.

So M1 = m1_1 + m2_1 = 3 m1_1.

Similarly, for system_2: K1_2=15, K2_2=10.

So 15/10 =3/2 → m2_2 = (3/2) m1_2.

M2 = m1_2 + m2_2 = m1_2 (1 + 3/2) ) = (5/2) m1_2.

Now, the question is about the total mass of each system, and by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

But I think we need more information. Because the mass function also depends on the orbital period and the inclination of the orbit. Oh wait, because the RV measurements depend on sine of the inclination. But unless we know the inclination, can we find the actual masses?

Wait, but maybe the mass ratio can be determined without knowing the inclination. Because the mass ratio would be determined by the ratio of the RV amplitudes. Because v1/v2 = m2/m1.

Wait, but to get the actual masses, we need the period and the inclination. Hmm. But the problem doesn't give the inclination, so perhaps we can only compare the mass ratios of the two systems.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that both systems have the same inclination, like edge-on, so i=90 degrees, sin i =1. But that's a big assumption. Without that, we can't find the absolute masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relationship between the velocities, the period, and the masses to find the mass ratio.

Wait, the formula for the mass of each star in terms of the RV amplitudes and the period. Let me recall that the mass function is:

f(m) = (K^3 P) / (2943) 

But wait, f(m) is defined as (m2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (m1 + m2)^2 )

So, f(m) = (K1^3 P) / (2943)

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Another approach: the orbital period is the same for both stars. The velocity semi-amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the companion. So, for each system, the velocity semi-amplitudes are K1 and K2, and their sum would be K1 + K2 = (m2 + m1) * something. Wait, perhaps I should relate the velocities to the masses and the period.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the system (M = m1 + m2) can be calculated using the formula:

M = (4 π² / G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²

But since a1 = (m2/(M)) * a_total and a2 = (m1/(M)) * a_total, a_total is the separation.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think about the mass function for each system.

For system_1, the mass function is f1 = (K1^3 P1) / (2943), where P1 is 2 years. Similarly, for system_2, f2 = (K2^3 P2) / 2943, but which K do I use?

Wait, no. The mass function for each star in the system is f(m) = (K^3 P) / (2943) * (1 + q)^2, where q is the mass ratio m2/m1.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The mass function is given by:

f(m) = ( (K * sin i)^3 * P ) / (2943 )

where K is the RV semi-amplitude of the companion star, and P is the orbital period in years.

But without knowing the inclination i, we can't find the actual mass. However, if we consider that the mass function only gives a lower limit to the mass ratio, but perhaps in this problem, the inclination is the same for both systems, so we can compare the two mass functions.

Wait, but the problem asks for the mass of the system, which is the sum of the two stars. So perhaps the mass ratio between the two systems can be found using the RV amplitudes and the periods.

Let me think of the formula that relates the mass function to the actual mass. The mass function is:

f(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So if we have f1 and f2 for the two systems, perhaps we can relate them.

Wait, but without knowing the sines of the inclinations, I can't directly compare the masses. So perhaps the problem is assuming that both systems have the same inclination, which allows us to compare their mass functions in a way that reflects the actual mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the mass ratio within each system, and how that relates to the total mass.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the period is given for each system, and the RV amplitudes, perhaps we can find the ratio of the masses.

Wait, from system_1: m2_1 = 2 m1_1 → M1 = 3 m1_1.

From system_2: m2_2 = 1.5 m1_2 → M2 = 2.5 m1_2.

But how do these relate to each other? Because the periods are different, so perhaps the actual masses are scaled by the period.

Wait, the formula for the mass function also involves the period. So perhaps the total mass of each system depends on both the RV amplitudes and the period.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of a different approach. The mass of a binary system can be determined using the formula:

M = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (something with G and pi) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the total velocity of the system (K1 + K2) is related to the orbital speed, which relates to the mass. But I'm not recalling the exact formula.

Alternatively, let's think about the mass ratio.

In system_1, the mass ratio q1 = m2_1/m1_1 = 2.

In system_2, q2 = m2_2/m1_2 = 1.5.

But the problem is asking for the ratio of the total masses of the two systems: M1 / M2.

M1 = m1_1 + m2_1 = m1_1 (1 + q1) = m1_1 * 3.

M2 = m1_2 + m2_2 = m1_2 (1 + q2) = m1_2 * 2.5.

So M1/M2 = (3 m1_1) / (2.5 m1_2) ) = (3/2.5) * (m1_1 / m1_2).

But I still don't know m1_1 and m1_2. So perhaps I need another equation.

Wait, perhaps the mass function for each system can be related. For system_1, the mass function f1 is f1 = (m2_1^3 sin^3 i1) / ( (m1_1 + m2_1)^2 )

Similarly, for system_2, f2 = (m2_2^3 sin^3 i2) / ( (m1_2 + m2_2)^2 )

If the systems are such that sin i1 = sin i2 (same inclination), then perhaps we can relate f1 and f2.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can't make that assumption. But maybe the problem expects us to proceed without considering inclination, perhaps assuming sin i =1 for both, i.e., edge-on orbits.

If that's the case, then f1 and f2 can be used to find the mass functions, which would be proportional to the actual masses.

Wait, but the mass function f(m) is given by:

f(m) = ( (K sin i)^3 P ) / (2943 )

But since I don't know sin i, perhaps I can't proceed this way.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is proportional to (K1 + K2) * (something with the period). I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, another approach: in the case of a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^{1/3} ( (M2 sin i) ) / ( (M1 + M2)^{2/3} (P year)^{1/3} ) )

But this is for each star. So for each system, the two K's would be K1 and K2, which are the RV amplitudes of the two stars.

But again, without knowing sin i, I can't find the actual masses. So perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the inclination is the same for both systems, allowing us to compare their mass functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the mass function ratio.

Let me think: For system_1, the mass function f1 is proportional to (K1^3 P1).

Similarly, for system_2, f2 is proportional to (K2^3 P2).

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me try to model this.

For system_1: 

f1 = ( (K1_1)^3 P1 ) / 2943 

Similarly, for system_2: 

f2 = ( (K2_2)^3 P2 ) / 2943 

Wait, but which K do I use? For system_1, the K's are 10 and 5, so perhaps each system contributes two K's. But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps each system's mass function depends on the sum of the product of the velocities and masses. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the velocities (K1 + K2) is related to the total mass.

Wait, the total mass of the system is M = m1 + m2.

The velocity of the center of mass in the system is zero because they orbit each other. So, m1 * K1 = m2 * K2 → K1/K2 = m2/m1.

Which brings us back to K1/K2 = m2/m1 → m2 = (K1/K2) m1.

So, M = m1 + m2 = m1 (1 + K1/K2 ) = m1 ( (K2 + K1)/ K2 )

But without another equation, I can't find m1.

Wait, but the period is given. Maybe the formula for the orbital period can help. The orbital period P is given by Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 π² G)⁻1 (4 π² a^3) / (G M) )

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of a binary system is:

P² = (4 π² / G M) a³.

But a is the separation between the two stars. Alternatively, a can be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period.

Wait, velocity v = 2 π a / P → a = v P / (2 π).

But each star has a different velocity. So, a1 = (v1 P)/(2 π), a2 = (v2 P)/(2 π).

But a1 + a2 = a_total.

So, a_total = (v1 + v2) P/(2 π).

But the separation a_total is related to the masses via Kepler's law: 

P² = (4 π² G)⁻1 * (a_total)^3 * (G M) )

Wait, another approach: The formula for the mass function is:

f(m) = (K^3 P) / (2943) 

Where K is the RV semi-amplitude of the companion, and P is in years.

But without knowing K for both stars, perhaps we can't proceed. Wait, but for each system, the sum of the mass functions would be equal to the total mass?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. Since the problem gives the RV amplitudes for both stars in each system, perhaps I can compute the mass ratio for each system and then compare the total masses.

In system_1: the mass ratio q1 = m2_1/m1_1 = K1_1/K2_1 = 10/5 = 2. So m2_1 = 2 m1_1. M1 = 3 m1_1.

In system_2: q2 = K1_2/K2_2 =15/10=1.5. So m2_2=1.5 m1_2. M2 = 2.5 m1_2.

Now, to find M1/M2, we need to find (3 m1_1) / (2.5 m1_2).

But without knowing the relation between m1_1 and m1_2, I can't proceed. So perhaps I need another equation that relates m1_1 and m1_2.

Wait, perhaps the period plays a role here. The period is the same for both stars in a system, so perhaps the period can relate to the masses.

Wait, the orbital period P is the same for both stars in a system. So Kepler's third law applies: (P^2 G M) = 4 π² a³.

But a is the separation between the stars, which is a = a1 + a2. 

From the center of mass condition, a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) a, a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) a.

So, a1 = (m2/(M)) a, a2 = (m1/(M)) a.

But the orbital velocity of each star is v1 = 2 π a1 / P = 2 π (m2 a)/(M P )

Similarly, v2 = 2 π a2 / P = 2 π (m1 a)/(M P )

But from the RV observations, v1 is K1_1 =10 for system_1, and v2 is K2_1=5.

So, for system_1: 10 = (2 π a m2_1 )/( M1 P )

Similarly, 5 = (2 π a m1_1 )/( M1 P )

But M1 = m1_1 + m2_1 = 3 m1_1.

Also, m2_1 =2 m1_1.

So substituting:
10 = [2 π a * 2 m1_1 ] / (3 m1_1 * P )
→ 10 = (4 π a )/(3 P )

Similarly, 5 = [2 π a m1_1 ] / (3 m1_1 * P )
→ 5 = (2 π a )/(3 P )

Hmm, so for system_1, both equations give the same relation. 

Similarly, for system_2:

K1_2 =15 = (2 π a_2 m2_2 )/( M2 P_2 )
K2_2 =10 = (2 π a_2 m1_2 )/( M2 P_2 )

M2 = m1_2 + m2_2 = 2.5 m1_2.

m2_2 = 1.5 m1_2.

So substituting into K1_2:

15 = [2 π a_2 * 1.5 m1_2 ] / (2.5 m1_2 * P_2 )

Simplify: 15 = [3 π a_2 ]/(2.5 P_2 )

Similarly, K2_2=10 = [2 π a_2 m1_2 ]/(2.5 m1_2 P_2 ) → 10 = (2 π a_2 )/(2.5 P_2 )

Hmm, so from system_1:

10 = (2 π a_1 )/(3 P_1 )

And from system_2:

10 = (2 π a_2 )/(2.5 P_2 )

Wait, but what are a_1 and a_2? a_1 is the separation in system_1, a_2 in system_2.

But how do these relate to the mass M?

From Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² G)^{-1} (a^3 G M )

→ P² = (4 π²) a^3/(G M )

So, M = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

So, for system_1:

M1 = (4 π² a_1³ )/( G P1² )

Similarly, for system_2:

M2 = (4 π² a_2³ )/( G P2² )

So, the ratio M1/M2 = (a_1³ / a_2³ ) * (P2² / P1² )

But from the RV equations, for system_1:

10 = (2 π a_1 )/(3 P1 )

So,

a_1 = (10 * 3 P1 )/( 2 π ) = (30 P1 )/(2 π ) = (15 P1 )/ π.

Similarly, for system_2:

From K2_2=10:

10 = (2 π a_2 )/(2.5 P2 )

→ a_2 = (10 * 2.5 P2 )/(2 π ) = (25 P2 )/(2 π )

So, a_1 = (15 P1 )/ π

a_2 = (25 P2 )/(2 π )

Substituting into M1/M2:

M1/M2 = [ ( (15 P1/ π )^3 ) / ( (25 P2/(2 π ))^3 ) ) ] * [ (P2^2) / (P1^2) ) ]

Simplify the a terms:

(15^3 P1^3 / π^3 ) / (25^3 P2^3 / (2 π )^3 ) )= (15^3 P1^3 * (2 π )^3 ) / (25^3 P2^3 π^3 )

= (15^3 * 8 π^3 * P1^3 ) / (25^3 π^3 P2^3 )

= (15^3 * 8 ) / (25^3 ) * (P1^3 / P2^3 )

So, M1/M2 = [ (15^3 *8 )/(25^3 ) * (P1^3 / P2^3 ) ] * [ P2^2 / P1^2 ]

= [ (15^3 *8 )/(25^3 ) ] * (P1^3 / P2^3 ) * ( P2^2 / P1^2 )

= [ (15^3 *8 )/(25^3 ) ] * ( P1 / P2 )

Given that P1 =2 years, P2=1 year.

So,

M1/M2 = [ (15^3 *8 )/(25^3 ) ] * (2/1 )

Let's compute the numerical value.

First, compute 15^3 = 3375.

25^3 = 15625.

So,

(3375 *8 ) = 27000.

27000 / 15625 = (27000 ÷ 15625) = 1.728.

Then multiply by 2: 1.728 * 2 = 3.456.

Wait, that can't be right because the options given are around 0.4-1.2. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recheck the computations.

Wait, let me compute:

(15/25)^3 = (3/5)^3 = 27/125.

Multiply by 8: (27 *8 ) / 125 = 216/125 = 1.728.

Then multiply by (P1/P2) =2/1=2.

So 1.728 * 2 = 3.456.

But that would imply M1 is 3.456 times M2. But the options don't have this. The options are ~0.4, ~0.6, ~1.2, ~0.7.

Wait, that's a problem. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Let me retrace. The a_1 and a_2 were derived from the RV equations.

Wait, for system_1, from K1_1 =10:

10 = (2 π a_1 m2_1 )/( M1 P1 )

But M1 =3 m1_1, and m2_1 =2 m1_1 → m2_1 = (2/3) M1.

So,

10 = (2 π a_1 * (2/3 M1) ) / ( M1 P1 )

Simplify:

10 = (4 π a_1 )/(3 P1 )

So,

a_1 = (10 * 3 P1 )/(4 π ) = (30 P1 )/(4 π ) = (15 P1 )/(2 π )

Similarly, for system_2, from K2_2 =10:

10 = (2 π a_2 m1_2 )/( M2 P2 )

M2=2.5 m1_2, so m1_2 = (2/5) M2.

So,

10 = (2 π a_2 * (2/5 M2) ) / ( M2 P2 )

Simplify:

10 = (4 π a_2 )/(5 P2 )

→ a_2 = (10 *5 P2 )/(4 π ) = (50 P2)/(4 π ) = (25 P2 )/(2 π )

Ah, okay, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of a_1 and a_2.

So, a_1 = (15 P1 )/(2 π ), and a_2 = (25 P2 )/(2 π )

So now, let's recalculate M1/M2.

M1 = (4 π² a_1³ )/( G P1^2 )

M2 = (4 π² a_2³ )/( G P2^2 )

So,

M1/M2 = (a_1^3 / a_2^3 ) * ( P2^2 / P1^2 )

Substituting a_1 and a_2:

a_1 = (15 P1 )/(2 π )

a_2 = (25 P2 )/(2 π )

So,

a_1/a_2 = [15 P1/(2 π ) ] / [25 P2/(2 π ) ] = (15 P1 ) / (25 P2 ) = (3 P1 )/(5 P2 )

So,

(a_1/a_2 )^3 = (3^3 P1^3 )/(5^3 P2^3 ) )= 27 P1^3 / (125 P2^3 )

Then,

M1/M2 = [27 P1^3 / (125 P2^3 ) ] * [ (P2^2 )/( P1^2 ) ) ] 

= 27/(125) * [ P1^3 / P2^3 ) * P2^2 / P1^2 ) ]

= 27/125 * ( P1 / P2 )

Given P1=2, P2=1:

= (27/125) * (2/1) = 54/125 ≈ 0.432.

So approximately 0.43. Looking back at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6.

So the factor is approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A (~0.4). Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in a step.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the expression for M1/M2 after substitution is:

M1/M2 = [ (a_1³) / (a_2³) ) ] * [ P2² / P1² ]

Given a_1 = (15 P1 )/(2 π ), a_2 = (25 P2 )/(2 π )

So,

a_1/a_2 = [15 P1/(2 π ) ] / [25 P2/(2 π ) ] = (15 P1 )/(25 P2 ) ) = (3 P1)/(5 P2 )

So, (a_1/a_2 )^3 = (3^3 P1^3 )/(5^3 P2^3 ) )= 27 P1^3/(125 P2^3 )

Now, multiply by P2^2 / P1^2:

So,

(27 P1^3 / (125 P2^3 )) * ( P2^2 / P1^2 ) = 27/(125) * (P1/ P2 )

P1=2, P2=1 → 27/(125) * 2 = 54/125 = 0.432.

So, M1 is approximately 0.432 times M2.

Wait, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So M1 = 0.432 M2 → system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

The options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

So the closest is A) ~0.4.

But wait, wait! Oh my God, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of M1/M2.

Because M1 is the mass of system_1, and M2 is the mass of system_2.

If M1 is 0.432 M2, that means system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

But the question says, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If system_1 is less massive, it's not more. So perhaps I mixed up the ratio.

Wait, the computation came to M1/M2 = 0.432. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is bigger. So system_1 is less massive.

But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. If it's 0.43 times, then system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. So the correct factor is 0.43, meaning system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the answer is 0.43, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I messed up the ratio.

Wait, M1 = 0.432 M2 → M2 = M1 /0.432 ≈ 2.315 M1. So system_2 is more massive than system_1 by a factor of about 2.3. But the question is asking about system_1 being more massive than system_2. So if the factor is 0.43, then system_1 is less massive.

The question is phrased as: 'By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?' If the factor is less than 1, that would imply system_1 is less massive.

But perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of the ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's M2/M1 = 1/(0.432)= ~2.315. But the question is about M1 compared to M2. So M1 is about 0.432 times M2. So it's 0.43 times as massive.

So the answer should be ~0.4, which is option A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data:

### Key Observations:
1. **System 1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity (RV) amplitudes: \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Mass ratio: \( q_1 = \frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \)
   - Total mass: \( M_1 = m_1 + m_2 = m_1 + 2m_1 = 3m_1 \)

2. **System 2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \)
   - Radial velocity (RV) amplitudes: \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Mass ratio: \( q_2 = \frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \)
   - Total mass: \( M_2 = m_1 + m_2 = m_1 + 1.5m_1 = 2.5m_1 \)

### Relationship Between Masses:
The total mass of each system depends on the orbital separation \( a \), which is proportional to the RV semi-amplitudes and the orbital period. Using Kepler's third law and the relationship between \( a \), \( P \), and \( M \), the ratio of the total masses is:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{P_1^2}
\]

From the RV data:
\[
a_1 \propto \frac{K_1 P_1}{\text{constant}}, \quad a_2 \propto \frac{K_2 P_2}{\text{constant}}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) into the mass ratio equation:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{\left(\frac{K_1 P_1}{K_2 P_2}\right)^3}{1} \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{P_1^2}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{K_1^3 P_1}{K_2^3 P_2} \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{P_1^2} = \frac{K_1^3}{K_2^3} \cdot \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
K_1 = 10, \, K_2 = 10, \, P_1 = 2, \, P_2 = 1
\]

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{10^3}{10^3} \cdot \frac{2}{1} = 1 \cdot 2 = 2
\]

Thus, system_1 is **2 times more massive** than system_2. However, this contradicts the options provided, which suggest a smaller factor. Reassessing the calculations, the correct ratio is approximately \( 0.43 \), meaning system_1 is about **0.43 times as massive** as system_2. Therefore, system_1 is **less massive** than system_2 by a factor of ~0.4.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is closest to **0.4**.
