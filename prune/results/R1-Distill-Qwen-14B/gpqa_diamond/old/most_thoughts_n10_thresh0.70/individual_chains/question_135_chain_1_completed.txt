Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson field X. The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and the mass of the boson as 6 GeV. I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Let me start by recalling what I know. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, right, the structure looks like a Yukawa interaction. The general form for Yukawa couplings is something like L = g ψ ψ φ, where φ is a scalar field. So in this case, the boson X is interacting with fermions ψ_f. The term inside the Lagrangian includes (υ + X), which suggests that υ is probably the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of some scalar field, maybe the Higgs. So X is a fluctuation around that VEV, making it a massive boson after symmetry breaking.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So when X decays, the products must be fermions whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV. Because, in particle physics, a particle can't decay into particles whose rest mass exceeds its own. So the invariant mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

Wait, but what particles are involved here? The interaction is with fermions ψ_f, which I guess are fundamental fermions, like leptons or quarks. Each ψ_f is a fermion, and the decay would produce a pair of these fermions, like ψ_f and ψ_f-bar, right?

So for each possible fermion ψ_f, I need to check their mass. The decay X → ψ_f ψ_f̄ will be allowed if the mass of ψ_f is less than or equal to half of X's mass, because 2m_ψ_f ≤ m_X.

X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses. Let me think:

- Up quark (u): approximately 2.2 MeV (so way under 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 - 100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are very light, but I think in most cases, they're considered massless or nearly so. But the problem doesn't mention them, so maybe we can ignore them.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is about the decay X → fermion-antifermion pair. So for each fermion, if their mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV, then X can decay into them.

So let's go through each fermion:

- b quark: 4.5 GeV. 4.5 > 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar.
- c quark: 1.5 GeV. That's less than 3 GeV, so allowed.
- s quark: 0.1 GeV, allowed.
- u quark: 0.002 GeV, allowed.
- d quark: ~0.0047 GeV, allowed.
- tau lepton: 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau pair allowed.
- muon: 0.105 GeV, allowed.
- electron: 0.0005 GeV, allowed.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the decay modes listed in the options. So let's look at the options.

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, the b quark is 4.5 GeV. X is 6 GeV, but 2m_b = 9 GeV, which is bigger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Hmm, let's check each:

c quark: 1.5 GeV. 2m_c = 3 GeV, so equal to X's mass. So allowed (since 2m ≤ m_X is allowed, as equality is allowed).

s: 0.1 GeV, okay.

u, d: way below.

Tau: 1.78 GeV. 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait, wait. Wait, tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau would be 3.56 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, so 3.56 <6, so allowed. So tau can decay.

Wait, no, wait. X is 6 GeV. The mass of the tau is 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So decay into tau pairs is allowed.

Wait, but 3.56 GeV is less than 6? Yes, so allowed. So the tau pair is allowed.

Wait, but wait, the tau is heavy, but within the limit.

So in option B, the c quark is allowed, but what about the others?

So option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, which all have 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

But wait, the c quark has 2m_c =3 GeV, which is allowed.

So option B includes all the correct fermions except for the b quark.

Wait, but the option B doesn't have b. So looking at the options:

Option D: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But wait, as I thought earlier, b is too heavy.

So why is option D included? It includes b, which shouldn't be allowed.

So the correct decay channels are the ones where the fermion mass is ≤3 GeV. So the fermions allowed are:

c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Which is what option B includes, right? So option B should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait—what about the top quark? The t quark is 173 GeV, way above, so it's not a decay option.

So looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

But wait, what about the bottom quark? If the X is 6 GeV, then 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So, decay into b b-bar is not allowed. So in the options, any that include b are incorrect.

Looking again at the options:

Option A includes b. So A is wrong.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so C is wrong.

Option D includes b, which is wrong.

Option B doesn't include b, but includes c, which is allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait, another point: the interaction term is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(v + X(y))ψf(y).

Hmm, perhaps the notation is a bit different. Let me parse the interaction term correctly.

The term is λf f(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). So, the interaction is between the boson X and the fermion ψf. So for each fermion ψf that X can interact with, X can decay into ψf and ψf-bar.

But what determines which fermions ψf are present? The coupling is for each fermion species. So, if the boson X has a coupling to all the fermions, then each fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

But perhaps the Lagrangian only includes certain fermions. But the question says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so I think it's implying that X can decay into any of the fermions that the Lagrangian allows. So the fact that the Lagrangian is written as λf f(y)(v +X)ψf(y) suggests that X couples to ψf for each f.

So regardless, the decay possibilities are all the fermions with mass below 3 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are:

c (1.5 GeV), s (0.1 GeV), u (0.002 GeV), d (0.0047 GeV), tau (1.78 GeV), mu (0.105 GeV), e (0.0005 GeV).

So decay products can be any of these.

But wait, another point: the term in the Lagrangian is -λf f(y) (v + X) ψf(y). Wait, perhaps the f here is a Yukawa coupling parameter. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the structure in terms of the Dirac notation.

Wait, the interaction term would typically look like L = g ψ ψ X, but perhaps in this case, it's a trilinear term? No, wait, X is a boson, and ψ is a spinor. So more accurately, the interaction is between X and a pair of fermions.

So the term would look like L = -g ψ_f ψ_f X. So that would imply that X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair. So the coupling is to all possible fermions ψ_f, but each with their own coupling strength.

So the decay modes are possible for all fermions with mass m ≤ m_X/2.

So, the fermions with masses under 3 GeV can be decay products.

So the fermions allowed are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. Because all these have masses under 3 GeV. Wait, c is 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is allowed because 3 GeV is equal to m_X/2.

Wait, but the tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV which is less than 6 GeV? No, wait, no, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Wait, yes, 3.56 <6, so tau is allowed.

So all these fermions can be decay products except for the b and t quarks, which are too heavy.

Looking back at the options, the correct decay channels are those that include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So which option is that?

Option B says X → c cbar, s sbar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but wait another thing: the mass of the tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau is allowed.

So option B includes all the correct fermions except for the b quark.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, provided the total rest mass of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \). Specifically, for a decay \( X \to \psi_f \bar{\psi}_f \), the condition is \( 2m_{\psi_f} \leq m_X \), where \( m_{\psi_f} \) is the mass of the fermion \( \psi_f \).

The fermion masses are as follows:
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( 2m_{\psi_f} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are too heavy to be decay products.

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_{\psi_f} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is too heavy. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
