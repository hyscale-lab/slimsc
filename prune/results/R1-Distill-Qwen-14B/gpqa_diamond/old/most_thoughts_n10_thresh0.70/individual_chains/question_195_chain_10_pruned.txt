Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

So, there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet, which is biggerâ€”2.5 Earth radii. This second planet will also transit and occult. What's the maximum orbital period it can have?

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits its star, it passes directly in front from our point of view, blocking some light. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, and we stop seeing its reflected light. For both to happen, the planets must be aligned in their orbits such that their orbital planes are the same, which they are here.

But the key point is probably about the orbital period. The second planet must be in a position where it can both transit and be occulted. Wait, but how do the periods affect this? Oh right, it's about the synodic period. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the timing of their orbits.

Wait, I think the maximum period would be when the two planets are aligned in such a way that they don't interfere too much. Or perhaps it's about the Hill sphere or something else, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's about the period ratio.

Wait, I remember that for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on. So both planets are in the same orbital plane, which is edge-on to us, so both transit.

Now, the second planet needs to sometimes be behind the star (occultation) and sometimes in front (transit). But how does that affect the period?

Wait, maybe it's about the time it takes for the other planet to get into a position where it can transit again. Or perhaps the maximum period is determined by the time it takes for the two planets to align such that both events happen.

Wait, but the problem says that the second planet must exhibit both events. So it must transit and occult. For that, the planet's orbital period must be such that during its orbit, it sometimes is in front and sometimes behind relative to our line of sight.

Wait, but wait. The star is much larger than the planet. So for a second planet to also transit, its
