Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this.

First, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where the lattice is rhombohedral, meaning all the edges are equal in length and the angles between them are equal too. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Ångströms, and each of the angles α, β, γ is 30 degrees. 

Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a'. So here, a = 10 Å. And the angles between the lattice vectors are all 30 degrees. Since all the angles are the same, this is a special case called a trigonal crystal system, I think. But maybe rhombohedral is a more specific term.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ). But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula because sometimes the angles come into play differently.

Wait, no, maybe the formula for the interplanar spacing in a general crystal system is d = (a²)/(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )^(1/2). Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that for cubic systems where the angles are 90 degrees, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in this case, it's a rhombohedral system, so all angles are 30 degrees, and the system isn't cubic.

So the general formula for interplanar spacing is: 

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta } }

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos γ) } }

Wait, wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me check back. Oh, I think I should use the formula from crystallography textbooks. The general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles α, β, γ is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk \cos α + hk cos β + hk cos γ) ? Hmm, no, I think the formula is more accurately:

d^2 = (a²)( h² + k² + l² ) / ( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) )

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Maybe an alternative approach. Let me think about the structure factor or the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between the plane and the lattice vectors.

Wait, another approach: For a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a special case where a = b = c, and α = β = γ. Since all the angles are the same, maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, I think I should recall that for
