Okay, so I have this physics problem about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about the state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I remember that electrons in hydrogen atoms transition between energy levels, emitting or absorbing photons, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules for dipole transitions again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are: 

- The principal quantum number n can change by ±1 (so Δn = ±1), but wait no, wait. Actually, I think for hydrogen, the dipole selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2? Or was it that Δn can be any except 0? No, no, wait, dipole transitions require that the photon carries away a certain amount of energy, so the change in n is such that the energy levels allow it. Wait no, the standard dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1. Oh wait no, wait: wait, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δn = any, but wait no, wait no, maybe I'm mixing it up. 

Wait, no, wait. I think the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1, and Δn can be any except 0. Because the photon has to carry away the difference in energy, so n can change by any number
