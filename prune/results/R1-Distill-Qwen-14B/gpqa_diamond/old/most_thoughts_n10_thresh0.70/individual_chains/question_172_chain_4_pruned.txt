Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. The problem assumes the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means the Boltzmann distribution applies here.

Wait, I remember that the Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations being (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Oh right, g is the degeneracy, but the question says the energy levels are the same for both stars, so maybe g is the same, so it cancels out. So the ratio of populations (n2/n1) is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), but wait, wait. Oh wait, no, because n1 is the lower energy level and n2 is the upper. Or maybe not, depends on how the difference is set up.

Wait, the energy difference is given. Let's say that the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. Then the ratio of the populations would be n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). But the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So wait, I think in star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2. Or wait, wait, the way the question is phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think it means that in star_1, the number of iron atoms in that energy level is twice that of star_2. So n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited. Or maybe not, because the question could be about the same level in both stars? Wait, no, the specific energy levelâ€”so same energy level for both stars. So the ratio n1
