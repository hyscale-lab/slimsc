Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, with small values of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) and B is 1 Tesla. I need to figure out whether the paramagnetic term is much larger, much smaller, or similar to the transition energy ΔE.

Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism involves the interaction between magnetic dipoles and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is something like the Zeeman term, right? The energy is given by the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is related to the spin, but wait, in this case, it's probably the orbital magnetic moment since m is the orbital quantum number.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, orbital magnetic quantum number is l, and the z-component of orbital angular momentum is m times ħ. The magnetic moment due to orbital motion is μ = (μ0/(4π)) * (e/(2m_e)) ) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, I recall that the orbital magnetic moment is given by μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e) * (l/(l(l+1))^{1/2}) ) * m. Wait, perhaps that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the Zeeman effect formula.

The Zeeman energy is given by E = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is (μ_B) m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e) * (m_l / sqrt(l(l+1))) )? Or maybe that's the expectation value. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, which can be written as H = -g_j μ_B m_j B, where g_j is the Landé g-factor. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me step back. The problem is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which
