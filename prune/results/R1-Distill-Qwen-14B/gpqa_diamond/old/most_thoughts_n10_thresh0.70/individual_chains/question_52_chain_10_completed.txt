Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again carefully to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay, so I think this is related to the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of different energy levels changes with temperature.

The Boltzmann equation in its basic form is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the populations of the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 is given. The question says that this ratio decreases when there are spots. Since the spots cause the overall temperature to drop, the ratio must be temperature-dependent in such a way that a lower temperature leads to a lower ratio.

Wait, let me think about how the ratio changes with temperature. The exponential term in the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. Assuming that the energy difference is positive (E2 > E1), so higher energy level is n2. 

If the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term gets smaller. So n2/n1 would decrease as temperature decreases. That makes sense. So when the star has spots and T_eff is lower, the ratio n2/n1 is lower. 

But the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. So we need to calculate (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. So the factor is (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) = (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

But if the ratio decreases, then the factor would be greater than 1.

But let's get into the specifics. We need to calculate the ratio of the ratios.

We have two scenarios: star without spots (T1 = 6000 K) and star with spots (T2 = 5500 K). We'll model each using the Boltzmann equation.

So, the ratio without spots is R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T1) )

Similarly, the ratio with spots is R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T2) )

But the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor is R1/R2.

Let me compute R1/R2:

R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] 

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out. So we have exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is equal to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, let me write that again:

ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. So:

R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because (ΔE/(k T1) is in the exponent as negative, and (ΔE/(k T2) is negative as well. So when you subtract them, it's (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Let me think again about the exponents:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, because:

[ a - b ] = a + (-b) 

So [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) 

Factor out ΔE/(k):

= ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, (1/T2 - 1/T1) is negative because T2 < T1.

Wait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K. So 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1, so (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive.

So, R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) )

But wait, the exponent becomes positive because (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive, and ΔE is positive. So the exp is positive, so R1/R2 is greater than 1.

So the factor is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But how do we find ΔE? The transition corresponds to a wavelength λ of 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon emitted when an electron transitions between them.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / λ.

So ΔE = hc/λ

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So let me compute ΔE:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) 

Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 

1.9878 / 1448 ≈ approx 0.001373 → 1.373e-3 

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-3 * 1e-15 J = 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divided by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 

Wait, because 1e-25 / 1e-10 is 1e-15, but 1.448e-7 is 1.448 *1e-7. So 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18.

So 1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ approx 1.373.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Calculating denominator: 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m.

So (6.626e-34 *3e8) = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373 (as 1.448 *1.373 ≈ 1.9878). 

So yes, ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, another approach: energy in terms of eV.

Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So let's compute ΔE in eV.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.602e-19) eV.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute hc in eV·Å.

Wait, hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å. Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å.

So, λ =1448 Å.

ΔE = hc / λ = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's much easier. So ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, yeah. Because hc = 12400 eV·Å. So in eV, it's 12400 / 1448.

Let me compute that:

12400 ÷ 1448 → Let's see: 1448 * 8 = 11584. 12400 -11584=816. So 8 + (816/1448) → 8 + approximately 0.563 → about 8.563 eV.

Yes, so ΔE ≈8.56 eV.

But let me check that calculation again. 1448 *8 = 11584 as above. 12400 -11584=816. So 816/1448 = 0.563 approx. So 8.563 eV.

So ΔE=8.563 eV.

Now, the Boltzmann factor involves k*T. So let's compute (ΔE)/(k*T) for both temperatures.

But wait, in the exponent, the term is (ΔE)/(k*T). So let's compute that.

k is Boltzmann constant: 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So for each temperature:

At T1=6000 K: (ΔE)/(k*T1) = (8.563 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) 

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *6000 ≈ 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 8.617e-2 → 0.08617 eV.

So 8.563 / 0.08617 ≈ roughly 100. 

Wait, 8.563 / 0.08617 → Let me compute 8.563 ÷ 0.08617.

Well, 8.563 / 0.08617 ≈ 8.563 / 0.086 ≈ around 100.

Wait, 0.086 * 100 = 8.6. So 8.563 is a bit less than 8.6. So 8.563 / 0.086 ≈ 99.56 → approx 99.6.

Similarly, for T2=5500 K:

Denominator: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = 8.617e-2 *5.5 → 0.08617 *5.5 = 0.4739 eV.

So (ΔE)/(k*T2) = 8.563 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.08.

So now, the exponent in R1/R2 is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, earlier I had:

R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But wait, no, earlier I have R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but wait, let me go back: the exponent was (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is (ΔE/(k)) * ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) )

But wait, 1/5500 is approximately 0.0001818, and 1/6000 is 0.00016667.

The difference is approximately 0.00001518.

So (ΔE/(k)) is (8.563 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) → 8.563 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99,362 K.

So (ΔE/(k)) ≈ 99,362 K.

Then multiplying by (1/5500 - 1/6000) → which is 0.00001518.

So 99,362 * 0.00001518 ≈ let me compute that.

Approximately:

99,362 * 0.00001518 → 99,362 * 1.518e-5.

Compute 99,362 * 1.518e-5.

Multiply 99,362 by 1.518e-5:

= (approx) 99,362 * 0.00001518.

Let me compute that:

99,362 * 0.00001 = 0.99362.

99,362 * 0.00000518 = 99,362 * 0.000005 = 0.49681; 99,362 *0.00000018= approx 0.017885.

So 0.49681 + 0.017885 ≈ 0.514695.

So total ≈ 0.99362 + 0.514695 ≈ 1.5083.

Wait, but this can't be right. Because 99,362 * 1.518e-5 is 99,362 * (1.518 * 1e-5) )= 99,362 * 1.518 * 1e-5.

Wait, 99,362 * 1.518 = let's compute that.

99,362 * 1.5 = 149,043.

99,362 * 0.018 = 1,788.516.

Total ≈ 149,043 + 1,788.516 = 150,831.516.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,831.516e-5 → 15.0831516.

So about 15.08.

So the exponent in R1/R2 is approximately 15.08.

So R1/R2 = exp(15.08) → what is that? Let's compute.

We know that exp(10) ≈ 22026, exp(15) is exp(10)*exp(5) ≈ 22026 * 148.413 ≈ approximately 3.26e6.

Wait, but 15.08 is just a bit more than 15. So exp(15.08) ≈ 3.26e6 * exp(0.08).

Exp(0.08) is approximately 1.0833.

So 3.26e6 * 1.0833 ≈ 3.53e6.

So the factor R1/R2 is approximately 3.53e6. But looking at the options, the options are nowhere near that. The options are ~1.1, ~7.8, ~4.5, ~2.9.

Wait, this suggests that I made a mistake somewhere. Because the factor I got is way too big. Let me go back and check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponent signs or the way I applied the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, let me re-express the ratio R1/R2.

Earlier, I thought R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But wait, let me re-derive that.

R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Yes, that's correct.

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Now, let's compute this correctly.

ΔE = 8.563 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.563 / (8.617e-5) → let me compute that.

8.563 / 8.617e-5 → 8.563 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 99,360 K.

Wait, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.

So 8.563 / 0.00008617 ≈ Let me calculate 8.563 ÷ 0.00008617.

Let me compute 8.563 ÷ 0.00008617 → same as 8.563 * (1/0.00008617) → 8.563 * 11607 → approximately 8.563 * 11,607.

Wait, 8 * 11,607 = 92,856. 0.563*11,607 → approx 6,551. So total around 99,407. So about 99,407 K.

Then, (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 99,407 * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Compute 1/5500 = 0.000181818, 1/6000=0.000166667.

Difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

Multiply 99,407 by 0.000015151.

99,407 * 0.000015151 → Let me compute that.

99,407 * 0.00001 = 0.99407.

99,407 * 0.000005151 = ?

0.000005151 is 5.151e-6.

99,407 * 5.151e-6 → approx 99,407 * 5e-6 = 0.497035, and 99,407 * 0.151e-6 = 0.015017.

So total approximately 0.497035 + 0.015017 = 0.51205.

So total is 0.99407 + 0.51205 = 1.50612.

So the exponent is 1.506, approximately.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

Compute e^1.506.

We know that e^1 ≈ 2.718, e^1.6 ≈ 4.953.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

Wait, e^1.506 → a little bit more than 1.5, so let's interpolate.

At x=1.5 → 4.4817.

x=1.6 → 4.953.

The difference between 1.5 and 1.6 is 0.1, which gives about 0.4713 increase.

So for 0.006 above 1.5, which is 6% of 0.1, the increase would be about 0.4713 * 0.06 ≈ 0.028.

So e^1.506 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.028 ≈ 4.5097.

So approximately 4.51.

So the factor is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the populations changes with temperature, and the factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into this expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right)
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the photon emitted during the transition, which is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the factor
The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is \( 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). The temperatures are \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Substituting into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right)
\]

First, compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,360 \, \text{K}
\]

Next, compute \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) \approx 99,360 \cdot 0.0000151 \approx 1.506
\]

Finally, compute the exponential:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.51
\]

### Conclusion
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option **C**.

**Answer: C**
