Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I should remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it's basically the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz too. But wait, if the question says which must be respected by all operators, I need to see which symmetries are necessarily enforced.

SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So SMEFT operators must respect the gauge symmetries of the Standard Model, which include SU(3), SU(2), U(1), etc. But what about other symmetries like Lorentz?

In the Standard Model, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. Since SMEFT is built upon the SM, all SMEFT operators must obey the SM symmetries, including Lorentz. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Poincare symmetry includes translations and Lorentz. But wait, in quantum field theory, Poincare symmetry is the combination. But effective theories, like SMEFT, are usually considered to be Lorentz invariant but not necessarily Poincare? Or do operators in SMEFT respect Poincare? I'm a bit confused. Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars (or tensors, etc., but built to be Lorentz-invariant). So Lorentz symmetry is definitely required. But does this imply that Poincare is necessarily respected?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. Do SMEFT operators have to respect translations? Because SMEFT is constructed in a way that it's a low-energy effective theory, which is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but not necessarily that all terms are translationally invariant. Wait, but in any valid QFT, operators should respect Poincare because the theory is set in Minkowski space. Hmm. But maybe the question is whether
