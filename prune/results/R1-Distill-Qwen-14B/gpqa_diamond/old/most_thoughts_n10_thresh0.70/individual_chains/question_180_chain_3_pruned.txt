Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, I've studied a bit about electric potential energy, so maybe that's what I need here.

Alright, let's read the question again. We have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And all of them have negligible mass, so we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything else besides potential energy.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So I'm picturing point P with one charge, and then 12 charges arranged somewhere on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. Oh, right! Electric potential energy depends on the arrangement of charges. To minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves as close as possible. But since they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, they can't get any closer. So the system's configuration is fixed.

So, the system's potential energy is the work done to bring all these charges together. I think the formula for the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum over all pairs (q_i q_j / r_ij).

Wait, but
