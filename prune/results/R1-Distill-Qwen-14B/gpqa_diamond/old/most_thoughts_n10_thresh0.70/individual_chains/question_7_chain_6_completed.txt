Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I've heard about the CMB before; it's the afterglow of the Big Bang, right? And gamma-rays are high-energy photons, much more energetic than visible light.

The question is about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by the process gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The reaction is γ + γ → e+ + e-. So, the gamma-ray is annihilating with a CMB photon to produce an electron and a positron.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's a really low energy. Makes sense because the CMB is a remnant of the early universe, but it's also redshifted a lot as the universe expanded, so the photons are much cooler now.

So I need to find the gamma-ray energy where this annihilation process limits their lifetime. I think this has to do with the photon density of the CMB and the cross-section for this annihilation process. The idea is that if a gamma-ray has enough energy, it will interact with CMB photons frequently enough that its lifetime in the universe is significantly shortened due to these interactions.

I remember that for such pair production processes, the interaction rate depends on the product of the photon density and the cross-sectional area. The cross-section probably depends on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon.

Wait, the photon density of the CMB is known. The CMB is a blackbody with a temperature of about 2.7 K. The photon number density can be calculated using the formula for a blackbody:

n_γ = (8π g_* )/( (h c^3) (e^{hν/(kT)} - 1) )) * T^3

But since the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV, maybe we can approximate the CMB photon number density using that energy. Wait, but the average energy isn't the same as the temperature, but for a blackbody, the average photon energy is related to the temperature.

Wait, the average energy in a blackbody spectrum is about 2.7 k T, because the average photon energy for a blackbody is about 2.7 times the thermal energy (k T). So, if the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, then k T is approximately 1e-3 eV divided by 2.7. Let me compute that.

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 8.617e-5 eV/K. So, T = (1e-3 eV) / (2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV/K) = let me calculate that.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The average photon energy is about 2.7 k T. So, if the average energy is 1e-3 eV, then 2.7 k T = 1e-3 eV. So T = (1e-3 eV) / (2.7 * k). Let me compute that numerically.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So denominator is 2.7 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 2.32659e-4 eV/K.

So T ≈ (1e-3) / (2.32659e-4) ≈ 4.29 K. Hmm, but I thought the CMB was 2.7 K. Wait, perhaps I mixed up the numbers. Maybe the average photon energy is about 0.74 k T. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the average photon energy for a photon gas is (like for a photon in 3D blackbody): the average energy is <E> = (3/2) k T, because in 3D, each degree of freedom is (1/2 kT), so 3* (1/2 kT) )= 3/2 kT. So <E> = 3/2 k T. So if the average CMB photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, then k T = (1e-3 eV) * (2/3). So (2/3)*1e-3 is about 6.6667e-4 eV.

Then, T = (6.6667e-4 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ (6.6667e-4) / 8.617e-5 ≈ approximately 7.73 K. Hmm, but that doesn't align with what I know about the CMB, which is about 2.7 K. So perhaps the given average photon energy is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the problem says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. Maybe I should just go with that, regardless of the actual CMB temperature. So let's take that given value as correct for this problem.

So, the CMB photon energy is 1e-3 eV.

Now, the process is gamma + photon → e+ + e-.

The cross-section for this process probably depends on the center-of-mass energy. The threshold for producing an electron-positron pair is when the combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2 m_e c^2, where m_e is the electron mass.

The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV. So 2 m_e c^2 is about 1.022 MeV.

So for the pair production to occur, the energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 1.022 MeV.

The problem is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons. So each gamma-ray has energy E_gamma, and the CMB photon has energy E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_photon c)^2 (since photons are massless, their energy is p c). But I'm not sure about the signs. Wait, gamma-rays and CMB photons are moving in opposite directions relative to each other? Or the same? Oh, wait, no, for the annihilation, the two photons must collide head-on, so their momenta are opposite. So the total energy is E_gamma + E_photon, and the total momentum is |p_gamma - p_photon| if they're moving in opposite directions. But I'm not sure, maybe it's |p_gamma + p_photon| if they're moving in the same direction? No, no, wait. Let's think about frame where one photon is moving along +x and the other along -x.

Wait, the initial photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum is (p_gamma - p_photon) if the photon is moving in the opposite direction. So the square of the center-of-mass energy is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

But since for photons, E = p c, so E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c. Let's assume that the gamma-ray is much more energetic than the CMB photon, so E_gamma >> E_photon. Then E_photon is about 1e-3 eV, E_gamma is like 1e5 GeV, which is 1e14 eV. So E_gamma is way bigger than E_photon.

So, E_total = E_gamma + E_photon ≈ E_gamma.

Momentum: Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are p_gamma and p_photon in opposite directions. So the net momentum is p_gamma - p_photon. But since E_photon = p_photon c, and E_gamma = p_gamma c, and E_gamma >> E_photon,

p_gamma = E_gamma/(c) >> E_photon/(c) = p_photon.

So, p_gamma ≈ E_gamma/(c), and p_photon ≈ E_photon/(c).

So the net momentum is E_gamma/(c) - E_photon/(c) ≈ E_gamma/(c).

Then, the center-of-mass energy squared is:

s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma/(c) - E_photon/(c))^2 c^2.

Wait, but let's compute this correctly. Let me write (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

But since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, this becomes:

(E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c) - (E2/c) )^2 c^2.

So E = E1 + E2, and p = (E1/c - E2/c) = (E1 - E2)/c.

So s = E^2 - (p c)^2 = E^2 - ( (E1 - E2) )^2.

Expanding that:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Which is (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So, s = 4 E1 E2.

Wait, that's an interesting result. So the square of the center-of-mass energy is four times the product of the two photon energies, because the photons are moving in opposite directions.

So s = (4 E_gamma E_photon ) → sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt( E_gamma E_photon )

The threshold condition is when sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c^2.

So,

2 sqrt( E_gamma E_photon ) = 2 m_e c^2 → sqrt( E_gamma E_photon ) = m_e c^2.

Square both sides:

E_gamma E_photon = (m_e c^2)^2.

Then,

E_gamma = (m_e c^2 )^2 / E_photon.

Given that E_photon is the average CMB photon energy, which is 1e-3 eV, so:

E_gamma = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV).

Let me compute that.

First, convert all units to eV.

0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So,

E_gamma = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV ) = (0.511e6)^2 * 1e3 (eV^2) / eV = 0.511^2 * 1e12 * 1e3 eV.

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, (0.511e6 eV)^2 is (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261 * 1e12 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV: (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV.

But wait, let me compute this step by step.

(0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261121 * 1e12 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV:

0.261121e12 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 0.261121e15 eV.

0.261121e15 eV is 2.61121e14 eV.

Wait, because 0.261121e15 = 2.61121e14.

So E_gamma is approximately 2.6e14 eV.

But the options are in GeV. So 2.6e14 eV is equal to 2.6e8 GeV, since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the exponents.

Wait, no. 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 1 eV is 1e-9 GeV.

So 2.6e14 eV = 2.6e14 * 1e-9 GeV = 2.6e5 GeV.

Oh, wait, no: wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV → 1 eV = 1e-9 GeV.

So 2.6e14 eV = 2.6e14 * 1e-9 GeV = 2.6e5 GeV. So 2.6e5 GeV is 260,000 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Another way: 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. Squared, that gives (511,000)^2 eV².

Divide by 0.001 eV: (511,000)^2 / 0.001 = (511,000)^2 * 1e3.

Compute 511,000 squared: 511,000^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61121e11.

Multiply by 1e3: 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61121e5 GeV ≈ 2.6e5 GeV.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer is option C, 2.6e5 GeV.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the threshold condition for pair production. The reaction requires the center-of-mass energy in the $\gamma\gamma$ system to be at least $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass ($m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$). 

For two photons moving in opposite directions, the center-of-mass energy squared is given by:

\[
s = 4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}},
\]

where $E_\gamma$ is the energy of the gamma-ray and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ is the energy of the CMB photon. At the threshold, $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, so:

\[
\sqrt{s} = 2m_e c^2.
\]

Equating $\sqrt{s}$ to $2m_e c^2$, we find:

\[
\sqrt{4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}} = 2m_e c^2.
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\sqrt{E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}} = m_e c^2.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} = (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Solving for $E_\gamma$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, we compute:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV}.
\]

First, calculate $(0.511 \times 10^6)^2$:

\[
(0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2 / 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} / 10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the energy of the gamma-rays is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.**
