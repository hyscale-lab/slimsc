Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, right, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. I remember that phosphate has multiple dissociation steps because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The Ka values are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So, each dissociation step is much weaker than the previous.

The substances here are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out their dissociations.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But we need the concentration of PO4^3-.

Hmm, wait. Maybe the presence of both these salts will buffer the solution. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-. But under what conditions?

The pH of the solution will determine where the phosphate species are. Since we have both KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-), the solution is probably buffered between pH around where H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-. How much of that is present?

I think I need to calculate the concentrations of each phosphate species and then see which is the dominant form, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, maybe I can approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the buffer system.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid would be H2PO4^- and the base would be HPO4^2- because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

But wait, the relevant pKa here is Ka2, since that's the second dissociation (H2PO4^- → HPO4
