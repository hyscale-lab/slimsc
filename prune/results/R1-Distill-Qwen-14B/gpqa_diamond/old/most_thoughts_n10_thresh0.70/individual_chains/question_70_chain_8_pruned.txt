Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions, and the final part is about the molecular symmetry of product E. The options are symmetry groups, so I'm guessing E has a specific shape that corresponds to one of these.

Let me start by going through each reaction to figure out what each substance might be.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. I'm thinking metals reacting with something. Wait, maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen? Because sometimes metals react with halogens in specific ratios. But 8 equivalents is a lot. Alternatively, maybe it's sulfur reacting with something? Wait, another thought: if A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2), then Na reacts with Cl2 in 1:1 ratio to form NaCl. But that's not 8 equivalents. Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum and B is something else? Wait, another approach: the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like copper(II) compounds. Or maybe lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown, not red. Wait, another idea: I remember that when copper reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid, it can produce copper sulfate, water, and sulfur dioxide. But that's a different setup. Wait, product C is bright red. Oh! Maybe it's lead(II,IV) oxide, Pb3O4, which is reddish. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different oxide. Or perhaps it's not an oxide at all. Another thought: maybe product C is a sulfide or something else. Wait, maybe solid A is a metal that forms a red product when reacted with a diatomic gas. Oh! What about sodium reacting with something? No. Wait, maybe A is aluminum, and B is fluorine. Aluminum and fluorine react in a 1:3 ratio, but 8 equivalents is 8 times the molar amount. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is sodium and B is chlorine. Because 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na, but that doesn't make sense because sodium typically reacts in a 1:1
