Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets can't have isolated poles; they come in pairs. That's because of the divergence of the magnetic field being zero. Oh right, Maxwell's equations! Let me think through each equation.

So Maxwell's equations are four in total. The first one is Gauss's law for electricity: divergence of E equals rho over epsilon. The second is Gauss's law for magnetism: divergence of B is zero. The third is Faraday's law of induction, involving the curl of E. And the fourth is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, involving the curl of B.

In our universe, because you can't have isolated magnetic poles, the divergence of B is zero. So equation two is ∇·B = 0. But the question says in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So that would mean that equation two isn't zero anymore. So equation two would change.

Wait, but the question is about which equations are different. Let me look at the options. Option A says the divergence of the magnetic field is different. So equation two would be different. But wait, what about the other equations?

Faraday's law is about the curl of E. It's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. That doesn't directly depend on the presence of isolated poles. Ampère's law with Maxwell's term is about ∇×B, which relates to the current and displacement current. That depends on currents, not isolated poles.

Wait, but in our universe, because you can't have isolated magnetic charges, the divergence of B is zero. If in this universe, you can have isolated magnetic charges, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. So equation two, Gauss's law for magnetism, would change.

So the equations that are different would be the ones where the magnetic monopoles come into play. Which equations involve that?

Looking at the options, option A is about the divergence of B. So equation two would be different. But maybe the other equations are the ones that change. Wait, another thought: Maxwell added the displacement current term to Ampère's law to make it consistent with Maxwell's equations, especially for wave propagation. But that doesn't directly tie into magnetic monopoles.

Wait, in reality, the equations are:
1. ∇·E
