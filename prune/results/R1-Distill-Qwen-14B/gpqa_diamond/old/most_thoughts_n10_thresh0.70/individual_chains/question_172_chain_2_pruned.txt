Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the usual equations from that apply.

Wait, when atoms are excited, I think it's related to the Boltzmann distribution. Because in thermal equilibrium, the population of energy levels depends on temperature. The Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The formula I remember is the ratio of populations of two states: (n2)/(n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

So in this case, the problem says that the excited state in star_1 has twice the population of the same state in star_2. So let's think: for star_1, the population is n1, for star_2, it's n2. So n1 (star_1) = 2 * n2 (star_2). 

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So maybe the excitation level refers to the population of a higher energy state. Let me clarify.

So, the ratio would be (n_upper in star1)/(n_upper in star2) = 2. But wait, alternatively, if the question is about the ratio of excitation for a specific level, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state? Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited population in each star. I'm a bit confused, but I think the key is the ratio of their populations.

So, for each star, the population of the excited state is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state population to the lower state is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where
