Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, the problem says that an organic chemist did two reactions. Reaction I and Reaction II. Then, after both are done, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks they observe in each.

Let me break down each reaction first.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one is a ketone at position 3, so when reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol at position 3. Wait, but wait, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it properly. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH(O)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, hexane has six carbons. So, 3-one is CH2CH2CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3, with the ketone at carbon 3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, wait, hexane is six carbons. So, positions are 1-6. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait, let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no: the correct structure is CH2
