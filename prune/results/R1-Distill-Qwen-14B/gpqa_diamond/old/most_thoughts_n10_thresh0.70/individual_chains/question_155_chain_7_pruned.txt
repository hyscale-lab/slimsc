Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem talks about an operator P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which is important because that tells me the basis in which the matrices are expressed.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz.

Uncertainty, right. I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for Pz, I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

First, I think I should compute the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩. That's the average value you'd expect if you measured Pz many times on this state. Then ⟨Pz²⟩ is the expectation value of Pz squared. Once I have both, plug them into the formula.

But wait, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, I need to multiply the state vector (which is a column vector) by the Pz matrix, and then take the inner product. Or wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose (bra) multiplied by the operator and then the ket vector. So ⟨Pz⟩ = ψ† Pz ψ.

Let me write down the given state vector. The state is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So as a row vector (bra), it's ψ† = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

The Pz matrix is given as:
First row: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Second row: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Third row: [ 0, 0, -ħ ]

So Pz is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

Hmm, so when I do ψ† Pz ψ, that's the sum over the components multiplied by the corresponding Pz elements.

Let me compute each term. Each element in ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of Pz and then summed.

Wait, actually, when you have a diagonal matrix, the product ψ† Pz ψ is the sum of the squares of the components of ψ multiplied by their respective diagonal elements.

So each component i in ψ is multiplied by the diagonal element Pz_ii, then squared, and summed.

So, let's compute each term:

First component: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2)
Wait, wait no. Wait, matrix multiplication for ψ† Pz would be [ψ₁* Pz_11 + ψ₂* Pz_22 + ψ₃* Pz_33].

Since Pz is diagonal, all the off-diagonal terms are zero.

So ψ† Pz is [ (-1/2) * ħ, (1/√2) * 0, (-1/2)* (-ħ) ] as a row vector. Then ψ† Pz ψ is the inner product of that with ψ.

Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute it step by step.

Let me write the state ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2,
        1/√2,
        -1/2 ]

Pz is diagonal, so ψ† Pz is [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ] which is [ (-ħ/2), 0, (ħ/2) ].

Then, ψ† Pz ψ is the inner product of this row vector with ψ.

So:

( (-ħ/2) * (-1/2) ) + (0 * 1/√2 ) + ( (ħ/2) * (-1/2) )

Let's compute each term:

First term: ( ħ/2 ) * (1/2 ) = ħ/(4)
Second term: 0
Third term: ( ħ/2 ) * (-1/2) = - ħ/(4)

Adding together: [ ħ/4 - ħ/4 ] = 0.

Wait, that's zero. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the average value of Pz is zero. Then what about ⟨
