Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Let me read it again.

The question describes an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside it, not at the center because the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. 

The options are all expressions for E, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, so I'm a bit rusty on conductor charges and electric fields. Let me think. The conductor is initially uncharged, but then a charge is placed inside the cavity. What happens in such a setup?

I remember something about charges inducing surface charges. When a conductor has a cavity and a charge inside, the inner surface of the conductor (the part inside the cavity) must have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the charge inside. Wait, no, wait. The conductor was initially uncharged. So the total charge of the conductor is zero. When you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have a charge -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Because the conductor can't have an internal electric field.

So the inner surface charge is -q. Then, since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total charge of the conductor is the sum of inner and outer surface charges. So inner is -q, outer is +q, total zero.

But wait, the conductor was uncharged before placing the charge, so the entire charge comes from the charge placed inside. So the conductor's net charge is zero. The inner surface has -q, outer has +q.

Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor at point P? Since the point is outside, the outer surface's charge would contribute. But wait, the outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so the field outside should be as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center. Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity. The presence of the cavity's inner charge affects the inner surface but the outer surface behaves as if the charge is at the center. So the field outside would be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor, right?

But wait, the point
