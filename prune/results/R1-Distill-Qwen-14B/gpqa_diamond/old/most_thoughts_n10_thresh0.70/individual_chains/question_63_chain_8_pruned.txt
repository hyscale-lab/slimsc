Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, right, the non-rigid rotor model—so this is about the rotational and vibrational states of the molecule. But the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. I remember that in such cases, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between two states.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in quantum mechanics, molecules can have different modes of excitation—rotation and vibration. I think the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model are a combination of both rotational and vibrational states.

But wait, when the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, how does a photon cause it to transition? Maybe the photon provides energy to either the rotational or vibrational part. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So that would be the next higher energy state, which would probably involve moving to the next vibrational state or the next rotational state.

Wait, the fundamental state in a diatomic molecule is usually the vibrational ground state with rotational quantum number J=
