Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A, and the options are given as A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to understand the setup. Annihilation typically involves a particle and its antiparticle annihilating each other, producing other particles. Here, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. They annihilate to produce four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Wait, but wait, A⁺ and A⁻ would be a particle and antiparticle pair, so each has the same mass but opposite charge. So, in total, four particles, but each A has the same mass, which is given as 300 MeV. 

Wait, but wait, the initial state is a proton and an antiproton. Their rest masses are about the same, right? The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c², so the antiproton would have the same mass. So the initial rest mass would be around 1876 MeV (938 + 938). But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so the initial state isn't at rest, but the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low speed? Or maybe the system's total energy is considered.

Wait, wait, no
