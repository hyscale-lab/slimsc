Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember that equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. The question is about the conditions under which the equation is valid.

Let me think. The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. I think that's when the current is limited by the build-up of charge in the space-charge region rather than other factors like ohmic resistance or series resistance. So in that case, the electric field is modulated by the charge itself.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. Wait, ε is the dielectric constant, μ is carrier mobility, and L is the device length. Right, I remember the derivation involves some integration of the field and the resulting current due to the space-charge effect.

Now, the question is about which statement is correct regarding the validity of the equation. Let's look at the options.

Option A: The equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate the picture, leading to more complex behavior. Single-carrier suggests only electrons or holes are involved. Ohmic contact implies that the contacts don't cause significant barrier to carriers, so the current is determined by the bulk properties. But wait, the SCLC regime is when the current is limited by the space charge, so maybe the contacts aren't the main issue. Ohmic contacts might not affect the space-charge limit. Also, negligible drift current—wait, drift is due to electric field. If drift current is negligible, then maybe the current is dominated by something else. But in SCLC, the current is mainly due to drift, right? So I'm a bit confused about this. Maybe not.

Option B: The equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. So no injection barrier—maybe meaning it's an Ohmic contact again. Negligible diffusion—so current is dominated by drift. That sounds more in line with SCLC because in SCLC, the current is due to drift under an electric field that's affected by the space charge. So diffusion is usually considered when there's a concentration gradient, but in space-charge-limited, perhaps drift is dominant. So B is a possibility.

Option C: Valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contact implies a barrier, so maybe that affects the current. But the Mott-Gurney equation is about the space-charge-limited region, which depends more on the bulk and the built-in field. So the contact type (Ohmic vs Schottky) might influence the initial conditions but perhaps not the regime itself. Also, the equation's validity might not depend much on the contact type as much as on whether the current is limited by space charge. Hmm, but I'm not sure. I'd have to think about whether the contact affects the space-charge limit.

Option D: It's for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion. Two-carrier devices (like both electrons and holes contributing) would have a different model, maybe the Fowler-Nordheim equation or something else. Mott-Gurney is for single carrier, I think. So D is probably incorrect.

So, back to options. The key points are: single-carrier, trap-free, and the type of current (drift vs diffusion).

In SCLC, the current is primarily due to the drift of carriers under an electric field, which is established by the space-charge. So if the diffusion current is negligible, that aligns with SCLC. Also, if there's no trap, that simplifies things because traps would cause more scattering and possibly change the mobility or the current behavior.

So looking at option B: No carrier injection barrier—so the carriers can move freely, perhaps implying an Ohmic contact. Or maybe it's a different way of saying that there's no barrier for movement in the device. And negligible diffusion current. So this would fit, because in SCLC, the current is dominated by drift, hence diffusion is considered negligible.

Option A says negligible drift current. That doesn't make sense because SCLC is when the current is dominated by drift. So A is incorrect.

So between B and C. Option B says no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion. Option C says Schottky contact.

Wait, what's a Schottky contact? It's a type of metal-semiconductor contact where the work function difference leads to a barrier. So if it's a Schottky contact, there's a barrier for carriers. But in the Mott-Gurney equation, the barriers at the contacts are not the limiting factor. The equation is about the bulk, so the actual presence of a Schottky might not affect the SCLC condition as long as the space charge is building up. But I'm not sure if the contact type (Ohmic vs Schottky) affects the validity of the equation.

Wait, another angle: the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is limited by the space charge in the bulk, so the contacts must be such that the injection is efficient. If the contacts are Ohmic, then the carriers can easily enter and exit, so the space charge builds up in the bulk. If it's a Schottky contact, maybe it's harder for carriers to inject, which would affect the current. But wait, the equation is for the SCLC region, which is when the space charge is the dominant factor. So maybe the contact type doesn't matter as long as the space charge is building up. So perhaps the equation holds regardless of contact type, as long as the space charge conditions are met.

But looking back at the options. Option B says the device has no carrier injection barrier. No injection barrier would allow easy movement of carriers, so perhaps this is the condition for the current to be determined by the bulk properties, not the contacts. So then, the equation would apply here because the current is limited by space charge, not by the contact barriers.

Alternatively, if the device had a Schottky contact, you might have a higher barrier, which could influence the space charge, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain assumptions. Let me think about the derivation. The derivation assumes that the current is due to the space charge effect, which comes into play when the electric field is such that the space charge (electron density) creates a region where the field is modified enough to limit the current. So in this scenario, the contacts are such that carrier injection is efficient—so they don't impede the flow. So the equation applies when the contacts are Ohmic, because Ohmic contacts don't have a barrier, allowing carriers to flow more freely, thus making the space charge the limiting factor.

Wait, but in a Schottky contact, you have a barrier. If the barrier is high, maybe the current is limited by injection, not by space charge. So if the device has a Schottky contact, then the current might not reach the space-charge limited region because the carriers can't inject easily. So the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the injection is efficient, meaning the contacts are Ohmic. Or in other words, when there are no injection barriers.

So with that in mind, looking at the options again.

Option B says no carrier injection barrier, which would allow for efficient injection, making the space charge the limiting factor. So the equation would be valid.

Option C has a Schottky contact, which implies a barrier, so maybe the equation doesn't apply because the current is limited by the contact, not space charge.

So I'm leaning towards option B as correct.

Another point: the equation is for single carrier. So options A, B, C all have single, D is two. So D is out.

Option B: trap-free (so no recombination centers), single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic contact), negligible diffusion current. That makes sense because in SCLC, the current is mainly from drift, so diffusion is negligible.

So the correct statement is B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime in semiconductor devices, where the current is limited by the build-up of charge in the space-charge region. The equation is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where \( \epsilon \) is the dielectric constant, \( \mu \) is the carrier mobility, and \( L \) is the device length. The validity of the equation depends on specific conditions being met.

### Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, in the SCLC regime, drift current is the dominant mechanism, not negligible. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. In the SCLC regime, the current is dominated by drift, and diffusion is negligible. Additionally, the absence of a carrier injection barrier (implying efficient carrier injection) aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. This option is consistent with the conditions under which the equation holds.

- **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier, which could limit carrier injection and prevent the current from reaching the SCLC regime. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.

- **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, not two-carrier devices. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (efficient carrier injection) and negligible diffusion current, as described in **Option B**.
