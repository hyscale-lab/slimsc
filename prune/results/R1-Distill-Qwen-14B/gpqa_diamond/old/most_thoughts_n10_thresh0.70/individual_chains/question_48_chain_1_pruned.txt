Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So the structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Then it's treated with bromine, which is Br2. I think when ketones react with bromine, it's usually an addition reaction. Wait, but ketones don't add bromine like alkenes do. Oh wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's an enolate formation or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Cyclohexanone has a cyclic structure. When treated with bromine, perhaps it undergoes a bromination. But where? Oh wait, maybe it's an example of the benzilic acid rearrangement or something else. No, maybe not. Another possibility is that the bromine adds across the carbonyl group. Oh, but adding Br2 to a ketone... I'm a bit stuck. Oh wait, I think that when ketones react with bromine, particularly in a cyclic structure, it can form a bromohydrin. But wait, in the presence of something else, maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dihydroxylation? No, that's for alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via the enol. Wait, cyclohexanone can form an enol under certain conditions. When you add bromine, perhaps it adds to the
