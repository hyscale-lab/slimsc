Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the problem states that a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. The observation point is r, and d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to r. The velocity at the generating time is v.

I remember that the potentials are calculated based on retarded time, right? Because the fields and potentials propagate at the speed of light. So the potentials depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time, not the current one.

The scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law divided by the permittivity and distance, but with some corrections if the charge is moving. Wait, no, for static charges, V is straightforward, but when the charge is moving, maybe there's a relativistic correction or something involving the velocity.

Wait, wait. I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is similar to the static case but scaled by some factor. Oh, right! The scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (v/c²) * t')) ), but wait, I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, I remember that when a charge is moving, there's a term involving the velocity. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the retarded time. The retarded time tr is the time when the charge's position's influence reaches the observer at time t. So, the retarded time is t_r = t - (r · d)/c², or something like that. Wait, no, more precisely, the retarded time is when the effect started propagating. So if the charge is at position r' at time t_r, then the field at r at time t is based on the charge's state at t_r.

Wait, maybe I should recall the expressions for the potentials in the case of a moving charge. The scalar potential V(r, t) is given by:

V(r, t) = (q / (4πε₀)) * (1 /
