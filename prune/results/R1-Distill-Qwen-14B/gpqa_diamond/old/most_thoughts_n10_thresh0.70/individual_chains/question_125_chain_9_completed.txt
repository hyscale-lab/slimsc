Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, which is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator, but in three dimensions. So I remember that this is similar to the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator problem.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. The options are A to D, but I'm not going to look at them yet; I want to think through it.

First, I need to recall how the energy levels work for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. In 3D, each degree of freedom (x, y, z) contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). Since it's isotropic, all directions are the same, so the total energy is the sum of each direction's energy. So the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but another way to think about it is that in 3D, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is (n + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2), so adding them, it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, which is (n + 3/2) ħω. So that's the formula I should use.

Now, the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state? The ground state is the lowest energy, which would be n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0), energy (3/2) ħω. First excited state would be n=1, then n=2, then n=3. So the third excited state is n=3. Because the ground is n=0 (0th), first is n=1, second n=2, third n=3.

So the energy for n=3 would be (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That part seems clear. So looking at the options, the energy would be (9/2) ħω. Let me check the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10.

Option C: same energy, 3. Hmm, so maybe A and C have the correct energy. The other options have different energy expressions, so I can probably eliminate B and D.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions (eigenstates) have this energy? That depends on the degeneracy of the energy level n=3.

The degeneracy is the number of distinct quantum states with the same energy. In 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy for a given n is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Let me think: for n=0, it's (0+1)(0+2)/2 = 1*2/2=1, which is correct because n=0 is non-degenerate. For n=1, (1+1)(1+2)/2=2*3/2=3. So for n=1, there are 3 states. That makes sense because n=1 can be (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), but wait, no, that's three states. Hmm, but wait, I think the formula might not be correct. Let me think again.

Another approach: For each n, the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. So for n=3, it would be (3+1)(3+2)/2 =4*5/2=10. So degeneracy is 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

So looking back, the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. So the option that matches is option A: (9/2) ħω, 10.

Wait, but let me make sure about the degeneracy formula. Another way of thinking: the number of ways to write n as n_x + n_y + n_z, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. So for n=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) sum to 3?

The number is equal to the combination with repetition: (n + 3 -1) choose (3-1) ), which is (3+2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. Yes, that's correct. So the degeneracy is 10.

So the answer should be option A: (9/2) ħω, 10.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively.

The third excited state corresponds to $n = 3$, since the ground state is $n = 0$, the first excited state is $n = 1$, the second excited state is $n = 2$, and the third excited state is $n = 3$. Substituting $n = 3$ into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the energy level for $n = 3$ is determined. The degeneracy corresponds to the number of distinct quantum states with the same energy, which is the number of ways to write $n = 3$ as $n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. This is equivalent to the combinatorial problem of distributing $n$ indistinguishable items into $3$ distinguishable bins, which is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

For $n = 3$, the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy is $10$.

From the given options:
- Option A matches the energy $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and the degeneracy $10$.
- Option C has the correct energy but an incorrect degeneracy of $3$.
- Options B and D have incorrect energy expressions.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
