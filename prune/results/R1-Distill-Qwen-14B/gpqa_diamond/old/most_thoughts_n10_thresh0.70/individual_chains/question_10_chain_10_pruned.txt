Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. The options are A, B, C, D, each corresponding to a choice a, b, c, d.

Wait, so the options are labeled as the choices a to d, and the answer options are letters A to D, each mapping to a, b, c, d. I need to make sure I don't mix them up.

The question lists four different exoplanet scenarios. Let me go through each one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. Let me recall, Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So that's a starting point.

Option b) is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, so it's more massive but same density as Earth. Hmm, so if density is mass divided by volume, then a more massive object with same density would have a larger volume. But in this case, the density is given, so maybe it's just about comparing that value. But let me think deeper.

Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. So same composition implies same density? Because composition affects density—if it's same, then density would be same as Earth's. So density would be 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, if the mass is five times Earth's, then the volume would be (5)^(1/3) times Earth's radius, approximately 1.7 times, since mass scales with volume (radius cubed), and density is mass/volume. So if density is same, mass is 5, volume would be 5/5.5 * Earth's volume, wait no, wait.

Wait, density is mass divided by volume. If the planet has same composition, same density as Earth, which is 5.5. So for option c, density is 5.5. Same as a and b, but wait no— a is Earth's density, and b is 5.5 as well. So how do these options compare? Let me think.

Wait, the
