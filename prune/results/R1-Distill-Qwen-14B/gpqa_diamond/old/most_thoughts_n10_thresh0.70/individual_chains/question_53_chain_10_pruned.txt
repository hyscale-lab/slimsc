Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an ester functional group present. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen connected to an alkyl group. So, the structure probably has an ester somewhere attached to the benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum data, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic protons. A benzene ring with two substituents usually leads to certain types of symmetry. If it's di-substituted and the substituents are in a para arrangement, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, if they are in an ortho or meta arrangement, the symmetry might be different. Wait, but the aromatic protons in this case are two signals, so perhaps the substituents are in a para position. Because in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two equivalent sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are para, each substituent is adjacent to two equivalent protons on each side, so you might see two doublets or singlets. Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho, the ring might have more complex splitting, perhaps more signals. Hmm, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H. So, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that create two distinct sets of protons. So, perhaps each substituent is attached opposite each other, leading to two sets of H, each equivalent.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. A vinyl proton is typically part of a double bond, like in an ethylene group. The signals are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Wait, a doublet of quartets suggests that each vinyl proton is split into four and then into a doublet. Maybe that's from coupling with two neighboring protons, but I'm not too sure about that right now. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a substituent like a CH2CH2 group or something with splitting from adjacent groups.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So, there are two different methyl groups. Because they're separate signals, their environments must be different. So, maybe each methyl is attached to different parts of the molecule, perhaps to different substituents on the benzene ring.

And importantly, there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So, the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. That suggests that any substituents on the benzene ring don't have CH2 in their structures. So, substituents could be methyl groups or perhaps something like an ester group where the oxygen is connected directly to another group without CH2.

Let me think about the ester group. An ester is usually R-O-CO-R'. In this case, the di-substituted benzene would have two substituents, one of which is an ester group. So, maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is a methyl group or something else. Or perhaps both substituents are ester groups, but that might complicate things.

Wait, the IR shows an ester, so the substituents could include an ester. Let me consider the possible structures. Since the aromatic ring is di-substituted, maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is something else. But the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, perhaps the ester has a methyl group attached. So, the ester could be something like O-CO-OCH3 (but that's a carbonate, not an ester. Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R', so maybe the substituent is an ester group where R is, say, a methyl group. For example, the substituent could be a methyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH3? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the substituent could be a phenyl ester, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again. The vinyl protons are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are often part of alkenes. So maybe the substituents include an ethenyl (vinyl) group. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Or maybe the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so each substituent might be an ester group and a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group and the other is a methyl group attached via an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the
