Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. Alright, the question says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. And then there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm, what does all this mean?

First, I remember that aromatic protons show up in the 6.5-8.5 ppm region. Since there are two singlets around 6.7, each singlet probably corresponds to a set of equivalent aromatic protons. And because the ratio is 1:1, each aromatic compound contributes one singlet. So each compound must have only one type of aromatic proton. That would mean each is highly symmetrical, maybe like a para-substituted benzene or something with equivalent protons.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14: 2n +2 = 2*10 +2 =22. So Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 4. So that's four degrees: a benzene ring (which accounts for three DoU) and one more, which would be a double bond or a ring. But since it's an aromatic compound, probably a benzene ring and maybe another substituent with a ring or a double bond. Wait, tetramethylbenzenes would have a benzene with four methyl groups. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, the options are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5. So both have four methyl groups.
Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.
Option C: 1,2,3,5 and diethyl.
Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C8H12, right? Because benzene is C6H6, two ethyl groups add C2H5 each. So ethyl: 2*(C2H5) would be C4H10. So C6 + C4 = C10? No, wait benzene is C6H6, add two ethyl groups (each is C2H5). So each ethyl brings 2 carbons. Two ethyls: 4 C, so total C6 +4= C10. The formula would be C10H14? Wait, benzene has 6 C, each ethyl is CH2CH3. So for two ethyl groups, we have 2*(2 C)=4 C added. So total C6+4= C10. Hydrogen: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group has 5 H (since each is CH2CH3, which is 2+3=5 H per group), so two ethyls would be 10 H. So total H is 6 +10 =16? Wait, but the molecular formula here is C10H14. Oh wait, benzene with two ethyl groups: the formula would be C8H10? Because each ethyl is -CH2CH3, so each adds two C and five H. Wait, no. Benzene is C6H6. Adding two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) contributes 2*(CH2CH3) = C2H7? So 6 C +2 C=8 C, 6 H +7 H=13 H
