Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO reacts with a series of reagents: first, NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. The NMR data is provided, and we need to identify the final product from the given options.

First, I need to figure out what the starting compound is based on the NMR data. Let me look at the NMR peaks:

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's quite upfield for an aldehyde proton, but wait, no—wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or maybe a triplet if coupled with something. Wait, but in this case, it's a triplet. Could it be an aldehyde with some coupling? Or maybe a ketone? No, ketones don't have protons. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like an aromatic -OH? But those usually show up broader, around 5 ppm or lower. Wait, but the peak here is at 9.72, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Or perhaps an aromatic proton in a conjugated system?

Wait, wait. Let me think about the integration and splitting. So 9.72, triplet, 1H. So maybe it's an aldehyde, but why a triplet? Because it's coupling with two neighboring protons. Or perhaps it's not an aldehyde then. Another possibility is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, but that might have a different splitting.

Alternatively, could it be an aromatic ring with some substitution that's causing this peak? Like a coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, but aromatic protons usually are in the range of 6.5-8.
