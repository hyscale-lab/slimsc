Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think about what each part is saying.

Alright, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, which have a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, the spots are at 5000 K? I think that's right because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000.

The question is about photometric observations. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, as the star rotates, the spots will come into and go out of view. This will cause brightness variations because the spots are darker. But the interesting part is that these variations can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. So, the problem is asking: what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same change in brightness (the same amplitude) as these spots do. But this is under the condition that the star isn't covered by spots, so we're comparing the planet's effect to the spot effect.

The options are A to D, with various Rpl/Rstar ratios.

Wait, the question says "To produce the same amplitude signal... what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star?" So, the star's light curve would dip when the planet transits in front, and we're comparing that dip's amplitude to the dip caused by the spots.

So first, I'll need to calculate the amplitude variation caused by the spots, and then find what planet radius would cause the same dip.

I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk compared to the star's. That's the transit method for finding exoplanets.

But wait, the spots are a bit different. They're not covering the entire star, just parts. So the variation in brightness depends on how much of the star's surface is covered by spots, and the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star.

Oh right, the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. The variation in brightness is the difference between when the spots are visible (as the star rotates) and when they're not.

So, to calculate the brightness variation due to the spots, I think the formula involves the filling factor and the temperature difference.

Wait, the brightness from a star is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But when part of the star is cooler, the total brightness from that area is less.

So, when the spots are facing us, the observed flux F is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. When the star isn't spotted (from our view), we see the full flux.

So, the flux without any spots on the visible hemisphere would be F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (Rstar^2 * (pi (1 - f) + f * (Ts/Teff)^4 )) / (4d^2) ), but maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the change in flux when the spots are present.

The change in flux (delta F) when the spots are visible compared to when they're not is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux. Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view and then go out. The amplitude is the difference between the flux when spots are visible and when they're not, divided by the total flux.

Alternatively, the fractional change in brightness (delta F / F0) would be (F_spotted - F_unspotted)/F0.

Wait, no. Think again: F_unspotted is when no spots are visible. F_spotted is when the spots are visible. So the change is F_spotted minus F_unspotted. Because when spots are visible, the flux is lower. So delta F is negative, but the amplitude is the absolute value, I guess.

Wait, let me clarify. The star's total flux is F = F0 * ( (1 - f) + f*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) / (1), assuming that the spots cover a fraction f of the hemisphere. Because when the spots are on the side facing us, their contribution is less.

Wait, when the star isn't spotted, F = F0. When the spots are visible, F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ].

So the change in flux is delta F = F_spotted - F_unspotted = F0 [ (1 - f) + f*(Ts^4 / Teff^4) - 1 ].

Simplify that: delta F = F0 [ -f + f*(Ts^4 / Teff^4) ) ] = F0 * f ( Ts^4 / Teff^4 - 1 )

Wait, Ts is T_spot = 5000 K, Teff is 6000 K.

So, Ts^4 / Teff^4 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

0.8333^2 is about 0.6944. Then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So Ts^4 / Teff^4 ≈ 0.4823.

Then, Ts^4 / Teff^4 -1 = 0.4823 -1 = -0.5177.

So delta F = F0 * f * (-0.5177 )

Hmm, since delta F is negative, the amplitude is the magnitude, so the fractional change would be |delta F| / F0 = f * 0.5177.

Wait, no, wait. Because F_spotted is less than F_unspotted, so the brightness decreases. The amplitude of the variation is the difference between when the spots are fully visible (minimum brightness) and when they're not (maximum brightness). So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Which would be (1 - [ (1-f) + f*(Ts^4 / Teff^4) ] ) = 1 - [ (1-f) + f*(0.4823) ] = 1 - [ 1 -f + 0.4823 f ] = 1 - 1 + f (1 - 0.4823) ) = f * 0.5177.

So the fractional change is f * (1 - (Ts^4 / Teff^4 )).

Wait, but wait, filling factor is f=0.2, so 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots.

So the maximum amplitude (the difference between when the spots are facing us and when they're not) is 0.2 * (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% change in brightness.

Wait, but wait, the star is a sphere, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, covering 20% of the hemisphere. But when the other hemisphere is facing us, those spots are hidden. So the brightness variation would be the same as if the spots were on one side.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. Because each hemisphere is 50% of the total surface area. So if one hemisphere has 20% spots, that would be 10% of the total surface. But I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So on that hemisphere, 20% is spots, 80% is normal. The other hemisphere is entirely normal.

So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total spotted area is 20% of that hemisphere. So since each hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area of spots is 0.2 * 0.5 * R^2 = 0.1 R^2.

Wait, but when the star rotates and the other hemisphere comes into view, the spots are on the far side. So the maximum area covered is 0.1 R^2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's total surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So if one hemisphere has 20% spots, that's 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R² of spots. When that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, so the area blocked is 0.4 π R². But that's when the spots are fully in front of us.

Wait, that's not right. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is 2πR², 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R², which is the area of the spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots block 0.4 π R² of the star's surface. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the back, so no spots are visible.

Wait, no. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. So the maximum area of spots that can be seen is 0.2 of the hemisphere's area. Wait, but how much of the star's surface do we see at any given time?

Wait, when the star is seen from Earth, we can only see one hemisphere. So, when the star rotates, different parts of that visible hemisphere come into view. So the spots are on one side of the star. So when the star rotates, first you see a part with spots, then without, depending on the rotation.

Wait, perhaps the total area of the spots that can be seen from Earth is 20% of the visible hemisphere. Because the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the visible hemisphere (from Earth's viewpoint) can be the same as the hemisphere with the spots, or the opposite, depending on the rotation.

So the maximum area of the star's surface covered by spots that can be seen from Earth is 20% of the visible hemisphere, which is 20% of (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, the star's surface is 4π R². So when viewed from Earth, only 2π R² is visible (the hemisphere). The filling factor is 20% on the entire hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the area of the spots from Earth's perspective is 0.4 π R² when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, and 0 when the other hemisphere is facing us.

But wait, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum area that can be blocked is 0.4 π R². Therefore, the variation in flux would be based on that.

So the flux without any spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R²)/(4d²) ) = σ T_eff^4 (π R² / d²).

When the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted = F0 * [ (1 - f_visible) + f_visible (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

Wait, f_visible is the fraction of the visible surface covered by spots. So f_visible is 0.2 (20%). So:

F_spotted = F0 [ (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]

Which is F0 [ 0.8 + 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4 ]

We calculated (5000/6000)^4 as approximately 0.4823.

So F_spotted = F0 [ 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.4823 ] = F0 [ 0.8 + 0.09646 ] = F0 * 0.89646.

So the flux when the spots are visible is about 0.89646 F0.

When the spots are not visible (other hemisphere is facing us), the flux is F0.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F0 and F_spotted, which is F0 - 0.89646 F0 = 0.10354 F0. So the fractional change is 0.10354, or about 10.35% change.

Wait, but wait, that's the amplitude when the spots are visible. So the brightness goes down by about 10.35% when the spots are in view.

Now, compare this to a planet transiting. The change in flux when a planet transits is given by (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light. So, the fractional change is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

We are to find Rp such that (Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.10354.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.10354).

Let me compute sqrt(0.10354). Let's see:

sqrt(0.1) is about 0.3162. sqrt(0.1024) is 0.32. Let's compute 0.10354.

0.32^2 = 0.1024. 0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.32 * 0.32 = 0.1024.

0.32 * 0.32 = 0.1024. So 0.1024 is 0.32^2.

Our value is 0.10354, which is a bit higher. So sqrt(0.10354) is about 0.322.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.322.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.32, which is close. Option A is 0.39, which is around the sqrt of 0.152 (since 0.39^2 is 0.1521). So 0.32 is closer to our 0.322.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Calculated the fractional change in flux due to spots: the spots cause a dip of about 10.35%.
2. For a planet, the dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2.
3. So to get a dip of 0.1035, Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322.

So the closest option is D) ~0.32.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K. The calculation of the fractional change in flux is based on the difference between the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I computed the flux.

Wait, the star's total flux is F0 = (sigma Teff^4) * (4 pi R^2) / (4 d^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 (pi R^2 / d^2).

When the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted = (sigma Teff^4) * ( (1 - f) * 2 pi R^2 + f * 2 pi R^2 * (Ts^4 / Teff^4) ) / (4 d^2) ) ?

Wait, because when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, we have (1-f) fraction of normal surface and f fraction of spotted surface.

Wait, the area is 2 pi R^2 for the hemisphere. So the non-spotted area is (1 - f) * 2 pi R^2, and the spotted area is f * 2 pi R^2.

So the flux is:

F_spotted = [ sigma Teff^4 * (1 - f) * 2 pi R^2 + sigma Ts^4 * f * 2 pi R^2 ) ] / (4 d^2 )

Which can be factored as:

F_spotted = [ sigma (2 pi R^2) * ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f Ts^4 ) ) ] / (4 d^2 )

Divide by 4 d^2: Wait, no. Because the star's entire surface is 4 pi R^2, and when viewed from Earth, we see 2 pi R^2, so the denominator is 4 d^2, because the flux from a surface area A is (sigma T^4 A) / (4 d^2).

Wait, no. The flux from a star is L/(4 pi d^2), where L is the luminosity. So when a part of the star is cooler, the flux we receive is (L * (1 - f + f*(Ts^4/Teff^4))) ) / (4 pi d^2).

Wait, maybe another approach: the total flux from the star is F0 = L/(4 pi d^2), where L = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So F0 = (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4) / (4 pi d^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 (R^2 / d^2).

When the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f (Ts^4 / Teff^4) ].

Because the spots cover a fraction f of the surface we see. So yes, F_spotted = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (Ts^4 / Teff^4) ].

So, with f=0.2, Ts=5000 K, Teff=6000 K:

Ts^4 / Teff^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So [ (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 * 0.4823 ] = 0.8 + 0.09646 = 0.89646.

So F_spotted = 0.89646 F0.

The difference is F0 - F_spotted = F0 (1 - 0.89646 ) = F0 * 0.10354.

So the fractional change is 10.354%.

Now, to get the same fractional change from a planet, (Rp/Rstar)^2 must equal 0.10354.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39² ≈ 0.152 (higher than 0.1035)
B) ~0.07 → 0.0049
C) ~0.11 → 0.0121
D) ~0.32 → 0.1024

So option D is 0.32, which gives 0.32²=0.1024, very close to 0.1035.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor \( f = 0.2 \). The spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \). The brightness variation caused by the spots is due to the temperature difference between the spotted and unspotted regions.

The star's total flux without any spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \). When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced because the spotted regions emit less energy. The flux in the spotted state is:

\[
F_{\text{spotted}} = F_0 \left[ (1 - f) + f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \right) \right].
\]

Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823.
\]

Thus:

\[
F_{\text{spotted}} = F_0 \left[ (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 \cdot 0.4823 \right] = F_0 \left[ 0.8 + 0.09646 \right] = F_0 \cdot 0.89646.
\]

The fractional change in brightness is:

\[
\Delta F = F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}} = F_0 \cdot (1 - 0.89646) = F_0 \cdot 0.10354.
\]

This corresponds to a brightness variation of approximately \( 10.35\% \).

For a planet transiting the star, the brightness variation is given by:

\[
\Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
\]

To produce the same amplitude signal as the spots, we set:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10354.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.10354} \approx 0.322.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value is \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to option D.
