Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The setup mentions that the observation time t is greater than the time tr when the field was generated, so we're dealing with retarded potentials here.

Wait, right, retarded time. Retarded potentials are when you calculate the fields based on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time. Because the electromagnetic effects propagate at the speed of light, the fields at a later time depend on the charge's state at an earlier time.

So the scalar potential V is usually due to the charge itself, while the vector potential A comes from the motion of the charge, like its velocity. But wait, the exact expressions... I remember that the scalar potential is similar to Coulomb's law but modified for the retarded time.

Wait, for the scalar potential V, the expression would involve the charge q, permittivity epsilon_0, and some distance term. For the vector potential A, it would involve the velocity v of the charge, permeability mu_0, and the same kind of distance denominator.

But what's the denominator here? Oh, right, the denominator isn't just r, the distance, because the charge's position at the retarded time might be different. So the distance d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d would be r minus the charge's position at that earlier time tr. But wait, the exact expression is that the charge's position at tr is s(tr), so d = r - s(tr).

Wait, but in terms of the denominator in V and A, I think it's something like (d c - d Â· v), where c is the speed of light. Because the retarded time calculation involves the light travel time, and the denominator gets a Lorentz factor or something like that.

Let me think. The general expressions for the potentials when charges are moving are given by the retarded potentials formulas. The scalar potential V is (q/(4 pi epsilon_0)) times 1 over (r' - (v t)/c + ...), but wait, no, more accurately, the denominator involves the distance
