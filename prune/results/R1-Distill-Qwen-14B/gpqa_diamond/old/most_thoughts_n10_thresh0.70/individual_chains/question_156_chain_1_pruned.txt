Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry reactions and chromatography. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says a chemist does two reactions. Both involve treating oct-4-ene, but one is E and the other is Z isomer. They're both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid.

I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is used in epoxidation reactions. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. The reaction is stereospecific, right? So the stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, but what happens after that? Oh, the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh right, that's probably an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. So the epoxide opens up in an acid environment.

Let me think about the first reaction: (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure of E-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each side of the double bond, but opposite configurations. When mCPBA epoxidizes it, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the alkene because mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond.

Wait, no, mCPBA adds the oxygen as an epoxide group. The E geometry would lead to a trans epoxide? Or maybe not, because the epoxidation is stereospecific. Oh, wait, no, for a trans double bond (E), the epoxide would have the oxygens on opposite sides. So the starting E-ene becomes an epoxide with the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides.

Wait, no, maybe I should draw it. E-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 but opposite. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a trans fashion. So for E-ene, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides, making it a trans epoxide.

Then, when treated with acid, the epoxide ring opens. For acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide, the mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring then opens via a carbocation or through a similar transition state.

Wait, in acid, the ring opening is typically an SN2 mechanism for epoxides. So the nucleophile (water, in this case, since it's aqueous acid) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized, but wait, the ring opening in epoxides can lead to different products based on the structure.

Wait, in epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions, the nucleophile tends to attack the more substituted carbon because it's more stable when the positive charge is formed. Alternatively
