Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, first, what's Li with 3 neutrons? Lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Because normally, Li has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So the nucleus in question is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. So I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects are definitely important here.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the energy E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, what's the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus? I should calculate that. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are similar, around 939 MeV/c². But wait, I think I need the exact mass or the sum for Li-6.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass would be 3*(mass of proton) + 3*(mass of neutron). But wait, I also remember that the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum because of binding energy. Oh wait, but in this case, since the question is about the rest mass, I think I should calculate it as the sum of the individual nucleons. Or wait, no, the rest mass of the nucleus would be the actual mass, which is the sum minus the mass defect due to binding energy. Hmm, but for this problem, I might just proceed with the sum because the binding energy is probably negligible compared to the total mass. Or is that right?

Wait, the problem is about the energy of the nucleus
