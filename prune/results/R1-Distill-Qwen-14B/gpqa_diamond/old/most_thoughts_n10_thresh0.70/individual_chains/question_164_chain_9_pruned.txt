Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, so we have two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods. System 1 has a 2-year period, system 2 has a 1-year period. The question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor.

Wait, the problem says to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And the mass is the sum of both stars in the system.

So, I remember that in binary stars, the more massive star usually moves slower, but wait, the radial velocity (RV) amplitude is related to the mass. Oh right, the radial velocity method is used to find exoplanets. The star's velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the companion. But in this case, both stars are visible, so it's a spectroscopic binary.

I think the formula involves the mass function. For a binary system, the mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses. The mass function is given by f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but when you have both components' velocities, you can find the mass ratio.

Wait, I think the mass ratio q is M2 / M1. Also, in a binary system, the ratio of the velocities is inverse to the mass ratio. So, if star 1 has a velocity amplitude K1 and star 2 has K2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1 = q.

So, the ratio of the velocities is the inverse of the mass ratio. So for system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. So K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So K1/K2 = 2. That would mean M2/M1 = 2. So mass ratio q = M2/M1 = 2. So M1 is 1, M2 is 2, so the total mass is 3. Similarly, for system_2, the amplitudes are K1=15 and K2=10. So K1/K2 =15/10=1.5. So M2/M1 =1.5. So M1 in system_2 is say m, M2 is 1.5m. Total mass is m +1.5m=2.5m.

Wait, but wait, system_1 and system_2 have different periods. So how do I relate the masses to the periods? Because the total mass would affect the orbital period.

I recall Kepler's third law for binary systems. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1+M2)) * a³, where a is the separation. But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, the formula in terms of AU, solar masses, and years: P² = (a)^3 / (M_total), where P is in years, a in AU, M_total in solar masses. Wait, is that correct? No, the exact formula is P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M1 + M2)). So when P is in years, a in AU, M in solar masses, I think the
