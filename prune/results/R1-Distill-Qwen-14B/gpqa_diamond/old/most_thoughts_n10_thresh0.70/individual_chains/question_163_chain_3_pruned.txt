Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. Then, we have to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to prepare the solution and determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is going to be important here. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 each. So for Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85, each OH- is 17 (16 +1). So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. So moles would be mass divided by molar mass. 0.1 / 106.85. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Or wait, 0.1 / 106.85 is about 9.358e-4 moles, right?

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think, but when it's dissolved in a strong acid, it should react. The reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. I think that's the right equation. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 would require 3 moles of H+ ions to dissolve it.

So, if I have 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3, how many moles of H+ do I need? 3 times that. So 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of H+.

Now, the acid is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So the volume needed can be calculated by moles divided by concentration. So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L. That gives 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options. Option C says 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's the minimum volume needed for the acid. But wait, could there be any other factors? Like, maybe the solution's dilution or something else? Hmm, I don't think so because the problem says "minimum volume", so this calculation should suffice.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. Once the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, what's left in solution? The reaction produces Fe³+ and water. But Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water to form H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So, the pH depends on the concentration of Fe³+ ions and their hydrolysis. Let's see. The total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³, right? Because the problem says 100 cm³ total volume. So the volume is fixed at 100 cm³. The amount of Fe³+ produced is from the Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 moles, as calculated earlier.

So the concentration of Fe³+ is moles / volume in liters. 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M. Wait, 0.000936 divided by 0.1 is 0.00936 M? No, wait, 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 moles per liter, so 9.36e-3 M.

But wait, 0.000936 divided by 0.1 is 0.00936, which is 9.36 mM. Hmm, okay.

Fe³+ undergoes hydrolysis: Fe³+
