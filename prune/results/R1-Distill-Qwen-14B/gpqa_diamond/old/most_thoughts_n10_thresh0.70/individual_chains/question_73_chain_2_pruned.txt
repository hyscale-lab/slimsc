Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use special relativity, right? Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, while astronaut B has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when velocities are a significant fraction of c, you can't just do v_rel = v_A - v_B. I remember the formula for relativistic velocity addition. Let me recall the formula... Oh yeah, it's (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). But wait, both are moving in the same direction, so if we're calculating the speed of A as seen from B's frame, we need to adjust for that.

So for the relative speed, let's calculate it. Let me assign v_A as 0.6c and v_B as 0.5c. Wait, but I need to calculate how fast A is moving relative to B. Or is it the other way around? Actually, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (v_A - v_B) divided by [1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)]. Let me plug in the numbers.

v_A = 0.6c, v_B = 0.5c.

So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

Simplify numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c² / c²) → 1-0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that narrows it down.

Now for the total energy. Oh, wait, each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. But wait, what's the rest mass for each? The problem states their masses are 2m and 3m. So I think each has their own gamma factor.

Let me calculate each gamma.

For astronaut A (2m, speed 0.6c):
gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36c²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A: gamma_A * (2m) * c² → 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (3m, speed 0.5c):
gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 -
