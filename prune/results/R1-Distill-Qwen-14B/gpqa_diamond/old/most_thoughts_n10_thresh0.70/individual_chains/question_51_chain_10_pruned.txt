Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves considering the work done to bring the charges together.

Wait, the setup is a conducting sphere, which is grounded. Oh right, grounding means that the sphere is connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the Earth. But wait, in this case, the sphere is conducting, so the charge will redistribute itself on the surface. Oh, but wait, if it's grounded, any induced charges would be neutralized by the ground. Oh wait, no, no. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, when a conductor is grounded, the potential of the conductor is zero. Because the Earth is at zero potential, right?

So if the charge q is placed outside the sphere, it will induce charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges would cause the sphere to have a net charge? Or wait, no, because the sphere is a conductor and initially neutral? Hmm. Wait, no. Let me think again. If the sphere is conducting and initially neutral, when we bring a charge near it, it will cause charges to redistribute. But since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge on the sphere would be neutralized by the ground.

Wait, wait, so perhaps the sphere remains uncharged? Because any induced charges on the sphere can flow to the ground. So the sphere remains neutral
