Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that the peak wavelength of emitted light can be related to the temperature of the source, maybe something like blackbody radiation. Oh wait, that's Wien's law: lambda_max is roughly 2.9e-3 mÂ·K / T. But wait, this is observed, so I guess this is after considering redshift.

The quasar's peak is at 790 nm now, but the emitted peak would have been at a shorter wavelength. Wait, no, wait. If the observed peak is longer than emitted, that would mean the source is moving away, so redshift. Because quasars are at high redshifts, so their emitted UV light might be observed in the infrared.

So the quasar emits at a certain wavelength, but due to the expansion of the universe, we see it redshifted. So let's think: suppose the quasar's rest frame has a peak at, say, 550 nm (green, typical for optical). But we observe it at 790, which is near infrared. So the redshift z would be (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1.

Wait, let me calculate that. Observed
