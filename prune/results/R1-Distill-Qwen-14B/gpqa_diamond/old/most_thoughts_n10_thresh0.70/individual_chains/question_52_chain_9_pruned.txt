Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. And the photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels based on their temperatures.

The Boltzmann equation in its basic form is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, in this problem, the question is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So we're comparing two scenarios: one where 40% is covered (so Teff is 5500 K) and one where it's all at 6000 K.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But the spots are cooler, right? So the star's total flux would be lower when spots are present. But how does this affect the photospheric temperature? Oh, wait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the average T of the photosphere is lower.

But wait, the star isn't entirely at that temperature. The spots are cooler regions, but the rest is at 6000 K. So perhaps the model is that 60% of the surface is at 6000 K and 40% is at a lower temperature (like spots), but the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Or maybe the problem is treating the entire photosphere as having an effective temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm, perhaps for the sake of the problem, since the overall Teff is given, we can consider the average conditions.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. So the key is that when the star has spots, the photosphere is at a lower temperature. So the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? Wait, the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels: level 1 and level
