Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about electrophilic substitution reactions, specifically with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to a different substituent. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer after an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. So, for each compound, when bromine adds, the substitution occurs at the para position relative to the substituent. And I need to figure out which ones direct the incoming bromine to the para position more, less, etc.

Wait, no. Wait, electrophilic substitution—bromine acts as the electrophile. The substituents on the benzene ring will direct where the Br adds. Directing groups can be activating or deactivating, and they can be ortho/para or meta directors.

So each substituent will direct the incoming Br to certain positions. But since the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction, I need to know how much each substituent favors para substitution.

But wait, the substituents can also affect the reactivity of the ring. Activating groups make the ring more reactive, so the reaction occurs more readily. Deactivating groups make it less reactive. But the question is about the regiochemistry, the position where Br adds, not the overall rate.

So for each substituent, I need to determine if it's a strong activating or deactivating group, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing.

Let me list out the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons through the inductive effect. It's an ortho/para director. So when the benzene ring has a methyl group, the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack at the ortho and para positions relative to the methyl group. So the major product would be a mix of ortho and para, but in the case of excess Br, maybe more substitution? Or does excess Br mean multiple substitutions? Hmm, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed, so each compound only undergoes one substitution—so no multiple substitution here. So for each, the Br adds once.

Wait, but if the substituent is a strong activating group, the reaction is more likely to occur. So in the case of a methyl group, which is a strong activating group, the bromination occurs more readily, and the para isomer might be more favored.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent directs the bromine. So the substituent's directing effect determines where Br goes. So for the substituent, if it's an ortho/para director, then substitution occurs more at ortho and para positions.

But in the question, it's about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para will have a certain fraction, but for meta directors, the substituent directs Br to the meta position, so para would be zero? Or how?

Wait, no.
