Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and jot down the important points.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The stars appear to have the same wavelength at which they are brightest. Oh wait, wait. Oh right, the peak wavelength emission for a black body depends on its temperature. Because, you know, from Wien's Law, which says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is the same, so T must be same for both stars. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but wait, the stars' masses are the same ratio as their radii. Hmm, but for main sequence stars, mass and radius are related, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. But since the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, maybe I don't need to worry too much about their mass beyond possibly their temperatures. But since their temperatures are same, as per the same peak wavelength, maybe the mass and radius info is a bit of a red herring, or perhaps it's to make sure we don't assume anything about their temperatures based on mass or radius alone.

So the question is about their luminosities. The problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is computed to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. We have to find that factor.

The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. Hmm, these are all around 2.2 or 2.3, so the factor is a little less than 2.35.

Wait, so luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same T, because same peak wavelength, their luminosities will be proportional to R² each.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So let me compute the ratio of L1 to L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T⁴

So L1/L2 = (R1²) / (R2²) because T and all other constants cancel out.

Given R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2².

So L1/L2 should be 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So why are the other options higher?

Wait, wait a second. Did I miss anything else? The problem mentions radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, the radial velocity is used to calculate Doppler shift or something? Oh, but in the problem statement, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are same, but the rest wavelengths would be different if they have different velocities.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So maybe the observed wavelength is same. But the actual (rest) wavelength depends on their velocities.

Wait
