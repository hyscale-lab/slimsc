Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. So the researchers want to observe the planet that's more likely to transit because they have limited time. Both planets are Earth-like, detected via the RV method. So they know their masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the question says both have the same mass. Oh, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3. Since orbital period is related to the size of the orbit, maybe Planet_1 is closer to its star.

But wait, the host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because usually, more massive stars are bigger, but here they have the same radius. So maybe Planet_1's host is more massive but hasn't expanded yet, while Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, perhaps a subgiant or something, but same radius.

The question is about transit probability. Oh, right, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But more technically, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the probability that a planet transits is given by the formula (R_star / a) where R_star is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But I might be mixing things up. Let's think again. Oh right, for a circular orbit, the probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, but since planets are much smaller than stars, R_p is negligible, so it's approximately (R_* / a). But actually, I think the exact formula is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star from our point of view. So the chance is proportional to (R_*/a), but maybe squared? Or perhaps it's more about the relative size of the orbit compared to the star.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for
