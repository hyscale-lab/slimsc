Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, the method of images or considering induced charges might come into play. Oh wait, but the sphere is grounded, so that could affect things.

So the system consists of a charge q and a conducting sphere. The conducting sphere is grounded, which probably means any induced charges on it can be adjusted because the sphere is connected to the earth. But how does that affect the potential?

Wait, the potential energy of a system with charges is usually the work done to bring them from infinity to their positions. But since the conducting sphere is grounded, its potential is zero because it's connected to the earth. Oh, right, conductors in electrostatic equilibrium have the same potential throughout, so the sphere's potential is zero.

So the charge q is placed outside the sphere. The sphere being conducting implies that any external charge will induce an opposite charge on the outer surface, but wait, since it's grounded, the induced charge might be such that the sphere's potential remains zero. Let me think: when a charge is outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded.

Wait, but the presence of the charge q would cause the sphere to have an induced charge, but since it's conducting, the induced charges are on the surface. So the sphere's potential is zero, so the induced charge must be such that the potential due to q and the induced charges at the sphere's surface sums to zero.

Alternatively, maybe I should model this using the method of images. Oh, right! For a conducting sphere, the image charge method can be used. The image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere is given by q' = - q (R/d'), where d' is the distance from the charge to the center. Wait, no, I think the image charge setup is when the sphere is uncharged. But in this case, the sphere is grounded, so perhaps it's a bit different.

Wait, but wait. The sphere is grounded, so any induced charge on it would adjust to maintain its potential at zero. So the sphere's potential is zero, and the charge q is at some point outside. So
