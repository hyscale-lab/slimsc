Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the angles between the lattice planes.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... I think that's a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and the angles between them are the same. Oh right, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees here. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are the same because it's a rhombohedral system. So a = b = c = 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_hkl is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice constants. The general formula I think is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (something with the cosines of the angles). Oh wait, no, I think for cubic systems it's simpler, but for rhombohedral, it's a bit more complex.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos α) / a² )? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall the general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system.

I think the general formula for d_hkl is given by 1/(d^2) = (h^2/(a^2)) + (k^2/(b^2)) + (l^2/(c^2)) ) - ( (h k (cos γ) )/(a b) ) - ( (h l (cos β) )/(a c) ) - ( (k l (cos α) )/(b c) ) ) 

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma =
