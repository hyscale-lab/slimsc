Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about metrics and pseudospheres.

The metric provided is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions, so it's probably a 2D surface embedded in some space, maybe anti-de Sitter or something else. I remember that pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid.

The question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Oh wait, the radius of a pseudosphere is related to its curvature. For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative and constant. The formula for the area might involve the Gaussian curvature somehow.

I think the area of a surface in differential geometry is computed using the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric here is diagonal, so the determinant would be the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Let me write that down.

The metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of g would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

But wait, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So dA = 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx
