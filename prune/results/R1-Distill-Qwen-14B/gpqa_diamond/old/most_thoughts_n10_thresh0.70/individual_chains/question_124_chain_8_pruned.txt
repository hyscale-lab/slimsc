Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particles in a detector. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

The problem says we have particles produced at the center of a spherical detector. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Wait, the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So, originally, with a Lorentz factor of 20, only a third make it. We need to find a higher gamma where two-thirds make it. Because higher gamma would mean faster particles, so more would reach the walls before decaying, right?

I remember that the proper lifetime of a particle (tau) is related to the observed lifetime (t) by the Lorentz factor. The lifetime is longer in the lab frame when the particle is moving fast, so they can travel further before decaying.

The idea is that the particles will travel a certain distance before decaying. The fraction that reach the detector walls depends on the time they take to decay compared to the time it takes for them to reach the walls.

Wait, but the particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel before hitting the detector is 30 meters (the radius). So the time it takes for them to reach the detector walls (t_max) is the radius divided by their velocity.

But since they're ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately c, right? So t_max = 30 m / c. Let's compute that. Speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So t_max â‰ˆ 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds? Hmm, that seems right.

Now, the particles' lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime (tau). So t = gamma * tau. The particles will decay at a time t, and if t < t_max, they won't reach the detector. So the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is the ratio t_decay / t_max.

Wait, but the probability that they decay before reaching the wall is the same as the fraction that don't reach the wall. So if a third reach the
