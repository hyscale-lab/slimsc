Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem. Wait, the optical theorem connects the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. But wait, I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Oh right, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the initial direction (like the forward direction) is given by something involving the phase shifts.

Wait, the formula I think is Im(f(θ=0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum of the phase shifts, where k is the wave number, but wait, maybe it's the sum of (δ_l + something) for each partial wave. Or wait, another approach: I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(θ=0) is given by (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum of the phase shifts δ_l (l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number) for each partial wave. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the exact formula right.

I recall the general expression: The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be written as a sum over all angular momentum states, involving the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. But when you evaluate this along the incident direction (θ=0), it simplifies. Oh right, the formula for the imaginary part at θ=0 is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) δ_l. Wait, no, maybe it's simpler. Because the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is 4π/k² times the imaginary part of f(0), or something like that. Let me think.

Wait, I think the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum_l (2l+1) δ_l. Or perhaps it's more like the sum of δ_l, each multiplied by (2l +1). Because each partial wave contributes (2l+1)δ_l. So the sum would be summing (2l +1) times each δ_l, then multiply by 1/(2k).

But wait, in the problem statement, the phase shifts given are δ0, δ1, etc.
