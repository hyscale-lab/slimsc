Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R.

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² radially, and it's only got a radial component in spherical coordinates. So, first, I need to remember what divergence means in spherical coordinates. Oh wait, right, the divergence of a vector field depends on the coordinate system you're using. Since this problem is in spherical coordinates, I should probably use the spherical form of the divergence formula.

The general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) * d(r² A_r) / dr + (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂(A_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) * (1/∂φ) ∂A_φ/∂φ. But wait, in this case, the vector field only has a radial component, right? So the other components (theta and phi) are zero. That should simplify things a lot.

So the divergence should reduce to just the radial part. Let's see, so A_θ and A_φ are zero, so the divergence ∇·f will be (1/(r²)) * d(r² A_r)/dr. Because the other terms vanish since their partial derivatives are zero.

Given that the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only radial, that means A_r = f(r) = 1/r². So the divergence is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me calculate that. 

r² * (1/r²) is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Wait, that's interesting. So the divergence of this field is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? Because r=0 is a point we need to be careful about.

Wait, but the integral is over a volume inside the sphere of radius R. So the integral of the divergence over this volume would be zero? Because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0
