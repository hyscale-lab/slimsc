Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0 at a specific time t. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And the observable P is a matrix with specific elements.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of these operators. So to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then calculate the projection of the given state onto that eigenvector.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. But wait, the question is specifically asking for the probability of getting 0, so I should look for eigenvectors where the eigenvalue is 0.

The matrix P is:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, this looks symmetric, so it's definitely Hermitian. Good, that makes sense for an observable.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So, the matrix (P - λI) is:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero.

Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious. Let me set up the determinant equation.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row is easier.

So:

det = -λ * det[ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ) ] 
- (1/√2) * det[ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ) ] 
+ 0 * ...

The first term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

The second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 
= - (1/√2) * [ -λ / √2 ]
= - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2) 
= (1/√2)(λ/√2) 
= λ/(2)

The third term is zero.

So putting it all together:
det = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0

Expand that:
-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0
Wait, because:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ * 1/2)

So, -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ = 0

So, equation becomes: -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ(-λ² +1) = 0 → λ (1 - λ²) =0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Good, so 0 is an eigenvalue. Now, I need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to λ=0.

So, (P - 0I) v = 0 → P v =0.

Let me write the equations for this.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0x + (1/√2) y + 0 z = 0
Row 2: (1/√2)x + 0 y + (1/√2) z = 0
Row 3: 0x + (1/√2) y + 0 z = 0

Wait, but row 1 and row 3 are the same? Because row 1 is 0, 1/√2, 0 and row 3 is 0, 1/√2, 0. So that's the same as row 1. Hmm, so two equations are the same.

So, the equations are:

(1) (1/√2) y = 0 → y=0
(2) (1/√2) x + (1/√2) z =0 → x + z = 0 → z = -x
(3) same as equation 1, so y=0.

So, the eigenvectors satisfy y=0, and z= -x.

So, let x be a parameter, say x = a, then z = -a. y=0.

So, the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a) → a(1, 0, -1).

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1,0,-1). But it's a column vector, right? So the eigenvector can be written as [1; 0; -1].

Wait, but it's an eigenvector, so any scalar multiple is fine. We can normalize it, but perhaps not necessary for finding the probability.

Now, the state vector of the system is given as (-1, 2, 1) as a column matrix. Let me write this as a vector v = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized, but the question doesn't specify that. Hmm, but the probability could depend on the inner product regardless.

Wait, but the observable's eigenvectors form a basis, so perhaps the system's state can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors.

But regardless, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of 0.

Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1), the projection is (v · u) / (u · u) * u, where u is the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but let's calculate the inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector.

The eigenvector is (1,0,-1), but wait, I should normalize it. Because the probability is given by |<u|ψ>|², where u is the normalized eigenvector.

So first, compute the norm of the eigenvector (1,0,-1):

||u||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)^2 = 1 + 0 +1 = 2 → ||u||=√2.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Now, the state vector is v = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but wait—am I confusing bra and ket vectors here? In quantum mechanics, the state is a ket vector, and the inner product is the conjugate transpose (bra) multiplied by the ket.

So, the inner product would be <u|v> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) )= (-2/√2) = -√2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because inner product squared would depend on this.

Wait, but wait—the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). I'm assuming this is a column vector in the standard basis, and the observable's eigenvectors are in the same basis.

So, the inner product <u |v> is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = [ (-1)(1/√2) ) ] + [ (-1)(1/√2) ) ] = (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

So, the inner product is -√2. The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (| -√2 | )² = (√2)^2 =2.

Wait, but wait! The state vector given is not normalized. So, when calculating probabilities, I should normalize the state first, right?

Because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities must sum to 1, which requires the state vector to be normalized.

So, let me compute the norm of the given state vector v: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6).

So, the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6))* [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So, the inner product <u|v_normalized> is [1/√2 * (-1)/√6 ] + [0 * 2/√6 ] + [ (-1/√2) * (1)/√6 ]

= [ (-1)/(√2 √6) )
