Okay, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

So the solution has 200.00 cm³, which I should convert to liters because molarity is per liter. 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters. Got it.

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that these are phosphate salts, and they dissociate in water. I think KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, but wait, the one here has two waters of hydration. But I guess the formula will still break down into ions.

The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. So I need to calculate moles for each.

Starting with KH2PO4: moles = mass / Mw. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.00734 moles. Wait, 136.09 times 0.00734 would give me around 1. Hmm, yeah, that seems right.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. So 1 divided by 177.99 is roughly 0.005606 moles. Let me check: 177.99 * 0.005606 is about 1. So that's correct.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. But I think the important part is the HPO4^2- concentration because that's what contributes to the phosphate ions in solution.

Now, when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, I think they form a buffer solution. Because KH2PO4 dissociates into H2O: K+ + H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O. So we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution.

Wait, so what's the relation between these ions? H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait no, wait. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or is it H2PO4^-? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, actually, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it loses one proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). So orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's usually in one of the deprotonated forms. Wait, but in this solution, the phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Ortho usually refers to HPO4^2-? Or perhaps H2PO4^-? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here. Alternatively, maybe orthophosphate refers to the conjugate base, which would be HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? No, I think orthophosphate is HPO4^3- but wait, no, that's phosphate. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps orthophosphate is the form H2PO4^-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. But in solution, it's usually deprotonated. So perhaps the question is actually referring to the HPO4^2- concentration? Or the sum of all phosphate species?

Wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions." Orthophosphate, I think, refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Because in phosphate salts, the different anions are named based on their charge. For example, H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate, HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is phosphate.

Wait, but I might be mixing this up. Let me confirm. Okay, I'll try to remember: H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate). Another loss gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and another gives PO4^3- (phosphate). So orthophosphate would be the HPO4^2- form, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the term refers to the species in solution, which could include more than one.

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions. Let me think about the actual ions present. We have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and K+; Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2- and Na+.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The total phosphate comes from both. But the question is about orthophosphate ions. So perhaps orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

But wait, another approach. Let's think about the buffer solution. When you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson
