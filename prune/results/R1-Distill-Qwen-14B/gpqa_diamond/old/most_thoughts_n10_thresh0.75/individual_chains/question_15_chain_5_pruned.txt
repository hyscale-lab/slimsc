Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. So researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they need to pick the one with the higher probability of transiting. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the question says both have the same mass. Oh, right, but same mass doesn't directly mean same planet size, but maybe for Earth-like, that's a close enough assumption.

So, Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star since the orbital period is shorter. Because orbital period relates to the distance from the star via Kepler's third law, right? So if Planet_1's period is shorter, it's orbiting closer.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. Because one is more massive but same radius, which might mean it's a subgiant or something, but in this case, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but same radius. So maybe both stars are a bit larger than main sequence for Planet_2, but same size as each other.

Wait, but how does the star's mass and radius affect transit probability? Oh, right, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But since both planets are Earth-like, their sizes are similar, but the stars' sizes are the same, so the planet-to-star size ratio would be the same? Wait no, because the host stars have same radius but different masses. Wait, the star's radius is same, so planet size same, so the ratio (R_planet / R_star) would be same for both. Wait, but same mass planets, same star size, so same ratio. Hmm, but that can't be the case because the question is about probabilities.

Wait, but also, the orbital distance affects the probability. The probability of a planet transiting is higher if its orbit is more edge-on relative to us. But since both planets are detected via RV, their orbits are known to be around their stars, but the inclination isn't known unless we have the transit.

Wait, the transit
