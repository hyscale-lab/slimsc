Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The question says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

First, let me figure out the initial steps. When you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Since we're mixing two volumes, I can use the dilution formula.

The initial concentration is 0.05 M, volume 20 cm³. Then adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Using M1V1 = M2V2, the new concentration M2 is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that: 0.05 *20=1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for the titration, I think we'll have to consider its behavior as a weak acid reacting with a strong base.

So the next part is the titration with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react with the acetic acid in a neutralization reaction.

The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.

So first, let's find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

The diluted acetic acid volume is 40 cm³ (20+20), concentration 0.025 M. So moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume (in liters). 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol too.

But wait, let's think about the volume of NaOH needed. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration. 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, 25% titration of the acetic acid means that 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. So that would be 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

So when 25% of the acetic acid is titrated, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate.

So for the 25% titration point, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). So in this case, the base is acetate (A-) and the acid is acetic acid (HA).

At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added
