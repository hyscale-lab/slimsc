Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle has something to do with the precision with which we can know an electron's position and momentum. The question is asking about the minimum uncertainty in energy, given the uncertainty in position.

Wait, the problem states that the electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its location Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. So Δx is the uncertainty in position, right? Because heisenberg's principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. So the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So first, I should find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Then, since momentum p is mass times velocity, and the uncertainty in momentum relates to the uncertainty in energy, I think. Wait, but how?

Oh, right. The energy of a particle is given by E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy ΔE can be found from the uncertainty in momentum. But wait, how exactly? Oh, maybe I need to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, but wait, here the problem is giving me spatial uncertainty. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The question gives the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the speed. Wait, the speed is given, but the uncertainty is about the location. So perhaps the momentum is known with some
