Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for three spins. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Alright, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-Î²E), right? Because each state contributes to the partition function based on its energy. So I need to figure out all possible states of the three spins and compute their energies.

Each spin has two possible states: +1 or -1. So for three spins, S1, S2, S3, each can be either +1 or -1. That means there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the symmetry. The energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3. So the system's energy depends on how many of these pairs are aligned or anti-aligned.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this in terms of the number of neighboring pairs. Wait, but in this case, the system is a triangle, each spin connected to the other two. So each pair contributes to the energy.

Wait, but each term S_i S_j is +1 if they are aligned (same spin) and -1 if anti-aligned. So each term contributes +1 or -1.

The energy E is equal to
