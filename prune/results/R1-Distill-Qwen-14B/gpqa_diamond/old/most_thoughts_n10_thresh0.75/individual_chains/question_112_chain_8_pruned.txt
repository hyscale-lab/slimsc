Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The problem is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator, so I think I'll need to use some concepts from quantum mechanics, like state vectors, operators, and maybe eigenvalues.

The state given is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, since it's proportional, I guess I should normalize it first. Because probabilities need to sum to 1, right? So first, I'll find the normalization factor.

The vectors |up> and |down> are orthonormal eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, which probably means they form an orthonormal basis. So the state |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of these. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), but I need to normalize the state.

The normalization factor is found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient. So the magnitude squared of (1+i) is |1+i|^2 = 1^2 +1^2 = 2. Similarly, for (2-i), it's |2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So adding those gives 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so let's think about the matrix form. For a 2x2 matrix, since it's spin-½, the operator A would look like this:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Because when i≠j, the element is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are zero.

Wait, but in the problem, it's said that A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else zero. So yeah, that's the matrix form.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the operator's matrix elements are usually in the basis of the states. So our current basis is |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z, the z-component of spin. So the operator A is represented in that basis.

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. Hmm, so the eigenstates of A are the states in which a measurement of A would give a definite result.

So I think the approach is to find the eigenstates of A, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and the square of the coefficients would be the probabilities.

But wait, another approach is to find the possible eigenvalues of A and the corresponding eigenstates, then compute the probability of each eigenvalue when measuring A on state |alpha>.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator A.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]
