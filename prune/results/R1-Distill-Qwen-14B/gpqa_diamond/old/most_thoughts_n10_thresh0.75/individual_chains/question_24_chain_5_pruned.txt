Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question talks about two mixtures, X and Y, and a substance Z. Let me try to parse this.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. Importantly, mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. 

Then, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Also, Z is a component of Y and is used as a solvent. And importantly, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. 

Another point is that mixture X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds in its compounds. 

So, I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm. Let's think about what each part implies.

Starting with the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So Z must be a product that both X and Y can hydrogenate into. Also, since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, each contributes equally, but hydrogenation leads to the same product Z.

Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z first. 

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so if I take 100g of Z, 14.28g is H, and 85.72g is C. 

Molar masses: Carbon is 12 g/mol, Hydrogen is 1 g/mol.

So, moles of H: 14.28 / 1 =14.28 mol.

Moles of C: 85.72 /12 ≈7.143 mol.

So the ratio C:H is 7.143 : 14.28 ≈1:2. So the formula is C7H14? Wait, wait. Wait, 7.143 is approximately 7 * (1/12), but maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 85.72 divided by 12 is 7.143333... So 7.143333 moles of C to 14.28 moles of H.

So, 7.143 /14.28 = 0.5, so the ratio is 1:2. So the formula is CnH2n.

Wait, but n would be 7.143. Hmm, but that's not an integer. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the calculation.

Another way: Let the formula be CxHy. The mass percent of H is (y * 1) / (12x + y) ) *100 =14.28.

So,

(y) / (12x + y) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

y = 0.1428*(12x + y)

=> y = 1.7136 x + 0.1428 y

=> y - 0.1428 y = 1.7136 x

=> 0.8572 y = 1.7136 x

Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals: 8572 y = 17136 x. Hmm, let me see if I can simplify this ratio.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 2143 y = 4284 x. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps divide 1.7136 by 0.8572.

Wait, 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2. So x is approximately 1, and y is approximately 2. But that gives CH2, which is impossible. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me try calculating the molecular formula again.

Let me consider the molecular formula of Z. Let's suppose Z is C7H14.

Molar mass of C7H14 is (7×12)+(14×1) =84 +14=98 g/mol.

Hydrogen's mass in Z: 14 ×1 /98 =0.142857, which is 14.2857%, very close to the given 14.28%. So that fits. So Z is heptene? Or is it something else?

Wait, no, heptene would be an alkene. But Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so perhaps it's a fully saturated compound. Because if it were an alkene, it would react with hydrogen (since hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds).

So if Z is an alkane. Then C7H14 would be a possible formula. But wait, for an alkane, the general formula is CnH2n+2. So 2n+2 =14 => 2n=12 =>n=6. So C6H14 is hexane. Wait, hexane's molecular formula is C6H14, right. Its molar mass is (6×12)+(14×1)=72+14=8
