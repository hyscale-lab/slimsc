Okay, so I've got this question here about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal, right? I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal too. Oh wait, right, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same, which in this case they're 30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh right, that's the d-spacing. So how do I calculate d-spacing for a given plane?

I recall the formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is given by something involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters and the angles. Oh wait, the general formula for d-spacing in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, that's only for cubic systems where all angles are 90 degrees. But here we're dealing with a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it more like a cube that's been skewed?

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so all edges are equal (a = b = c), but the angles are not 90 degrees. So the formula must account for the angles between the lattice vectors. I think the general formula when the lattice isn't cubic is a bit more complex.

Yes, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal lattice is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / a² - 2(hk cosβγ + hk cosαγ + ... ) / (a²) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember that the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(k l cos α)/(b c) ) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, let's call them a. And all the angles are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees
