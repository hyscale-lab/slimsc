Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this.

First, I should recall what an enol is. An enol is an alcohol with a double bond adjacent to the hydroxyl group, right? So the structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol would have a cyclopentene ring with a hydroxyl group on carbon 1 and methyl groups on carbon 4. Wait, wait, let me draw this mentally. Cyclopentene is a five-membered ring with a double bond. So in this case, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, right? Because it's cyclopent-1-enol. So the hydroxyl group is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between 1 and 2. But wait, no, wait. Enol structure is usually an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So the enol form has the hydroxyl on a carbon next to a double bond. So for cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl is on C2? Or maybe C1. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Enol is an alcohol with a double bond adjacent. So structure is R2C=CH-OH. Wait, no, that's
