Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the product is, given the IR and NMR data, and the options provided.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data. Let's start with the IR. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an X-H stretch or an amide. But since the other peaks are 1720, 1610, and 1450, maybe it's an ester or a carboxylic acid? Wait, 1720 is a strong peak, which is typical for an ester (C=O stretch) or maybe a ketone. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be a broad peak around 2500-3300. The IR here shows a broad region from 3400–2500, which might suggest an O-H group. But in carboxylic acids, the O-H is usually broader. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol or another acidic proton like an amine, but I don't see any amine peaks usually.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are reagents. Oh, I remember! Red phosphorus with HI is typically used for the hydrolysis of esters, especially in a reaction called the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's the case of HI being used to cleave something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe Compound X is an ester, and when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes some kind of cleavage. Or perhaps it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus with HI is sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's used in the cleavage of alkenes. Wait, I think that's another reaction. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, an alkene might undergo hydrohalogenation, but that's usually with
