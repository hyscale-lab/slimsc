Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to parse through it step by step. Okay, the question is about an electron and a positron annihilating each other and producing two photons. The setup is that the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, okay, I think I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. And because of conservation laws, like momentum and energy, the photons must go in certain directions. But wait, the positron has a positive charge, so it's like the opposite of the electron. So when they collide, their combined momentum and energy must be considered.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. But wait, gamma is calculated as 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But since we're given the Lorentz factors, maybe I can use them to find the relativistic momenta and energies.

Let me think about the momenta. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)², so for each particle, their energies would be E = gamma m c².

So the electron's energy is E_e = gamma_e * m_e c², and the positron's energy is E_p = gamma_p * m_e c², since they have the same mass. Oh, but wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So I need to consider their momenta as vectors.

So let's model this. Let's say the horizontal axis is the x-axis. The electron is moving to the right (from left), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from right), so its momentum is negative. Wait, but wait, if the positron is moving from the right, its velocity is in the negative x direction. So its momentum would be negative.

Wait, so the electron is moving along +
