Okay, I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, a supernova happened in our galaxy. Part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so both frames are inertial. That probably means I can use special relativity here because the frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The problem states that the ejecta's frame (let's call it S') sees the Galaxy's center moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. But wait, direction matters here. If in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, then in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy.

But the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I think this involves time dilation and maybe length contraction.

Wait, no, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be the proper distance, right? Because the Galaxy's frame is the rest frame where the distance is not contracted. The ejecta's frame is moving, so in their frame, the distance might appear contracted, but we're measuring their movement in the Galaxy's frame, so perhaps I need to calculate how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame for those 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, maybe I should think about it using the Lorentz transformation. Let's outline what I know.

Let v be the relative velocity between the two frames. In this case, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to m/s for easier calculations. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s, which is 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, wait: 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s, which is
