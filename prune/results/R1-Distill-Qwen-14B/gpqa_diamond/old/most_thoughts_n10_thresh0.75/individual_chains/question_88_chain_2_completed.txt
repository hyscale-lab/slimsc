Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? The question says they tagged the inner capsid proteins with GFP and gave them to mice orally. 

Wait, when they did the in vivo imaging, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh, right, the stomach has a lot of acid, which can break down proteins. So those GFP-tagged proteins probably didn't survive the stomach environment. But some made it past the acid and got entangled in the intestinal mucus. Oh, I think mucus in the intestines can trap things, maybe preventing them from being absorbed or causing some issues. 

So then, they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. Peyer patches are part of those, right? They're these structures in the intestinal wall that contain immune cells. So the fluorescent proteins ended up there. They isolated the proliferating cell population from the Peyer patches. These cells are probably B cells because in lymphoid organs, B cells are the ones that make antibodies, and proliferation suggests they're activated.

Then, they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. High variability in the variable region of antibodies is a big clue. I remember that during the immune response, especially in B cells, the variable regions undergo changes to create diversity. Oh wait, that's called somatic hypermutation. 

So what's happening here is that the B cells in the Peyer patches are undergoing some process that changes their variable regions. Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs in B cells after they're activated. It's a way to increase the diversity of the antibodies they produce, allowing for a better immune response. This happens in germinal centers, which are part of the lymphoid tissues like Peyer patches.

Looking at the options:

A) somatic hypermutation — this seems right because it explains the variability in the heavy chain genes.

B) complement activation — that's more about the classical pathway leading to opsonization or lysis, not about gene variability.

C) class switching recombination — this changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it's a different process and doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions.

D) VDJ recombination — that's the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined. But that's during initial antibody formation, not during the immune response after antigen exposure. So this wouldn't explain the high variability in already isolated cells.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation. The B cells are proliferating and undergoing this process to generate a diverse set of antibodies, which the sequencing data shows as high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.


The experiment involves tagging inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the intestinal mucus and eventually the secondary lymphoid organs, including Peyer patches. In these patches, the proliferating cell population is isolated, and sequencing of their variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability.

This variability in the variable heavy chain genes is a hallmark of **somatic hypermutation**, a process that occurs in activated B cells within lymphoid tissues like Peyer patches. Somatic hypermutation increases the diversity of antibodies by introducing random mutations in the variable regions of immunoglobulins, enhancing the immune response. The other options—complement activation, class switching recombination, and VDJ recombination—do not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes. Complement activation involves opsonization or lysis, class switching recombination changes the antibody isotype, and VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, not during immune responses to antigens.

Thus, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
