Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me think. The system has three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? So each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1. That gives 2^3 = 8 possible states.

But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the energy expression. E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. But wait, since E is multiplied by -J, the energy depends on the sum of these terms.

Let me first figure out how many possible energy levels there are, and how many states correspond to each level. Then, I can compute Z by summing over each energy level multiplied by the number of states at that energy.

Hmm, the sum inside E is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me denote this sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J H.

Each S_i can be ±1, so each product S_i S_j is also ±1. So the sum H can range from -3 to +3, but maybe only certain values are possible.

Wait, let me compute for each possible combination what H is. But that's 8 terms, maybe manageable.

Alternatively, I can think of each pair: there are three pairs. Each can contribute +1 or -1. So possible H values are the sum of three terms each ±1. So possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3, but let me check.

Wait, no. Let's see: each pair is either 1 or -1. So for three pairs, the sum can be 3 (all 1s), 1 (two 1s and one -1), -1 (two -1s and one 1), or -3 (all -1s). So possible H: 3, 1, -1, -3.

But wait, wait,
