Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I think I should normalize this state because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficients for |up> and |down> are (1+i) and (2 - i), respectively. The state is proportional, meaning we might need to divide by a normalization constant. Let me calculate the normalization factor.

The normalization factor N is the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. So for |up> it's |1+i| squared. The absolute value of 1+i is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared it's 2. For |down>, the coefficient is 2 - i, so |2 - i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5), and squared is 5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So N is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator with matrix elements A_ij. The operator A has elements where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds like a matrix representation. Since it's a 2x2 matrix for spin-up and spin-down states, the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], 
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Hmm, because for i≠j, it's hbar/2, else zero. So that's an off-diagonal matrix. What kind of operator is this? It looks like a spin operator, but not the usual Sz operator (which is diagonal). Wait, Sz has diagonal elements ±hbar/2. This operator A would correspond to the spin-x operator, maybe? Because the spin-x operator's matrix is (hbar/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], which is exactly this matrix if we set all the elements to hbar/2. So operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, but the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, right? So the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x> states, and the coefficients would give the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate.

So the plan is: express |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |-x> and find the probabilities, then compute the expectation value of A.

Alternatively, since A is the operator, the expectation value is the expectation of A with |alpha> as the state.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to find the expectation value first, using the given state, and then find the probabilities of the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps we can diagonalize operator A and express |alpha> in terms of its eigenstates. Then, the probabilities are the square of the coefficients, and the expectation is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Let me think about diagonalizing A. The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues for such a matrix can be found by solving det(A - λI) =0.

So the equation is:

| (-λ)       (hbar/2)     |
| (hbar/2)    (-λ)       |  = 0

Which gives λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2 → λ= ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the operator A has eigenvalues hbar/2 (let me write it as (ħ/2) for simplicity) and -ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for these eigenvalues. For λ= ħ/2, the equation (A - (ħ/2) I)|v> =0:
The matrix becomes [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]]. So the equations are:

-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1,1]^T. Similarly, for λ=-ħ/2, we have [1, -1]^T.

But wait, these vectors are not normalized. Let's normalize them. The norm for [1,1] is sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvectors are (1/sqrt(2))|up> + (1/sqrt(2))|down> for +ħ/2, and (1/sqrt(2))|up> - (1/sqrt(2))|down> for -ħ/2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, we can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

We can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

We need to compute c_+ and c_-.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, that would be:

c_+ = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] × (1/sqrt(2))?

Wait, no. Let me think. |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to find c_+, we can take the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>.

c_+ = < +x | alpha >

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha >.

Let me compute c_+:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Since <up|down> = 0, this becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

Wait, but more simply, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ] because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and cross terms are zero.

Wait, no, because <down|up> is zero. So when you expand, it's only the terms where the same states are paired.

So, < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ].

That simplifies to (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ].

Calculating numerator: (1+i + 2 -i ) = 3.

So c_+ = (3) / (sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- is the inner product with |-x>:

c_- = < -x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Again, when expanding, only the same states contribute:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) <down|down> ]

So that's (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i )= (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

And |c_-|^2: [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] → magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, this adds up to 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, so that's correct.

Hmm, looking at the answer options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. Oh wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is ~0.357, which is ~0.36. So the first two numbers in option A match. So the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is 9/14, which is approximately 0.64, and the other is 5/14, ~0.36.

Wait but let me double-check: 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., so 0.64 is exact? Or not. Well, the options might have rounded.

Now, the average value of the operator A is the expectation value <A>. Which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since we've expressed |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, the expectation value is |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2).

So, let's compute that.

|c_+|^2 is 9/14, |c_-|^2 is 5/14.

So expectation value = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] (ħ/2 ) = (4/14)(ħ/2) = (2/7) ħ/2 → (2/7) (ħ/2) = ħ/(7).

Wait, that would be option A, which says average is hbar/7.

Wait, so the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and average is ħ/7. So option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. That's option A.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes. So that's the correct one?

Wait, but wait another approach. Let me compute the expectation value using the original state.

The operator A is represented as [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed as a column vector, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The expectation value <A> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So, let me compute this.

Let me denote |alpha> as a column vector [a; b], where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then, <A> = [a* , b*] * A * [a; b].

Compute each part:

A * [a; b] = [ (0*a + (ħ/2)*b ), ( (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ) ] = [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ].

Then, [a* , b* ] multiplied by that is a* (ħ/2) b + b* (ħ/2) a.

So, <A> = (ħ/2) [ a* b + b* a ].

Note that a* b + b* a is 2 Re(a* b).

Compute a* and b*.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7), so b* is (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

Compute a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) / (7).

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2 = 2 -3i -1 (since i^2=-1) → 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i) /7.

Multiply numerator: 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i → 2 + 2i +i + i^2 → 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i.

So b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Now, a* b + b* a = [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] /7 → (2)/7.

So Re(a* b)= (a* b + b* a)/2 = (2/7)/2 = 1/7.

Wait, but in <A>, I have (ħ/2) * [ a* b + b* a ] = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/(7).

Which matches what I found earlier. So the expectation value is ħ/7, which is option A's third value.

Therefore, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are \( (1+i) \) and \( (2-i) \), respectively. The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{so the total is } 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Diagonalize the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \hbar/2 \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle \), \( |-x\rangle \) basis
To find the probabilities of measuring \( \pm \hbar/2 \), express \( |\alpha\rangle \) as a linear combination of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
c_+ = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
P(+\hbar/2) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\hbar/2) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the eigenstate decomposition, this becomes:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( \pm \hbar/2 \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). These results match **Option A**.
