Okay, so I've got this problem about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are A to D, so I have to figure out which one is correct.

Let me start by recalling what equilibrium temperature depends on. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). But wait, both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So I don't need to worry about albedo in the ratio.

The star's properties are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff 6300 K. The planets have masses 7 and 5 Earth masses, but wait, mass probably doesn't matter for equilibrium temperature because that's about the star's radiation. The planet's radius matters for the transit method, but for equilibrium temperature, it's the distance from the star (semi-major axis, 'a') that matters.

Wait, but the problem gives me the RV shifts. Oh, right! The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The shift gives us the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period. But wait, the problem says that both planets cause shifts in the same forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So, the Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the velocity (v) by the formula Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light. Here, the line is at 6300 Å, so for each planet, I can find v.

For Planet1: Δλ = 0.03 Å. So, v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 /6300)*c.

But wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ). But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (2π G / (P))^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)).

But without knowing the orbital periods, how can I find the semi-major axes? Because equilibrium temperature depends on 'a'. Hmm, maybe I can find the ratio of the velocities and relate that to the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Wait, both planets are orbiting the same star, so the star's mass is the same. Let me denote M_star as M. So K1 = (v1) = (2π G / (P1))^(1/3) * (M1 sin i) / (M^(2/3)) )

Similarly, K2 = v2 = (2π G / (P2))^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / (M^(2/3)) )

But I don't know the periods P1 and P2. But maybe I can relate the velocities and the periods through Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M + m)/(4π²). Since M >> m, it's approximately (a^3)/(P^2) = G M/(4π²).

So P^2 = (4π² a^3)/(G M).

Let me try to substitute P into the expression for K.

From K = [ (2π G)/(P) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet)/(M^(2/3)) )

Substituting P from Kepler's law:

P = sqrt( (4π² a^3)/(G M) )

So, (1/P) = sqrt( G M )/(2 π a^(3/2) )

So, [ (2π G)/(P) ] = (2π G) * sqrt( G M )/(2 pi a^(3/2) )

Wait, let me compute [2π G/(P)]:

= 2 π G / [ sqrt( (4 π² a^3)/(G M) ) ) ]

Simplify denominator: sqrt( (4 π² a^3)/(G M) ) ) = (2 π a^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M )

So 2 π G divided by that is 2 π G * sqrt(G M) / (2 π a^(3/2)) )

Simplify: [ G * sqrt(G M) ) ] / a^(3/2) ) 

Which is G^(3/2) * M^(1/2) / a^(3/2) 

Taking the cube root: [ (G^(3/2) M^(1/2) ) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3) = G^(1/2) M^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

So K = [ G^(1/2) M^(1/6) a^(-1/2) ] * ( M_planet sin i ) / M^(2/3) )

Simplify exponents:

M^(1/6 - 2/3) = M^(-1/2 )

So K = ( M_planet sin i ) * [ G^(1/2) M^(-1/2) a^(-1/2) ) ]

Which is K = M_planet * sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt(M) sqrt(a) ) ) * sin i 

But wait, sin i is the sine of the inclination angle. For the radial velocity method, the maximum measurable velocity (when i=90 degrees) is when sin i =1. So I think we can assume that sin i is 1, so it's the maximum possible shift. So K is proportional to M_planet / sqrt(M a )

But from another angle, Kepler's third law can relate a and the period.

Wait, maybe I can express a in terms of the velocity.

Wait, the velocity in the orbit is given by v = 2π a / P. But from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4π² a^3)/(G M ), so a^3 = G M P²/(4 π² )

So a = [ G M P²/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

But I'm not sure if this is the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a ratio of the semi-major axes using the RV data.

Since K is proportional to (M_planet) / sqrt(a) ) because K = (v) = (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (2π G / P)^(1/3) * sin i. Hmm, perhaps that's not straightforward.

Wait, going back to the earlier expression: K = (M_planet sin i) * sqrt( G / (M a) )

Assuming i=90°, sin i=1. So K = M_planet * sqrt( G/(M a) )

But wait, G is a constant, so K is proportional to sqrt( M_planet / a )

Wait, K ∝ sqrt( (M_planet) / a )

Because sqrt( G / (M a) ) = sqrt( G/(M) * 1/a )

So K = k * sqrt( M_planet / a ), where k is some constant.

So for Planet1 and Planet2:

K1 / K2 = sqrt( ( M1 / a1 ) / ( M2 / a2 ) )

Which is K1/K2 = sqrt( (M1 a2) / (M2 a1) ) )

But solving for a1/a2 ratio:

Square both sides: (K1/K2)^2 = (M1 a2)/(M2 a1 )

Rearranged: a1/a2 = (M2/M1) * (K1/K2)^2

Hmm, but I don't know a1 and a2, but I can find their ratio.

Wait, given that the Doppler shifts are given, which correspond to K1 and K2.

So v1 = K1 = 0.03 Å shift. Wait, no, the shifts are in Å. The Doppler shift is Δλ/λ = v/c. So the actual velocity is v = c * (Δλ/λ )

But the problem says that for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 Å in the line at 6300 Å. So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Similarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) * c.

So K1 = v1 = (0.03/6300 ) * c.

K2 = v2 = (0.04/6300 ) * c.

So K1/K2 = (0.03/6300) / (0.04/6300 ) ) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So K1/K2 = 0.75.

Now, going back to a1/a2 ratio.

From earlier: a1/a2 = (M2/M1) * (K1/K2)^2.

M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses.

So M2/M1 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

(K1/K2)^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625.

So a1/a2 = (5/7) * (9/16) → wait, wait, 0.75^2 is 0.5625, which is 9/16? Wait, 0.5625 is 9/16? Let me check: 9/16 is 0.5625. Yes.

So a1/a2 = (5/7) * (9/16) = (45)/(112) ≈ 0.4018.

So a1 = (45/112) a2.

Wait, but wait, a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1, a2 that of Planet2. So if a1 is smaller than a2 (since 0.4018 is less than 1), Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2.

Now, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula is:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

Since both planets have the same albedo, as mentioned earlier, it cancels out.

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) )

Simplify: the R_star and 2 cancel out. So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because (a2 / a1) inside the sqrt.

Wait, no: Let me write it correctly.

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

So T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) )

Which is sqrt( (a2)/(a1) )

Because the R_star and 2 in denominator cancel out.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have a1/a2 = 45/112 → a2/a1 = 112/45.

So sqrt(112/45 ) = sqrt( (16 * 7 ) / (9 * 5) ) )

= sqrt( (16/9) * (7/5) ) ) = (4/3) * sqrt(7/5).

Compute sqrt(7/5) ≈ sqrt(1.4) ≈ 1.1832.

So 4/3 is about 1.3333. Multiply by 1.1832: 1.3333 * 1.1832 ≈ 1.577.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(112/45):

112 ÷ 45 = 2.4889.

sqrt(2.4889) ≈ 1.577.

So T1/T2 ≈ 1.577.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the possible options:

Options:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

Hmm, 1.577 isn't an option. That suggests I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, step through the steps again.

Starting from the RV method, K is proportional to (M_planet / sqrt(a)) ?

Wait, earlier I had K = M_planet * sqrt( G/(M a) )

But that might not be correct. Let me re-derive K.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2 π G ) / (P) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * [ 1 / sqrt(1 - e²) ]

Assuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ [ (2 π G ) / P )^(1/3) ) ] * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G M_star )

So P = sqrt( (4 π² a³ )/(G M_star) )

Substitute into K:

K ≈ [ (2 π G ) / ( sqrt(4 π² a³/(G M_star) ) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Simplify denominator inside the cube root:

sqrt(4 π² a³/(G M_star) ) = [4 π² a³/(G M_star)]^(1/2) = (2 π a^(3/2) ) / ( sqrt( G M_star ) )

So,

[ (2 π G ) / ( 2 π a^(3/2) / sqrt( G M_star ) ) ) ]^(1/3) )

Simplify numerator and denominator inside:

(2 π G ) * sqrt( G M_star ) / ( 2 π a^(3/2) )

The 2 π cancels. G*sqrt(G M_star) is G^(3/2) M_star^(1/2).

So inside becomes [ G^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) ) / a^(3/2) ) ]

Taking the cube root: [ G^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 ) = G^(1/2) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

So K ≈ [ G^(1/2) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2) ] * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Simplify the M_star terms: 1/6 - 2/3 = 1/6 -4/6 = -3/6 = -1/2.

So M_star^( -1/2 ), which is 1 / sqrt(M_star).

So,

K ≈ [ G^(1/2) / ( sqrt(M_star) sqrt(a) ) ) ] * M_p sin i.

Hmm, so K ≈ ( M_p * sqrt( G ) ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )

But sqrt(G) is a constant, so K is proportional to M_p / sqrt( a )

Thus, K ∝ M_p / sqrt( a )

So K1/K2 = (M1 / sqrt( a1 )) / (M2 / sqrt( a2 )) ) = ( M1 * sqrt( a2 ) ) / ( M2 * sqrt( a1 ) )

Which is ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

(K1/K2) = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/ a1 )

We can rearrange this to find a1/a2.

Let me write the equation:

(K1/K2) = (M1 / M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Square both sides:

(K1/K2)^2 = ( M1^2 / M2^2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )

Rearranged:

a1 / a2 = ( M1^2 / M2^2 ) * ( (K1/K2)^2 )^{-1} )

So,

a1/a2 = ( M1^2 / M2^2 ) * ( ( K2/K1 )^2 )

Putting in the numbers.

M1 =7, M2=5 → M1^2=49, M2^2=25.

K1=0.03, K2=0.04 → K2/K1=4/3.

So,

( K2/K1 )^2 = (4/3)^2 = 16/9.

So,

a1/a2 = (49/25) * (16/9 ) = (49 * 16 ) / (25 *9 ) → 784 / 225 ≈ 3.484.

Wait, that's a1 is about 3.484 times a2. That can't be right because if a1 is larger than a2, Planet1 is further out, but earlier I thought K1 is smaller than K2, so perhaps the planet is closer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, the question states that both planets induce shifts in the same forbidden line. So, perhaps I inverted K1 and K2 somewhere.

Wait, let me recap. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula I used, and K is larger when the planet is more massive or closer (since the star moves more if the planet is massive or closer).

In this case, Planet1 has K1 =0.03, Planet2 K2=0.04. So K2 is larger than K1. So Planet2 is either more massive or closer than Planet1, or a combination.

But wait, Planet1's mass is 7 Earth masses, Planet2's is 5. So Planet1 is more massive. So if K2 is larger than K1, that suggests that Planet2 is closer, because Planet1 is more massive but has a smaller K.

Hmm, perhaps I should step through the proportionality again.

From K = ( M_p * sqrt( G ) ) / ( sqrt( M_star a ) )

So, K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a )

So, K1 = k * ( M1 / sqrt(a1) ), K2 = k * (M2 / sqrt(a2) )

So K1/K2 = (M1 / sqrt(a1 )) / ( M2 / sqrt( a2 )) )

= ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We know K1/K2 is 0.75, M1=7, M2=5.

So 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

=> sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.75 * (5/7 )

Compute 0.75 *5/7 = (3/4) *5/7 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 15/28 → a2/a1 = (15/28)^2.

Wait, wait no, because sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 15/28 → a2/a1 = (15/28)^2.

Wait, 15 squared is 225, 28 squared is 784. So a2/a1 = 225/784 ≈ 0.287.

So a1/a2 = 784/225 ≈ 3.484.

So a1 is about 3.484 times a2.

So Planet1 is much further away from the star than Planet2.

Now, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

From a1/a2 = 3.484, a2/a1 = 1/3.484 ≈ 0.287.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( 0.287 ) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, that's about 0.536. Looking back at the options, option C is ~0.53.

So the ratio is T1 : T2 ≈ 0.536. So the ratio is approximately 0.53.

Alternatively, let me compute it more accurately.

sqrt(0.287) = ?

Well, sqrt(0.25)=0.5, sqrt(0.36)=0.6.

Compute 0.536^2 = approximately 0.287.

Yes. So the ratio is ~0.53.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's semi-major axis. Since both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out in the ratio. Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio depends only on the semi-major axes of the planets.

The semi-major axis \(a\) can be estimated using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Given the RV shifts for Planet1 (\(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\)) and Planet2 (\(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)), we calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Using the proportionality \(K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{a}}\), we relate the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1 / \sqrt{a_1}}{M_2 / \sqrt{a_2}} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 7\), \(M_2 = 5\), and \(\frac{K_1}{K_2} = 0.75\):

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 0.75 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28}
\]

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{15}{28}\right)^2 = \frac{225}{784}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{784}{225} \approx 3.484
\]

Thus, Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2. The equilibrium temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{225}{784}\):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{225}{784}} = \frac{15}{28} \approx 0.536
\]

This corresponds to a ratio of approximately \(0.53\), which matches option C.

**Answer: C**
