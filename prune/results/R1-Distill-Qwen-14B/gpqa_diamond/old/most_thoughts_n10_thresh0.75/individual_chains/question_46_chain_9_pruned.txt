Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. 

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means the redistribution of substituents across double bonds. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, I think it's ruthenium-based. It's used for ring-closing metathesis and also for breaking and reforming double bonds.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-eneâ€”let me draw its structure. Pent means five carbons. So, the main chain is five carbons, double bond starting at carbon 1. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Or wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong.

Wait, the parent chain is pentene, which is five carbons. The double bond is at position 1, so between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? But wait, that's 1-pentene. But the compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there's a methyl group on C3.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So double bond is 1-2. Then, the third carbon (C3) has a methyl group. So yes, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the main chain is five carbons with a double bond at position 1. So actually, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But now, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on the third
