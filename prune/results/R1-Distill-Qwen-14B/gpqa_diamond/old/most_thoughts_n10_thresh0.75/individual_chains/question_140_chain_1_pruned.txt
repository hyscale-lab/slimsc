Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and releases B when heated. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Plus, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let me list what I know. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's an acid-base reaction or something exothermic. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, that means the molecule is made up of an atom where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Because a molecule's neutrons and protons are the same, so each atom in the molecule must have that property.

Wait, the molecule of gas W must have the same number of neutrons and protons. So if W is a molecule, like H2O or something else, but each atom in W must have equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about atoms with that property. For example, deuterium has 1 proton and 1 neutron. But wait, that's just for hydrogen. Are there others? Let's see. Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if the gas is CO2, but wait, each carbon in CO2 is C-12, so each C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But then each O in CO2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons? Wait, oxygen-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So if W is CO2, each atom in CO2 would have equal protons and neutrons. But wait, the molecule would have 3 atoms, each with 6+8=14 (but wait, that's not the same for all atoms). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. So each atom in the molecule is something like H (
