Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's think this through. 

First, I remember that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian depends on the fields and other factors in that term. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. 

Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, γ matrices are dimensionless because they're just coefficients in the Dirac equation. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless since it's made from the commutator of γ matrices. 

So now, the term is κ times ψ̄ times σ_{μν} times ψ times F^{μν}. Let me break down the dimensions of each part.

The Dirac fields ψ have a mass dimension. I think in four dimensions, the Dirac field ψ has dimension 3/2. Because in the Dirac Lagrangian, L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. The kinetic term must have dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ=c=1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, the kinetic term is iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So ψ̄ ψ ∂ must be dimension 4. So ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. Because 3/2 + 3/2 +1 (from ∂) = 4. So yeah, ψ has [ψ] = 3/2.

Now, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism. The field strength tensor F_{μν} has a mass dimension of 2. Because the Maxwell term is -(1/4) F^μν F_{μν}, which is dimension 4. Each F has dimension 2, so two of them make 4, and the term is okay.

So putting it all together, each field's dimension:

ψ̄ is the same as ψ, which is 3/2.

σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

F^{μν} is 2.

So the term is κ * (ψ̄) (σ) (ψ) (F). So the dimensions would be:

κ * (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) * (2). Wait, no, each ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So the product is:

κ * [ψ̄] [σ] [ψ] [F] = κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, [σ] is zero, so it's just κ multiplied by (3/2 * 3/2 * 2).

Calculating that: (3/2)*(3/2) = 9/4; 9/4 *2 =
