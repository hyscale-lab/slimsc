Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. The operator A_y is given as c·S, where c is h over 4π, and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And we're supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The question then gives four options, and I need to determine which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues relate to the possible values of the component. For spin-1/2 particles, like the muon, the eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2, but I need to double-check that.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the operator A_y. The given S matrix is actually the Pauli matrix for the y-component. Oh right! The Pauli matrices, σy is the same as this S matrix. Because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is σy.

But wait, the operator A_y is c multiplied by S. So A_y = c * σy.

What's the value of c here? c is h/(4π). Hmm, Planck's constant h, but in quantum mechanics, we often use ħ which is h/(2π). Wait, let me compute c. c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) ) = (ħ) / 2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * σy.

Now, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any that directly reference ħ. Let me see.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues of A_y should be real numbers, right? Because A_y is Hermitian, being part of angular momentum.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±½, real parts ±1. That also seems off because eigenvalues should be real. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum operator, so its eigenvalues would be (ħ²)(s(s+1)) for spin s. Since the muon is spin-1/2, A² has eigenvalues (ħ²)(3/4). If A_y and A² share eigenvectors, that would make sense because in quantum mechanics, commuting operators can share eigenvectors. Wait, but A_y and A² commute? Let me think. For
