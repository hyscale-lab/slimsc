Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about an electron's state and calculating probabilities and an average value for an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

The state vector is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin-up and spin-down states are orthonormal. 

First, I think I need to normalize |alpha>. Because the coefficients aren't normalized yet. The state is proportional, so I should find the normalization factor. To normalize, I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself and then divide each component by the square root of that.

So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me write it as a vector. In the basis |up>, |down>, the vector is [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T. The inner product is (1+i)(1-i)/2 + (2-i)(2+i)/2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you compute the inner product, you take the conjugate transpose. So the normalization factor squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values.

So for the first component, |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Second component, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. So the state is as given, but when computing probabilities, I probably need to normalize it first.

Next, the operator's matrix representation is given. The elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so let me think about the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix (since we have |up> and |down>), the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Hmm, that's an interesting operator. I'm trying to remember what kind of operator this is. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X operator scaled. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X. So A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. So the eigenstates of A will be the same as those of σ_x, because they are proportional. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A are ±hbar/2.

So if I want to find the probability of measuring the electron in each eigen
