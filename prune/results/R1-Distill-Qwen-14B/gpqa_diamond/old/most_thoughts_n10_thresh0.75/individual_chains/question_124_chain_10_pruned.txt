Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that particles are collided and produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls.

Wait, so I need to find the Lorentz factor that would result in two-thirds (about 66.67%) of the particles reaching the detector. Let's think about what affects whether a particle reaches the wall.

I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Because of that, they can travel farther before decaying. The detector's radius is 30 meters, so the path length the particle travels before hitting the wall is related to the time it has before decaying.

So, the particles are produced at the center of the detector, right? So the distance they need to travel to reach the inner wall is 30 meters. Wait, no, the detector's radius is 30 meters, so if they're moving at a certain velocity, their path length is 30 meters. But wait, they're moving in a straight line towards the wall, so the distance is 30 meters.

The key here is the particle's lifetime. The proper lifetime (in the particle's rest frame) is tau. But in the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the particle's speed is v, which is approximately equal to c for ultra-relativistic particles. So, the time it takes to reach the wall (t) can be found by t = distance / speed. Since v ≈ c, t ≈ 30 m / c. Let's compute that. The speed of light c is about 3e8 meters per second. So t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds, which is 10^-7 seconds.

The proper lifetime is tau, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. The particle will decay during its flight if the lab lifetime is less than the time it takes to reach the wall. Wait, no. Let me think again. If the time it takes to reach the wall is t, and the lifetime is longer than t, then the particle will survive until it reaches the wall. Otherwise, it decays before.

Wait, no. The probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall depends on the ratio of the flight time to the mean lifetime. If the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, it's more likely to survive.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau. So the expected time until decay is gamma * tau. The time to reach the wall is t = 30 / (v). Since v ≈ c, t ≈ 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 s. So the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is P = 1 - exp(-t / (gamma * tau)).

Wait, no, wait. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays before time t is P = 1 - exp(-t / (gamma * tau)).

But wait, wait, I might be getting that wrong. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the probability that the particle has decayed by time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Alternatively, the probability that it reaches the wall is the probability that it hasn't decayed by time t. So that's exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So, when the Lorentz factor is 20, one third reach the wall. So the probability of reaching is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me rephrase. Let’s denote gamma as the Lorentz factor. So when gamma is 20, the probability of reaching the wall is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( - t / (gamma * tau) )

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(1/3) = - t/(gamma tau)

Which simplifies to:

ln(3) = t/(gamma tau)

So, gamma tau = t / ln(3).

But when gamma increases, the denominator increases, so the probability exp(-t/(gamma tau)) would decrease. So if gamma increases, the survival probability (reaching the wall) decreases. But wait, when gamma increases, gamma*tau increases, so t/(gamma tau) decreases, so exp(-x) increases when x is smaller.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The survival probability is
