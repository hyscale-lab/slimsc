Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are four different acetates: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, and Trans-butenyl acetates.

Let me think about each of these structures. First, I need to recall what the structures of these compounds look like. 

So, propenyl acetate would have an acetate group (OAc) attached to a propenyl group. Propenyl is CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. So propenyl could be either cis or trans, but wait, propenyl is a three-carbon group with a double bond. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is it CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond?

Wait, actually, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, acetate is OAc- as the leaving group, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or alternatively, maybe it's CH3CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. Similarly, butenyl is a four-carbon group with a double bond. So butenyl could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc, but maybe I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the four options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, with cis or trans configurations. So the structures I'm considering are:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: The double bond is in the propenyl group, and the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side.

But wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-OAc with a methyl group attached? No, no, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so acetate would be CH2=CHCH
