Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit confused but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about some reactions involving mixtures X and Y, and a substance Z. The goal is to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A to D, with numbers ranging from 12 to 22. 

First, let me parse the problem. The starting point is mixture X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means they have double bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, because they can undergo addition reactions. So, the two components in X are probably alkenes or maybe something else reactive.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction that leads to mixture Y. This reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, so maybe each component undergoes a different reaction. Or perhaps each component of X disproportionates into two different substances in Y.

Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the products don't have double bonds anymore. So maybe the double bonds have been hydrogenated or something else has happened. But wait, the next part says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only one substance Z. So when X and Y are hydrogenated, they end up with the same product, Z.

Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen across double bonds. So if mixture X has alkenes, hydrogenation would turn them into alkanes. If Y doesn't decolorize bromine, perhaps Y's components are single bonds, so they don't react further. But wait, the problem says that the hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, which is a certain hydrocarbon. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, form the same Z. That suggests that X and Y are related in a way that their hydrogenation leads to the same product. Maybe Y is a partially hydrogenated form or a different structure that upon hydrogenation becomes Z.

Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Let me calculate that. The mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428. Let's assume Z is a hydrocarbon with formula CnH2n+2 (since it's a hydrocarbon from hydrogenation, probably an alkane). Wait, but wait, Z is a constituent of Y and is a solvent, which makes me think of something like hexane or another alkane, but let me think about the hydrogen percentage.

Let me calculate the molecular formula based on the given H percentage. Let's say Z has molar mass M. The mass of H is 14.28% of M, so (mass H) = 0.1428*M. Since Z is a hydrocarbon, it's CnH2m (maybe), but more likely, for an alkane, it's CnH2n+2. Let me compute the percentage for various n.

Wait, hydrogen's atomic weight is about 1.008.
