Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know about this.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point r and time t. The charge q is moving with some trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at time t, which is later than the time tr when the charge was at the position that generated the field. So t is greater than tr. 

I think potentials are usually expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity. Since the charge is moving, the potentials would depend on both its position and velocity at the earlier time tr. 

Wait, the options involve expressions with d, which is the vector from the field generating point to the observation point. So d is the displacement between where the charge was at tr and where we're observing now. Let me think. Oh right, because the charge's position affects the potentials, and since it's moving, the vector d would be the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r.

The scalar potential V is usually given by the static Coulomb potential, but since the charge is moving, I think there might be some correction. Oh wait, for a moving charge, the scalar potential might not just be the simple Coulomb potential because of the motion affecting the fields. Or wait, maybe the scalar potential is similar to the static case but scaled by some factor related to the velocity or time delays.

Wait, no. I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. The scalar potential V for a charge in the Coulomb gauge is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - r'|), where r' is the position of the charge at time t'. But since the charge is moving, and we're considering retarded time, the position r' is actually r' = (r) - v*(t - t'), but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is still (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - r_tr|), where r_tr is the position at the retarded time tr. Because the scalar potential is a scalar, it might not directly involve the velocity. But
