Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again and break it down.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shone vertically onto this aperture, and it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with diffraction patterns, the far-field or Fraunhofer diffraction is what's happening here. The aperture shape affects the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22λ/(diameter), I think. But this is a polygon with many sides—so as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Wait, but wait, the apothem is given. Let me think about the apothem.

The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a polygon with N sides, each side length is s = 2a tan(π/N). But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. The radius of that circle would be related to the apothem.

Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the middle of a side. For a regular polygon, the radius (the distance from center to a vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). As N becomes very large, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π^2)/(2N²), but for large N, cos(π/N) ≈ 1. So R ≈ a. So the radius of the circle would approach 'a' as N becomes very large.

Wait, wait, but the actual shape when N is large is a circle of radius a (since the apothem is a). That would imply that the diameter is 2a. But wait, no, wait—the apothem isn't the same as the radius. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, which for a regular polygon is a = R cos(π/N), where R is the radius (distance from center to a vertex). So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a / cos(0) ) = a / 1 = a. So the radius is a, meaning the diameter is 2a.

So for a circular aperture of diameter D = 2a, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at θ = 1.22 λ / D. Substituting D=2a, the equation becomes θ = 1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a. Hmm, that's one of the options. Option A is 0.610 λ/a, so that would match.

But wait, the question says the apothems are all the same length a. So when N is large, it's a circle with radius a, but wait, no, because the apothem
