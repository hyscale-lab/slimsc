Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, each spin has two states, so three spins should have 2^3 = 8 possible states. Right. So I need to consider all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

But directly computing each state's energy might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the energy expression. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of pairs. So for each pair, when the spins are aligned (same), their product is +1, else -1. Since the energy is -J times the sum, each aligned pair contributes -J*(1), and anti-aligned contributes -J*(-1) which is +J.

So the total energy E is -J times (number of aligned pairs - number of anti-aligned pairs). Because if all pairs are aligned, you get 3 aligned, sum is 3*1, so E = -3J. If two are aligned and one is anti, sum is 2 -1 =1, E = -J. Wait, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, sum S_i S_j for each pair. So for three spins, the number of pairs is 3: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3.

Each pair contributes S_i S_j. So if all spins are same, each pair product is 1. So sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

If two spins are same, and one is opposite. Let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly. If all spins are same, each of the three pairs S_i S_j is 1. So total sum is 3. Multiply by -J: E = -3J.

If two spins are same, and third different. Let's say S1 = S2 = 1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 = 1. S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, but is that correct? Because E = -J*(sum). So sum is -1, so E is J.

Wait, another case: all three spins are different. Oh, wait, each spin is either +1 or -1. So all three can't be different. Because you can have all three as +1, or two +1 and one -1, etc. Wait, but three spins can't all be different because each is either +1 or -1. So possible scenarios are: all same, two same one different, or all different (but that's impossible because you can't have three different values with each being ±1. So the possible cases are all same, two same and one opposite.

Wait, no, wait. Each spin is either +1 or -1. So for three spins, the possibilities are:

1. All three same: S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1. So two cases.

2. Two same, one different. Let me count how many such cases. For each choice of which spin is different, two possibilities for the value.

So for three spins, each can be +1 or -1. How many states are there where exactly two are same and one is different? Let's think: For each arrangement, choose which spin is different. There are 3 choices (either S1, S2, or S3 is
