Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with the ability of a compound to rotate plane-polarized light. That usually occurs when there's a chiral center in the molecule. Oh right, a chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry or an internal center of inversion, it won't be chiral and thus won't show optical activity.

The question gives me four different organic moieties and asks which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let me look at each one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl structures can sometimes have some interesting stereochemistry. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. If both substituents are in the same positions on each ring, does that create a chiral center? Or maybe the biphenyl itself could have some kind of asymmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are symmetrical, the molecule might not be chiral. But wait, the substituents here are nitro groups and ester groups. Are they arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral?

Wait, biphenyl compounds can have two configurations: ortho and para, but I'm not sure how that relates to chirality. Alternatively, in such a compound, if the substituents on the two phenyl rings are in positions that make the entire structure asymmetric, then it could have stereoisomerism. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: if the substituents are in such a way that their arrangement makes the molecule lack a plane of symmetry, then it might have optical isomerism. So for 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the two rings have substituents on opposite sides, maybe that leads to chirality. Because each ring has two substituents, but their positions relative to each other might affect the symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent on the biphenyl is in a position that creates asymmetry. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one yet. I'll come back to it.

2. The second compound is methyl
