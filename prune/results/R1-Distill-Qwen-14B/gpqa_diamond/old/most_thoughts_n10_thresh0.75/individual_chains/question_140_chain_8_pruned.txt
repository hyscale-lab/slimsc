Okay, I'm going to try to work through this chemistry problem. So, let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, I think I need to break this down. Let's start by identifying each component.

First, gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule has an equal number of n and p. What gases fit this? Well, noble gases have monoatomic molecules, so for example, He (2 protons, 2 neutrons if it's the isotope He-4), but wait, He is He-4 only has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so n and p are equal. So maybe W is helium? Or another noble gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where the total number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Like, O2 would have 8 p and 8 n each, so total 16 p and 16 n. Wait, but the problem says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, wait, for each molecule, the sum of all the atoms' protons and the sum of all their neutrons are equal.

Wait, for O2: Each O has 8 p and 8 n (assuming it's O-16). So two O atoms: 16 p, 16 n. So 16=16, yes. So W could be O2. But wait, other possibilities. Alternatively, maybe CO2 is the gas? No, CO2 is a molecule, but not sure. Let me think of other possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2. Each H has 1 p and 0 or 1 n. Oh wait, H can have isotopes. If
