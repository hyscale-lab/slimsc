Okay, so I've got this science question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with gene expression constructs and their expression in mice. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question describes a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors contain two open reading frames (ORFs) in one construct, allowing the expression of two proteins. The vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So, the ligand is first, then the receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA stands for Cytomegalovirus Immediate-Early promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so the ligand should be expressed from that. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, which can support the expression of a second ORF in a bicistronic construct. So, the receptor would be expressed under the control of the IRES, which is weaker than the CBA promoter.

Looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. So, when Cre is present, these cassettes can be excised, allowing the expression of the downstream gene. Similarly, between the receptor ORF and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I think lox2272 is another variant of the loxP site that only Cre can recognize, but I'm not sure if that matters here.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte cultures and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. On a Western blot, they see signals proportional to actin loading. Wait, but the question is about why there's no green signal in the mouse model.

The mice are homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression under the control of SOX10 regulatory elements, meaning Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes perhaps.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal, which is from eGFP. But they don't see any green. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, perhaps the eGFP would be expressed elsewhere, but I'm not sure how this explains the lack of eGFP in the samples. Also, the vector's expression would be in the same cell, so perhaps this isn't the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP would be expressed if the receptor is properly trafficked. If it's stuck, maybe it doesn't fluoresce. But why wouldn't the Western blot show the receptor? Well, the Western blot was tested in vitro with transfected astrocytes, but the mouse model's expression might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the construct isn't being expressed correctly.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. So they shouldn't need an enhancer for expression. Or maybe the promoter isn't sufficient in the mouse, but in the Western blot in vitro, it worked. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed properly. Wait, but the construct is designed with the receptor ORF followed by eGFP with a stop cassette in between. Oh wait, the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So, without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent eGFP expression. Because, in the vector, the receptor is followed by a lox2272 stop cassette, then eGFP. So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassette is in place, preventing translation from the receptor into eGFP. So the eGFP would only be expressed if Cre excises the stop cassette, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be in frame.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct. So, the first ORF is ligand with mCherry, and the second is receptor with eGFP. But each has a stop cassette
