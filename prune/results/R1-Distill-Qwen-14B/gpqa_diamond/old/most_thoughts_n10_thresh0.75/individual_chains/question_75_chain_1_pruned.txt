Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model to study the role of GADD45G protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They introduced a construct with the coding sequence for GADD45G, but with a modification: a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected the cells (Chinese hamster ovary) using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the problem, the issue is why the protein isn't being expressed. The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of their construct. The question is pointing towards a reason in the options given.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each possible option.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm. So if the HA tag is not correctly inserted, maybe the protein isn't expressed. But wait, the problem says the construct was modified by introducing the HA sequence. If there's a mutation in the HA, perhaps the tag isn't present. But would that prevent the whole protein from being expressed? Or would it just affect purification? Maybe if the mutation causes a frameshift or a premature stop, but that would require more analysis.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. That would imply a stop codon before the end. Let's look at the DNA sequence. The last few lines of the sequence: ...GAGTGA3'. The last part ends with TGA. DNA is read as coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. Let me think: the last part of the plus strand is TGA, so the mRNA would be complementary to thatâ€”so mRNA would have UAC. Wait, no. Wait, the plus strand is the same as mRNA, so the plus strand's TGA would be the same as mRNA's TGA. TGA is a stop codon. So if the coding sequence ends with TGA, that would be a stop codon. Wait, but that's the very end of the sequence. Let me check the end of the sequence.

Looking at the very end: ...GCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last codons would be CGA, GAG, TGA. Wait, no, reading the DNA as mRNA (plus strand is same as mRNA), the last triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

So the construct has a stop codon at the end. But wait, in the construct, they added the HA tag at the N-terminus, and the rest of the GADD45G sequence. So the HA tag is at the beginning, followed by GADD45G, and the construct ends with TGA. So the mRNA should have the HA sequence
