Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

Alright, the problem says we have a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin components are quantized. Sz can be ± ħ/2, right? So the magnetic moment mu would be gamma times that. But when the magnetic field is applied, it affects the energy levels of the particle.

Originally, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. So the Hamiltonian would be something like H_initial = -mu·B, which in this case would simplify because the field is along Z. So H_initial = -gamma B Sz. Since B is along +Z, the energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of Sz.

But then the magnetic field is turned off and another one along Y is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu·B', where B' is along Y. So H_final = -gamma B S_y. Wait, because mu is gamma times the spin. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma S_z. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So mu is proportional to the z-component of spin. So when the field is along Z, that makes sense because the interaction is H = -mu·B, which would be -gamma B S_z. But when the field is along Y, the interaction becomes H = -gamma B S_y. Oh, because B is along Y. So the Hamiltonian switches from depending on Sz to Sy.

Wait, but initially, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz. So when the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and the new field is applied along Y, the state of the particle doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state is still an eigenstate of Sz, but now the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, which doesn't commute with Sz.
