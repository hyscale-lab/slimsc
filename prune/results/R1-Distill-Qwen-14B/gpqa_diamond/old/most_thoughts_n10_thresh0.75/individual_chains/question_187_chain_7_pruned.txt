Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy, right? I think it's used for things like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method. But for this question, I need to focus on the S/N ratio.

I recall that the S/N depends on factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency. So the S/N formula might look something like S/N = (flux * exposure time * efficiency) / noise, but I'm not exactly sure of the precise formula.

Wait, I think S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time, so for a 1-hour exposure, longer is better. But all our options are for 1-hour, so that's fixed.

The key thing here is the apparent magnitude of each star because a brighter star (lower magnitude) would give a higher S/N. The absolute magnitude is given, but we'll need to calculate the apparent magnitude using distance.

The apparent magnitude (m) can be found using the distance modulus: m - M = 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. So m = M + 5 log(d/10).

Let me compute the apparent magnitude for each star.

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star. I remember its apparent magnitude is about -0.74. So that's way brighter than the others. So this should be detectable.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is a well-known star, the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2.0 or so. Wait, I'm not certain. I'll check my memory. I think it's about 1.97, but I'm not 100% sure. Anyway, it's a bright star, so S/N should be good.

Option c) Star with M=15, distance 10pc. Let's compute m. m =15 + 5*log(10/10) =15 +5*0=15. So apparent magnitude 15. That's very dim. Wait, but for what's detectable, I think ESPRESSO's capability is important. I remember that ESPRESSO is more suited for brighter stars. Wait, but how faint can it go?

Wait, maybe I should think about what's the typical limit. I think that ESPRESSO is designed for stars down to about magnitude 19 or 20? So a star of magnitude 15 would be much brighter than the limit. So it would be detectable. Wait, but wait, that depends on the exposure time. Hmm.

Wait, but another factor: the distance. The star in
