Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X with a given mass. Let me see what I can figure out.

Alright, the problem statement says that the bosonic field X interacts with fermions through the Lagrangian given by:

L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y)

Wait, wait. Hmm, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, the actual interaction term is probably something like L = λ ψ† ψ X(y), but perhaps it's better to not get too bogged down by the exact form. The key point is that the boson X couples to fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

Wait, but in particle physics, when a boson decays into fermions, the fermion species (like quarks or leptons) must have a mass less than half of the boson's mass because each fermion and antifermion would take away some energy. So the condition is 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

But wait, I should remember that for fermions, the mass is given, and for particles like quarks, the masses are a bit tricky because they are constituent masses, but for the purpose of decay kinematics, I think we consider the current masses. Let me list the approximate masses of the fermions.

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2 MeV
- Down (d): ~5 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (actually, around 100 MeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV (about 1.5 GeV)
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV (approximately 4.7 GeV)
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos (ν): nearly 0, but since their mass is negligible, they can be considered as allowed but the decay would produce a neutrino and anti-neutrino, but in the problem statement, the options have e+ e-, mu+ mu-, etc., but not neutrinos. So probably X decays into charged leptons or quarks.

Wait, but the interaction term given is for fermions ψf, so maybe it's any fermion, but more likely the problem is considering charged fermions because the decay products are in the form
