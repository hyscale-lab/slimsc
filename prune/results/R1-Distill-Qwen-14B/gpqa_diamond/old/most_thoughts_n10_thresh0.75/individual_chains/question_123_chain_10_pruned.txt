Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about supernova ejecta traveling towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

The question says that the ejecta part and the galaxy are both inertial frames of reference. That means we don't have to worry about acceleration, which simplifies things a bit. The ejecta's part is moving towards the galaxy's center at 60,000 km/s according to the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that means in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at the same speed, right? Because if frame A sees B moving at v, then frame B sees A moving at -v, assuming they're moving directly towards each other.

So the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy center. Now, the question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait, but wait. There's a time component here. Because the time in the ejecta's frame is different from the time in the galaxy's frame due to time dilation. Oh right, special relativity comes into play because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let's convert that to meters per second. Oh wait, 60,000 km is 6e4 km = 6e7 meters. Wait, no, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s = 6e7 meters per second? Wait, no, wait: 1 km is 1e3 meters. So 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 is about 20% the speed of light. So yeah, relativistic effects matter here.

So I can't just use the simple v = d/t formula because the time experienced in one frame isn't the same as the other.

So I think we need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity. Time dilation factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v is 6e7 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute beta first: beta = v/c = (6e7) / (3e8) = 0.2. So beta is 0.2, which is 20% the speed of light.

Now, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.98 (since 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96, so let's see... wait, 0.98^2 is 0
