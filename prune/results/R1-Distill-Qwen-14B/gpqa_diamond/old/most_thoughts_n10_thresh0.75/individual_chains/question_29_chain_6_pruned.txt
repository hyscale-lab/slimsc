Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and see what it's about.

Alright, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that produces an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene sequences. Some changes are in the first exon area. We need to find which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The goal is to get rid of the anti-nutritional compound. So probably, we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. How do mutations disrupt gene function? Well, it could be a nonsense mutation causing a premature stop codon, missense mutations altering the protein, or maybe a frameshift that completely changes the downstream amino acids.

Looking at the gene sequences provided, each mutant has a different change in the first exon. Let's compare them to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Let me write each mutant's sequence and see where they differ.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, the second codon is TTT in the intact, here it's TTC. So the second codon changes. Let's see: TTT is Phe, and TTC is also Phe. So that's a silent mutation; no effect on the amino acid. Then, the next part, the intact has CTG, which is Leu. In mutant 1, it's CGC. Wait, CTG is Leu, CGC is also Leu? Wait, no: CTG is Leucodon, and CGC is also a Leucodon. So the third codon changes, same amino acid. Then, the next part: GCT in the intact? Wait, let me look again.

Wait, maybe I should number the positions. Let me look at the first part where they differ.

Looking at the start, the intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA etc.

Mutant 1's sequence: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... Hmm.

Wait, let's compare each part.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

So the first three nucleotides are ATG (start, same). Then, TTT in intact is TTC in mutant 1. Wait, no: wait, the intact is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA... So the second codon in intact is TTT (Phe). In mutant
