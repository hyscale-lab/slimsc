Okay, so I've got this question about Klinefelter's syndrome and why its symptoms are less severe compared to Down's syndrome. Hmm, let me think. I remember that Klinefelter's is when a boy has an extra X chromosome, so his karyotype is XXY instead of the usual XY. Down's is when there's an extra chromosome 21, so trisomy 21.

The question is asking why Klinefelter's has less severe phenotypic consequences. I think it's because the extra X in Klinefelter's is usually inactivated. Oh wait, that's right, the inactivation of the extra X forms a Barr body. So the cells effectively have one active X and one inactive, like females do with their two X's.

But how does this relate to the molecular mechanisms in the options? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote. Methylation is an epigenetic change, which affects gene expression. But how does that tie in to the inactivation of the X? Oh, X inactivation involves XIST RNA and the formation of a Barr body, which is a form of gene silencing. I think that process involves chromatin modification, maybe methylation. So this could be a possible reason why the extra X doesn't cause as many issues.

Option B: Progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst. Polymerase alpha is involved in DNA replication, I think, specifically primase activity. The morula and blastocyst are early胚胎 stages. Not sure how this relates to the inactivation of the X. Maybe not the right option.

Option C: Attachment of spindle to kinetochores in metaphase I. This sounds like it's about chromosome segregation during meiosis. If the attachment is incorrect, like in Down's where there's trisomy, maybe that's involved. But Klinefelter's is more about an XXY, which arises from the father contributing an X instead of Y, or the mother contributing an extra X. But that's about meiosis, not the phenotypic consequences, which are about gene expression.

Option D: Chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis. Chiasmata are the crossover points during meiosis. Separase is an enzyme that cleaves cohesin proteins, allowing sister chromatids to separate. This is part of meiosis I. If this process is faulty, you might get errors in chromosome separation, leading to conditions like Down's. But again, this is about the cause, not the effect on phenotype.

So why is Klinefelter's less severe? Because the extra X is inactivated, leading to it not being expressed. This inactivation is an epigenetic process involving methylation, which silences the genes on that X. So the molecular mechanism here is the methylation that inactivates the X, reducing the number of active X chromosomes to one, similar to females.

Looking at the options, option A is about chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases post-zygote. So that's probably the correct answer because it's about the epigenetic silencing that reduces the impact of the extra X.


Klinefelter's syndrome occurs when a boy has an XXY karyotype due to the presence of an extra X chromosome. Unlike Down's syndrome, which involves trisomy 21 and results in significant phenotypic consequences, Klinefelter's syndrome is less severe because the extra X chromosome is typically inactivated through a process called X inactivation. This inactivation involves the formation of a Barr body, where one X chromosome is silenced, effectively reducing the number of active X chromosomes to one, similar to females. This silencing is an epigenetic process that involves chromatin methylation, which suppresses gene expression on the inactive X chromosome.

Among the options provided, the most relevant molecular mechanism is chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote. This process explains why the extra X chromosome in Klinefelter's syndrome does not lead to the same severity of phenotypic effects as the trisomy 21 seen in Down's syndrome.
