Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.

The question is about a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, they undergo a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y of two other liquids which don't decolorize bromine water. When both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they produce a single hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent widely used, like maybe something common. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturatedâ€”no double bonds left.

Moreover, mixture X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds in their molecules. So each molecule in X can have multiple bonds, but they're not conjugated. Hmm.

Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That usually suggests that X contains double bonds because alkenes or alkynes can decolorize bromine. But since it's a mixture of two liquids, perhaps they are alkenes. But wait, the question says that X decolorizes bromine, but Y doesn't. So what happens when X is treated with Pt and heated? It undergoes a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, wait. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, H2O2 can decompose into H2O and O2. So in this case, the mixture X's components are undergoing disproportionation, leading to Y.

But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps the two components in X are undergoing a reaction where each component is undergoing a change. Or maybe each component is a diene or something that can split into different products.

Wait, but Y is also a mixture of two liquids, and their products don't decolorize bromine. So, Y's components don't have double bonds? Or maybe their double bonds are in a different form that doesn't react with bromine.

Wait, let's think about the hydrogenation step. When X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they produce only one substance Z. So both X and Y's components, when hydrogenated, give Z. Therefore, Z must be a fully saturated compound, perhaps an alkane.

Because if Z is an alkane, it won't react with hydrogen anymore. Also, the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that corresponds to.

Mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, suppose the molecular formula of Z is CnH2n. Wait, but wait, if it's an alkane, it's CnH2n+2. Let's think.

Wait, the mass of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is about 1/7. So the formula would have H contributing 1/7 of the total molecular weight.

Let me compute that. Let me assume Z is an alkane, so formula is CnH2n+2.

The molecular weight would be (12n) + (2n+2)(1) = 14n + 2.

The mass percent of hydrogen is [(
