Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. And there are four options (A to D) with different sequences. Hmm, let's think this through step by step.

First, I'll try to draw the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group is attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one means a two-carbon chain with a ketone at the end). On the phenyl ring, there are two substituents: a bromo group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering starts from the ketone attachment. So the positions would be like this: the ketone is at position 1, then bromo at 3 (which is two positions away), and nitro at 5 (four positions away). Let me visualize that.

Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1,3,5? Wait no, because position 1 is the ketone. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So the substituents are meta and para to each other? Hmm, no. Let me think again. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. So it's a 1-phenyl group attached to the ketone. The substituents on the benzene ring are at 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). So the ring has three substituents: ketone at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. Wait, that would be a 3,5-dihydroxyphenyl group, but in this case, bromo and nitro.

Now, the synthesis starts from benzene. So I need to plan the steps to introduce these groups in the correct positions.

The target molecule has three substituents: -C(O)CH3 (since ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-), Br, and NO2 groups. But wait, the ketone
