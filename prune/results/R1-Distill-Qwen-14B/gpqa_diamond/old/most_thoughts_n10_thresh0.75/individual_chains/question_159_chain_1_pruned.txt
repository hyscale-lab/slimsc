Okay, so I have to figure out the comoving distance to a quasar based on some observations and given cosmological parameters. Hmm, let's think.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that, which I think means the light is being redshifted. Oh wait, because if the peak is at 790 nm but it's originally emitted at a shorter wavelength, that would imply it's been redshifted. Like, if the quasar emits in optical, but we see it in near-infrared, the wavelength has stretched due to expansion of the universe.

So, the observed wavelength λ_obs is 790 nm. I remember that the relation between observed and emitted wavelengths is λ_obs = (1 + z) * λ_emit. But what's the emitted wavelength? Well, quasars often have emission lines like Lyman alpha at around 121 nm, but the peak here is at 790 nm. Wait, maybe it's a broad emission line or something else. Alternatively, maybe the rest frame peak is in the optical. Let me think. If the peak is in the near-infrared for us, but in the rest frame it's in the optical, that suggests a redshift.

Wait, let's think about the peak. 790 nm is near-infrared. So if the quasar is at a high redshift, what would that imply about the emitted wavelength? For example, if the emitted peak is in the optical, say around 500 nm (green), then (1+z) = 790 / 500 = about 1.58. So z ≈ 0.58. Alternatively, if the emitted peak is in the UV, like 121 nm (Lyman alpha), then (1+z) = 790/121 ≈ 6.529, so z≈5.529. Wow, that's a high redshift.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance at a=1 (which is now), so we need to compute the comoving distance for that redshift. Wait, no, comoving distance is a function of redshift. So, but how do I find the redshift first?

Wait, the peak in the spectrum is due to some emission line. Let's assume that the quasar
