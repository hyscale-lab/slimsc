Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a molecule with multiple double bonds and substituents. I think it might have two double bonds because I see C=C appearing twice. Let me count the carbons quickly. Each (CH3)2 group is two methyl groups attached to a carbon, so maybe it's a symmetrical molecule. But perhaps that's not too important right now.

The question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this hydrocarbon, the formation would be from carbon (probably graphite) and hydrogen gas.

Wait, but how does enthalpy of atomization fit into this? Oh right, the atomization enthalpy is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to produce its atoms. For carbon, that's 1000 kJ/mol. So each C-C bond, right? Because in graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but maybe that's for later.

The approach to calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is to consider the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. The general formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, for formation, the reactants are elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, the reactants would be C (graphite) and H2 gas. The product is the given hydrocarbon.

But when calculating using bond energies, I think the formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products]

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think. When a molecule is formed from its elements, the bonds in the molecule form, and the bonds in the elements (like H2 and C) are broken.

But bond energies are typically the energy released when bonds form. So when bonds form, energy is released (exothermic), and when bonds break, energy is absorbed (endothermic).

So the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products)

Wait, no. Let's get this straight. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements. So, the process is:

Elements → Compound.

The bonds in the elements (like H2 and C) are broken (endothermic), and new bonds form in the compound (exothermic). So the total enthalpy change is the sum of energies required to break bonds minus the sum of energies released when new bonds form.

So, the equation is:

ΔHf = (Σ Bond energies of reactants) - (Σ Bond
