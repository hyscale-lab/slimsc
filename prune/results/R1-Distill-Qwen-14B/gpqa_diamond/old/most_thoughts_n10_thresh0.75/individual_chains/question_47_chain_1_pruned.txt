Okay, so I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what each part of the data tells me.

First, the IR data. There are medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because amines or amides typically show peaks in that region. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group (like an ester or amide). Oh wait, but the molecular formula includes an O2 and an N, so maybe it's an amide or an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There's a triplet at 1.20 ppm with 3H. That usually indicates a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group (OCH2CH3). The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so that methyl is probably at the end of an ethyl chain.

Then, a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an -OH group or something with exchange, but wait, in this case, since the IR has N-H, maybe it's an amine or amide proton. But wait, the 4.0 ppm region is more typical for OCH2, like an ether or an ester's oxygenated CH2. But if the singlet is broad, maybe it's an NH group, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, a quartet at 4.5 ppm with 2H. A quartet implies two neighboring protons. So maybe this is an OCH2 group next to another CH2. Like in an ester group, where the ethyl is attached to the oxygen. For example, ethyl esters have a typical quartet around 4.5 ppm. Wait, but in ethyl groups, the CH2 next to the oxygen (like OCH2CH3) would split into a quartet if the neighboring CH3 is split by the adjacent CH2. Hmm, but in the 1H NMR, the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, which would be the CH3, and the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2. So that's pointing towards an ethyl ester group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's a symmetrical substitution, maybe a para-substituted benzene. So the two doublets each with 2H suggest a para-substituted ring, like two substituents opposite each other. So perhaps one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and the other is something else. Alternatively, maybe a substituent with two different groups attached.

Putting this together, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of Unsat = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here X=0, N=1. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3) plus a carbonyl (1) and an amine (1?), maybe. Or another arrangement like a ring and some double bonds.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group in the 3 position. So the benzamide part would have a CONH2 (but wait, the formula here is C9H11NO2. Benzamide is C7H7NO2, so adding ethoxy would add C2H5O, making C9H12NO2? Wait, but our formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, which might have a substitution pattern.

Wait, let me think about each option in more detail.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.
Benzamide is PhCONH2. Adding an ethoxy at position 3 would make it 3-ethoxybenzamide. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me count: Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would replace a H, so C7 becomes C9, H becomes 7 + (5 from ethoxy) - 1 (since replacing a H). Wait, original benzamide has 7 carbons (Ph is C6H5, CONH2 adds 2 more: 6+2=8? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute the formula.

Benzamide is C7H7NO2: benzene (6C, 5H if it's after substitution), CONH2 adds 1C, 2H (since it's a substituent). So 6 C (Ph) + 1 C (CONH2) =7 C. For H: benzene (assuming substitution) has 5 H, plus CONH2 has 2 H (NH2?), but wait benzamide is Ph-C(=O)-NH2. So the benzamide structure is Ph (6C, 5H), then -CONH2 adds 2 C (the carbonyl and the amide) and 2 H (the NH2). Wait, that's 6 + 2 =8 C? Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each option
