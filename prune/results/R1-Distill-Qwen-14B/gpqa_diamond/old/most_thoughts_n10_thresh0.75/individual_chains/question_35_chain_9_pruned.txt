Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and which statement is correct regarding this.

Alright, let me start by breaking down the given information. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, let me write that out:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And Ay = c * S, with c = h/(4π). So substituting c in, Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, but when I think about angular momentum operators, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles like the muon, the Pauli matrices are often involved. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices have the same form as S here, except maybe for a factor. Let me recall: the Pauli sigma matrices are σx, σy, σz. The sigma y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is exactly S here. So S is σy, and the operator Ay is c times σy.

But I'm a bit confused about the units here. Hmm. Let me think about the angular momentum operators. The intrinsic angular momentum S for a spin-1/2 particle is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Wait, because ħ is h/(2π), so S = (ħ/2) σ. So S = (ħ/2) σ. But in this case, the operator Ay is given as c * S, where c = h/(4π). Let me compute c*S.

Wait, c is h/(4π), and S is (ħ/2) σy. Because S is (ħ/2) * σy. So substituting, c*S = (h/(4π)) * (ħ/2) σy. Wait, wait, but ħ is h/(2π),
