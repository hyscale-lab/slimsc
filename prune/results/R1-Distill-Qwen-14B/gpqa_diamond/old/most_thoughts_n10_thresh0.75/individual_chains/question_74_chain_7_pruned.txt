Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that we have an atom, and we know from experiments that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So wait, that's the probability, right? So like, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it's decayed. Or wait, maybe that's the decay constant or the half-life? No, the problem says it's the probability, so I think it's the probability that the atom decays in that time.

Wait, the question says, so far 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Oh wait, that's a bit tricky. Because 50 minutes have already passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. So the remaining time is 150 minutes, but how does that affect the probability?

I remember that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. That is, the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the decay follows an exponential decay model. So the probability that the atom decays in a certain time interval is independent of when you start measuring.

So the decay probability is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. But wait, in this case, the given probability is 32% for 100 minutes. So 32% is P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So from that, I can solve for λ.

Let me compute that. Let's rearrange the equation: e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Calculating that: ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but let me get exact. Wait, 0.68 is about 68% of 1. So ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, but maybe I can just find the decay constant another way. Alternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after t minutes is P(t) = e^(-λ t). So the probability it has decayed after t minutes is 1 - e^(-λ t).

But in the question, the 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So the remaining time is 150 minutes, but the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting now.

Wait, no, because the decay is memoryless, the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the future probabilities. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it would have of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero.

But wait, no. Because the decay probability given was for 100 minutes. So maybe the way to approach this is to find the decay constant λ using the given 32% probability over 100 minutes.

So given P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100), so e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking ln: -100λ = ln(0.68), so λ = - (ln 0.68)/100.

So λ is (ln(1/0.
