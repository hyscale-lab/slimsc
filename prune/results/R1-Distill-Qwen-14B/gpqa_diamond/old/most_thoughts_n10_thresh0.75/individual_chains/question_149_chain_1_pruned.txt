Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks consistent except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. What's going on here?

Let me break it down. The NMR part: same alpha proton appearing as two peaks. They have same shift and same integral together as one. So maybe it's not splitting due to coupling, because the coupling pattern doesn't explain it. The integrals add up to 1H, so each is half. That suggests maybe two environments for that proton, but why?

Wait, possible scenarios for duplicate peaks in NMR: coupling with equivalent nuclei, but the problem says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So maybe diastereotopic protons? Or something else.

In the LC-MS part, two peaks with same mass. So they have the same molecular weight. But in a LC-MS, each peak would correspond to a different compound with the same mass. Could be isomers, like diastereomers or enantiomers. But wait, enantiomers would have same retention times on a regular column. Hmm, but sometimes they might not if the column is chiral. Wait, but the question says it's the same mass and same intensity.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But in the NMR, the extra peaks are from the same alpha proton, so if it's a precursor, might have different H's. Also, LC-MS would show a different mass for the precursor, but the question says the mass is consistent with the expected. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have same molecular formula, same mass. But in the NMR, for each enantiomer, the alpha proton would be in the same environment, so same shift. No, because each enantiomer would have the same environment when in a racemic mixture. Wait, but in the NMR, if it's a racemic mixture
