Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. Let me think through this step by step.

So the given data is: X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle.

Wait, the question is asking about the minimum resolution needed. I think this relates to the time it takes for the particle to decay and how that translates into the distance it travels before decaying. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the particle's lifetime is longer depending on its speed, right?

The resolution, I guess, refers to the detection system's ability to measure the position of the decay. So if the particle travels too far before decaying, maybe it's beyond the resolution of the detector, meaning we can't pinpoint where it decayed. So the minimum resolution would be the maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying, such that at least 30% of the decays are detected.

Wait, but how does that work? Oh, right, the decay length. The particle moves and decays somewhere, and the length it travels before decaying is called the decay length. If the decay length is smaller than the detector's resolution, we can't see the decay because the track is too short. So to observe at least 30% of the decays, the detector's resolution should be such that the decay occurs within a certain distance a significant fraction of the time.

So first, I should compute the average decay length, which is c multiplied by the lifetime, but adjusted for the particle's speed.

Wait, but the particle is moving at relativistic speeds. So I need to calculate the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Because E = gamma * m c², so gamma = E / (m c²). But wait, E is given in GeV, and the mass is also in GeV/c². Oh right, because E = gamma m c², so
