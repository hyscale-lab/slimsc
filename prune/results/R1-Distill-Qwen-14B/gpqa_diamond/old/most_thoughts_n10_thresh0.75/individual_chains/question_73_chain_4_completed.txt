Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to figure out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember some stuff from my classes, but let me think through it carefully.

The problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy.

First, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)). Wait, or is it (v1 + v2) when they're moving in opposite directions? No, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so it's v1 - v2.

So for the relative speed, let me plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Let me calculate the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator would be 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let me compute that denominator part: 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, and c squared over c squared is 1, so 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed v_rel is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. Oh, looking at the options, I think option C and D have 0.14c. So about 0.14c.

Now, for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = Gamma1 * m1c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, actually, the formula is E = gamma * m c². So for 2m, E1 is 2m * gamma1 c²? Let me double-check. Yes, because the rest energy is mc², so with mass 2m, it's 2mc² multiplied by gamma, so E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 3m * gamma2 c² = 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Adding them together, E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc² ≈ 5.9641 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So the total energy is about 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Wait, but let me make sure about the relative speed. I calculated v_rel as (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So options C and D have 0.14c. But D's E is 5 mc². So the correct E is about 5.96, which would be option C.

So the answer should be C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

1. **Numerator**: \(v_1 - v_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
