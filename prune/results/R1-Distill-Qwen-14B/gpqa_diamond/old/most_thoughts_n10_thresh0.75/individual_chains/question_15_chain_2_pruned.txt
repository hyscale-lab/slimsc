Alright, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me see if I can figure it out. Okay, the question is about which planet is more likely to transit, so that the researchers can observe it. They've given me some parameters about the planets and their host stars. 

Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, the RV method has already detected these planets, so they must have some orbital parameters known.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, P1 is shorter, meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star? Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. Oh right, Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So shorter period implies smaller orbit, so closer in.

Both have circular orbits, which simplifies things because eccentricity isn't a factor here. 

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So even though Star_1 is more massive, it's not larger in radius. Maybe because they're the same radius, but different masses, their densities are different. But how does that affect the transit probability?

Wait, transit probability (or the chance that the planet transits) depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star's size. Oh, no, wait. More accurately, it's the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the star's radius. Wait, no, I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But without knowing the inclination, but since they want the highest probability, perhaps we assume that the planets are in randomly oriented orbits. So the geometric probability is the ratio (R_star / a) , where a is the semi-major axis, but wait, no, I think the formula is that the probability is roughly (R_star / a), because the planet has to be close enough in line for us to see the transit. So a smaller a (closer in) means a higher probability because R_star/a is larger.

But let me think again. The probability of
