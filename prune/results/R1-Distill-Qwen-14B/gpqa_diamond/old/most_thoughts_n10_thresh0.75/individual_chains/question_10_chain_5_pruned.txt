Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a to d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Let me read the options again carefully.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this one is just our own planet, so density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density ~5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the density is given as about 5.5. So mass is 2 Earth masses. Hmm. But wait, density is mass divided by volume. So if the mass is higher, but the density is the same, then the volume must be larger. So, for example, if Earth is mass M, radius R, volume (4/3)πR³. If another planet has 2M and same density, volume would be 2*(volume of Earth). So radius would be cube root of (2)^(1/3) times Earth's radius. So that planet is bigger but same density. So the density stays the same as Earth, so maybe 5.5 as well.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Wait, same composition means same density. Because density is based on what it's made of. So if it's same composition, then density should be same as Earth, right? Wait, but the mass is 5 times. So the mass is higher, same density, so volume is 5 times Earth's. So radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. So this planet is bigger but same density as Earth. So density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Same logic here—same composition implies same density. So mass is half, so volume is half, radius would be cube root of (1/2) times Earth's radius. But density is still 5.5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about which has the highest density. So all of them except option b have the same density as Earth, 5.5. What about option b?

Wait, option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and
