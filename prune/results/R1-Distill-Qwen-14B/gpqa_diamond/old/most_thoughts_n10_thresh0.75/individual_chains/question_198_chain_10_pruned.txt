Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Let me break this down.

So, the problem states that there's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex, the one with two SCN- ligands. 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question mentions "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN- ligands. So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2]^2+, [Co(SCN)3]^3-, and [Co(SCN)4]^4-. So each β represents the formation constant for each step, right?

Stability constant β is defined as [CoL_n]/([CoL_{n-1}][L]), where L is the ligand. For each step, the formation of the next complex. So β1 is the formation of the first complex, β2 the second, etc. 

So the complexes in order are:
1. [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
2. [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} (n=2)
3. [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3)
4. [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} (n=4)

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but wait, the β values are cumulative, right? No, wait, no, each β is for each step. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn. For example, the overall K1 for [CoL]^+ is β1=9. K2 for [CoL2]^{2+} is β1*β2 = 9*40=360. Similarly, K3 is β1β2β3=9*40*63=25200. K4 is 9*40*63*16=25200*16=403200.

Wait, wait, no, that's right. Because each βn is the step-wise formation constant, so the overall constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn. So:

β_total for n=1: K1=β1=9
n=2: K2=β1β2=9*40=360
n=3: K3=β1β2β3=9*40*63=25200
n=4: K4=β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16=403200

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because each β is the step-wise constant, so the overall is the product of all β's up to that n. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the concentrations of the various Co species are determined by the ligand concentration and the stability constants. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} = c = 1e-2 M.

But wait, that's a lot of species. But given the high K values, especially for K3 and K4, perhaps the majority of Co is in the highest complex, but the question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

Wait, but with K2=360, K3=25200, K4=403200. So each step is much higher than the previous. So the majority is probably going to be in the highest complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

But wait, the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, but which one is blue? I'm not exactly sure about the colors, but the question statement says it's the blue one, so perhaps which one is it. But in any case, the question just wants the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, the dithiocyanato complex.

So, to find the percentage, I need to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} relative to all cobalt species.

The general approach is to write the expressions for each species in terms of [Co^2+] and the ligand concentration.

But since the ligand concentration is much higher than the metal concentration, and the formation constants are large, the solution is dominated by the most stable complex, which is the one with four ligands. But wait, let me think: when [SCN-] is high and the stability constants are high, the metal tends to form the most stable complex possible.

Wait, the [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M. The total Co is 1e-2 M, which is lower. So, if the ligand is in excess, the metal will form the most stable complex. So, the most stable is the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex, which has the highest K4.

But wait, let's think about the formation: each step's constant is βn. So, the dominant species would be the one where the product of the formation constant and the ligand concentration is the highest.

Wait, but the approach to calculate the concentrations is a bit involved. I think I can model each complex's concentration as a function of the free Co^2+ concentration.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of x and the ligand concentration.

So, for each complex:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN]^1
[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = β1β2 * x * [SCN]^2
[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β1β2β3 * x * [SCN]^3
[Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} = β1β2β3β4 * x * [SCN]^4

Wait, or is it [SCN]^n for each complex? Because each complex has n SCN- ligands. So yes.

But wait, another approach is to consider that the formation of each subsequent complex depends on the [SCN-] and the previous complex.

Alternatively, since the [SCN-] is high, and the stability constants are large, the concentrations of each complex can be approximated in terms of the highest possible complex. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the approximation that the majority of the Co is in the highest complex, but since the question asks specifically for the dithiocyanato complex, perhaps we need to calculate all concentrations.

Another approach is to consider that the concentration of each complex is proportional to (β1β2...βn) * [SCN]^n.

So, each species' concentration is proportional to (β1β2...βn) * [SCN]^n. Then, the sum of all these terms is equal to the total Co concentration, c.

So, let's denote the total as sum_{n=0}^4 (β1β2...βn) [SCN]^n} = c. Wait, but n=0 is [Co^2+], which is x.

Wait, no, n=0 would be [Co^2+] = x, then n=1 is [CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN]^1, n=2 is β1β2 x [SCN]^2, etc.

Wait, but wait, n=0 is [Co^2+] = x, which isn't multiplied by any β. So the sum is x + β1 x [SCN] + β1β2 x [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 x [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 x [SCN]^4 = c.

But [SCN] is 0.1 M. Let me plug that in.

So, x [1 + β1 * 0.1 + β1β2 (0.1)^2 + β1β2β3 (0.1)^3 + β1β2β3β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2.

But wait, β1 is 9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, let's compute each term inside the brackets.

Term 0: 1

Term1: β1 *0.1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2: β1β2 (0.1)^2 = 9*40*(0.01) = 360 * 0.01= 3.6

Term3: β1β2β3 (0.1)^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.001) = (9*40=360, 360*63=22680) 22680 * 0.001=22.68

Term4: β1β2β3β4 (0.1)^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.0001) = Let's compute that step by step.

First, 9*40=360. 360*63=22680. 22680 *16=362880. 362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Wait, so the terms are:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

+3.6 → 5.5

+22.68 → 28.18 

+36.288 → 64.468

So the sum is approximately 64.468.

So, x * 64.468 = 1e-2 → x = 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co^2+] = x ≈ 1.55e-4 M

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN] = 9 * 1.55e-4 * 0.1 → 9 * 1.55e-5 = 1.395e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = β1β2 x (SCN)^2 = 9*40 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2 → 360 * 1.55e-4 * 0.01 → 360 * 1.55e-6 → approx 5.58e-4 M

Wait, let's compute that:

9*40=360. So 360 * x * (0.1)^2.

x is 1.55e-4, (0.1)^2 is 0.01.

So 360 * 1.55e-4 * 0.01 = 360 * 1.55e-6 → 360 * 1.55e-6 = (360 * 1.55) * 1e-6.

360 *1.55 → 360 *
