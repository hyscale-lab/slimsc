Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about electric fields around conductors. I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the conductor is like a bigger sphere, and the cavity is off-center inside it.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I need to figure out which of the four options correctly gives the magnitude of the electric field at point P.

Wait, so the conductor is initially uncharged. When you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, how does that affect the charges? I remember that the conductor being a conductor means that charges can move freely. So when the charge +q is placed in the cavity, the free electrons in the conductor will be attracted to it. But since the conductor was initially neutral, the induced charges would be such that the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) has an induced charge equal and opposite to +q. So the inner surface would have -q. But then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Or wait, is that right?

Wait, wait. No. The conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. When +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface (the cavity's walls) must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Because, in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have -q. But since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner is -q, so the outer is +q to make the conductor's total charge zero.

So the outer surface has a charge of +q. But wait, the conductor is a sphere, with a cavity. If the charge is placed off-center, does that affect the distribution on the conductor's surfaces?

Hmm. I think that the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces will be such that the inner surface has a charge of -q, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity. Because the field inside the conductor (the material) must be zero, so the inner surface must exactly cancel the field due to the +q charge. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but if the charge is placed off-center, like in a cavity whose center is shifted by s, would that cause the outer surface's charge to be distributed non-uniformly? Or is the outer surface's charge still uniform because the conductor is spherical?

I think the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because a spherical conductor in electrostatic equilibrium has charges on the outer surface that are uniformly distributed, regardless of the inner charge placement. Because the outer surface is a sphere, symmetry says the outer charge distribution depends only on the net charge, not on the inner arrangement. So the outer surface has +q uniformly distributed.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor is uncharged, total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and because the outer surface is a sphere, the distribution is uniform. So from the outside, the field would be as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center.

Wait, so when you have a spherical shell with charge +q on it, the electric field outside depends only on that charge, right? So the field outside the conductor (which is a spherical shell) would be as if the charge is at the center.

So in this case, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field at P would be the same as if the charge +q was at the center of the conductor. But wait, the charge was placed inside the cavity, which is off-center. But the outer charge distribution is uniform, so from the outside, it's as if the charge is at the center. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the options have different expressions. Let me check the options again.

Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Which is what I just thought.

But wait, why are the other options there? Let me think again.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and at a distance l from the center of the cavity. There's an angle theta between l and s, where s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, so the system is a conductor of radius R, and a cavity of radius r, whose center is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the centers are not the same.

So the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is located at a point s away from the center of the conductor. So from the center of the conductor, the charge is at a point s away. So the position of the charge relative to the conductor's center is not at the center.

But the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q on it, uniformly distributed. So the field outside the conductor (i.e., at P, which is outside) is determined by the +q charge of the outer surface.

But since the outer surface is a shell, the field outside due to a uniformly charged shell is as if the charge were at the center. So the electric field at P is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Thus, the direction depends on the position relative to the conductor's center.

But wait, point P is a point outside the conductor. The distance from the conductor's center is L, so the electric field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L² in the direction away from the center.

But wait, the charge in the cavity is at a point s away from the conductor's center. Does this affect the field outside?

Wait, no. Because the outer surface's charge is what produces the external field. The inner charge affects the inner surface, but the outer surface's charge is uniform. So from the outside, the field is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

So for point P, which is at a distance L from the conductor's center, E would be as if the charge is at the center, regardless of where the charge was placed inside the cavity.

So the correct expression is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but wait, what about the other options? Let me make sure.

Option A: 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l - s cosθ)^2. That's like the field from a point charge located at the center of the cavity, perhaps. But the field outside the conductor is due to the outer charge, which is at the center of the conductor, not the cavity.

Option C: 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l + s cosθ)^2. Hmm, not sure, but probably incorrect.

Option D: 1/(4πε₀) * q / l². That would be the case if the charge was considered to be at the center of the cavity, but in reality, the outer field is based on the conductor's center.

So I think B is the correct answer.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The outer surface's charge distribution is uniform due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

The electric field outside a spherical shell of charge depends only on the total charge on the shell and the distance from its center. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is as if the charge $+q$ were located at the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the conductor is $L$, so the magnitude of the electric field is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: This expression suggests the field is due to a charge at the cavity's center, which is not the case for the external field.
- **Option C**: This expression is also inconsistent with the external field, as it appears to involve a modified distance based on $l$ and $s$.
- **Option D**: This expression assumes the field depends on $l$, the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center, which is not relevant for the external field.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
