Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, it's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Wait, I remember that the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is a common problem in quantum mechanics. 

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think step by step.

First, I need to recall how the energy levels work for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think each energy level is determined by the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. For a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or wait, maybe it's E = (n + 3/2)ħω where n is the total quantum number, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Yeah, that sounds right. Because each direction contributes a term (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

So the energy levels are quantized with each level characterized by a non-negative integer n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers. The ground state is when n=0, which would correspond to (0,0,0). The first excited state is n=1, which can have different configurations like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Then the second excited state would be n=2, like (2,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,2,0), (0,1,1), (0,0,2). Wait, no, n is the sum. So the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third excited is n=3. Oh wait, because the third excited state is the one after the first two. So n=0 is ground, n=1 is first excited, n=2 is second, n=3 is third.

So the third excited state has n=3. So the energy E is (3 + 3/2) ħω? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) so sum is (n_x +n_y +n_z + 3/2) ħω. So n = n_x +n_y +n_z. So yes, E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

So for n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the energy part. Looking at the options, A and C have (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy eigenvalue. So, this is the degeneracy. The degeneracy is the number of possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplets that sum to n=3.

To find the number of such triplets, I can think of it as the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. This is a combinatorics problem, stars and bars. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (3 +2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy can also be calculated using the quantum numbers. For n = 3, the possible states are all the combinations where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers adding up to 3. So for each possible permutation, they contribute different states unless some quantum numbers are the same.

So the number of states is (n+1)(n+2)/2, but wait, no. Wait, for n=0, only 1 state. n=1: 3 states. n=2: 6 states. n=3: 10 states. Wait, yeah, that's the pattern. Because 1,3,6,10 is the triangular numbers, which corresponds to (n+2 choose 2). For n=3, (3+2) choose 2 is 10. So that's the degeneracy.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking back at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω and 10. Option C is (9/2) ħω and 3. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are the options correct? Let me look again. The options are:

A) (9/2) ħω , 10
B) 11 π² ħ²/(2m r²), 10
C) (9/2) ħω, 3
D) 11 π² ħ²/(2m r²), 3

So yes, A is the correct option for both the energy and the number of eigenfunctions.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle with mass $m$ moving in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are determined by the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number. The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second excited state to $n = 2$, and the third excited state to $n = 3$. For $n = 3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) corresponding to a given energy eigenvalue is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and the degeneracy is 10. Among the given options, only option A matches these results.

Answer: A
