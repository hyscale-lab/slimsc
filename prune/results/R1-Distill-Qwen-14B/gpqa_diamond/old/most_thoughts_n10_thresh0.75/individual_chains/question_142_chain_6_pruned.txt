Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Let me think. The |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the standard basis states for a qubit. So when you take |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, those are projectors onto the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively. Adding them together and then scaling by 1/2—so each term has a coefficient of 1/2.

I think this is a maximally mixed state because it has equal probabilities for both states. Oh right, for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is (I)/2, where I is the identity matrix, because the trace has to be 1. Let me check that. The identity matrix for a 2x2 system would be [[1,0],[0,1]], so dividing by 2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], which is exactly what this ρ is. So ρ is the maximally mixed state.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how the density matrices are represented geometrically. I remember that the space of qubit density matrices is a subset of 3-dimensional space, often visualized using the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? So how does this apply to mixed states?

Oh wait, the density matrix can be parameterized using the Bloch vector. For a general 2x2 density matrix, it can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. The length of r determines how mixed or pure the state is. If r is zero, it's the completely mixed state (maximally mixed). If r has length 1, it's a pure state on the Bloch sphere.

So in our case, since ρ is (I)/2, that would mean r is zero because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C says r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, let me make sure. Another way to think about it: the density matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. The standard form for the density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is [[ (1 + a_z)/2, (a_x - i a_y)/2 ], [ (a_x + i a_y)/2, (1 - a_z)/2 ]]. If the state is diagonal, that implies a_x and a_y are zero. So
