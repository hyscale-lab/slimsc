Okay, so I've got this physics problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state. The Boltzmann factor is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT), right?

The system has three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). J is probably a coupling constant, maybe like a measure of interaction strength between spins. I'm not sure if J is positive or negative, but I think it doesn't matter because the energy will depend on the product of the spins.

First, I need to figure out all possible states and their corresponding energies. Let's see, each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll list them all:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E. Let's calculate that for each case.

The energy formula is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 for each state.

1. All spins +1:
S1S2=+1*+1=+1
S1S3=+1*+1=+1
S2S3=+1*+1=+1
Sum = 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.
Sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.
Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1.
Sum = -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1.
Sum = -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.
Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.
Sum = +1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

8. All spins -1:
S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1.
Sum =3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, let me double-check those calculations. For state 8, each product is (+1), so sum is 3. So energy is -3J, correct.

Now, let's count how many states have each energy.

Looking at all 8 states:

- Energy = -3J occurs in states 1 and 8. So two states.

- Energy = J occurs in states 2,3,4,5,6,7. That's six states.

So each state with energy -3J contributes e^(β*3J) because E = -3J, so -βE = 3βJ.

Each state with energy J contributes e^(-β J) because E = J, so -βE = -βJ.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states:

Z = (number of states with E=-3J) * e^(3Jβ) + (number of states with E=J) * e^(-Jβ)

Which is Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ) → No, because our exponents are positive. 

Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ). Yes, that's exactly what I got.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)
B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)
C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)
D) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)

So option B matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck:

Each state's energy:

State 1: E=-3J → contribution e^(3Jβ). 2 such states → 2 e^(3Jβ).

States 2-7: each E= J → e^(-Jβ). 6 states → 6 e^(-Jβ).

So Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which is option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by considering the energy of the system given by:

\[
E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3).
\]

There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states, and the energy for each state is calculated based on the products \( S_1S_2 \), \( S_1S_3 \), and \( S_2S_3 \). The energy can take two values: \( -3J \) and \( J \), depending on the number of \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) spin configurations.

### Step 1: Classify states by energy
- **Energy \( -3J \):** This occurs when all three spins are aligned (either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)). There are 2 such states.
- **Energy \( J \):** This occurs when two spins are aligned and one is opposite. There are 6 such states.

### Step 2: Partition function formula
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Substituting the energy values:
- For states with \( E = -3J \), the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta(-3J)} = e^{3J\beta} \). Since there are 2 such states, their contribution is \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).
- For states with \( E = J \), the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta(J)} = e^{-J\beta} \). Since there are 6 such states, their contribution is \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

### Step 3: Combine contributions
The partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the exponents are reversed).
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived result).
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the exponents are wrong).
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are wrong).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
