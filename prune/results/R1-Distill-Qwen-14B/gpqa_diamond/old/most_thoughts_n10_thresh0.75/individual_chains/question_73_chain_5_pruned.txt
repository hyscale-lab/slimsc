Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use special relativity equations. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The problem says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the relative speed isn't just the difference in their speeds because that's what you do in classical mechanics. But at relativistic speeds, you can't do that. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So, the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c, and the second is moving at v = 0.5c. But wait, actually, I think I got that backwards. Wait, the first astronaut is 2m moving at 0.6c, and the second is 3m moving at 0.5c. So, if I'm the first astronaut, I see the second moving at what speed?

The velocity addition formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The formula is for when you have two frames, S and S'. If S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u of an object in S is u' in S' as (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

Wait, in this case, astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c in the positive x direction, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction. So, from A's perspective, what is B's speed? Wait, no, wait. Actually, if we're considering the relative speed, perhaps it's better to think of it as the speed of B relative to A.

So, to find the relative speed of B with respect to A, we consider A as the rest frame. So, the formula would be (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The
