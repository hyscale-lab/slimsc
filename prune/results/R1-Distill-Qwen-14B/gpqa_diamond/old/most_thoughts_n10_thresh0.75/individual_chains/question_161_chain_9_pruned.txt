Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscope question. Let me read through it again.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope that's operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible because they can interfere with the electron microscopy by scattering the electrons.

But even after doing that, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules in that vacuum state. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. He found this to be λ1, which depends on factors like the sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, something interesting happens. The mean free path changes; it's now λ2 instead of λ1. The temperature in the sample compartment is the same, so that's not changing. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1.

Hmm. So I need to think about what affects the mean free path. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(nπd²), where n is the number density of the gas molecules, and d is the effective diameter of the molecules. Alternatively, λ is also proportional to 1/(P/kT), where P is pressure and T is temperature, since n is proportional to P/(kT) from the ideal gas law.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about mean free path: in a vacuum, the mean free path is longer because there are fewer molecules to collide with. So when the electron beam is on, does that affect the gas molecules in some way?

The initial mean free path λ1 is determined under the ultra-high vacuum conditions. When the electron beam is on, what changes? Well, high-energy electrons can cause various effects. One possibility is that the electrons can interact with the gas molecules, perhaps ionizing them or causing them to move more. Another possibility is that the electrons cause gas molecules to scatter more, which would change the mean free path.

Wait, but wait a second. The mean free path is primarily determined by the density of the gas, right? Because λ = 1/(nσ), where σ is the collision cross-section. So if the number density n decreases, the mean free path increases. Alternatively, if n increases, λ decreases.

But in this scenario, the pressure hasn't changed because the pumps are presumably still running, or the pressure was already at 1e-9 Torr. So why would λ change?

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam somehow affects the gas. Maybe it heats the gas molecules, causing their velocities to increase. That would affect the mean free path. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to ionize, which could change their effective cross-section.

Wait, but the temperature is the same. The question says the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So thermal expansion or velocity changes due to temperature are the same as before. So the main variables are the pressure (which is same) and the nature of the gas.

But wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at a high speed. The gas molecules are in the vacuum chamber
