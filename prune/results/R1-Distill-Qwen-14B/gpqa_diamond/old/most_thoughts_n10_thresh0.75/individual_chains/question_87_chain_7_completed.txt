Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, a di-substituted benzene would have 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. Oh, right, because di-substituted means two substituent groups attached to the ring. So, the ring has 6 carbons, and each substituent contributes 1 carbon each, making 8 total. Hmm, but wait, substituents could be more complex. Let me think.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound must have both a carbonyl group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, so substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen? Or maybe the substituents could be something else with a carbonyl or halogen elsewhere. Let's think: the aromatic ring is benzene, which has six carbons. Each substituent is attached to the ring. So if the compound has 8 carbons in total, the substituents must add two carbons. So, each substituent is one carbon. So, a carbonyl group is probably a ketone or maybe an aldehyde, but wait, a carbonyl group is O=C-, so that's part of a substituent.

Wait, substituents could be like -CO-X or something else. Hmm, no, wait. Let me think: if the substituents are each one carbon, like -X and -CO-R, but wait, that would add more carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -OAc (acetate) and -X. No, wait, acetate is OAc, which is three carbons (the methyl group). Hmm, but that would make the substituents add more than two carbons. So, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. So, substituents are -CO- something and -X.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, and a halogen. Let's think: for a benzene ring, substituents. So, for di-substituted, positions matter. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, but the problem says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, the ring is benzene, with two substituents. The substituents must account for the additional two carbons. So, each substituent is one carbon. So, one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, but wait, a ketone substituent would be a carbonyl group attached to something else. Hmm, maybe a substituent like -CO- where the other part is attached elsewhere?

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. But a halogen substituent is just -X, which doesn't add any carbons. So, that wouldn't account for the two carbons. Hmm. Wait a minute, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen, but maybe one of them is a methyl group with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's take a different approach.

The compound has an aromatic ring (6 carbons), two substituents that account for 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon. One substituent has a carbonyl group, and the other has a halogen.

Wait, but a substituent with a carbonyl group would be like a ketone, but that's generally a R-CO- group. If it's attached to the ring, it's an aryl ketone. So, the substituent would be -CO-R, but R would have to be something. But in this case, substituents are only one carbon each. So perhaps the substituents are -CO- and -X.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. A carbonyl group needs to be attached to something. Maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like as part of an ester or something. Hmm.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone, but that would require another carbon attached. Wait, but if the substituent is -CO-, that's a carbonyl group attached directly to the ring. But that would be a ketone, so the structure would be benzene with a carbonyl group as a substituent. But that would be a ring with a carbonyl, like benzaldehyde if it's an aldehyde. Wait, no, benzaldehyde is a mono-substituted benzene. But in this case, it's di-substituted, so another substituent is present.

Wait, the substituents must be a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde or ketone) and a halogen. But each substituent is one carbon, so the carbonyl substituent would have to be like a -CHO group (aldehyde) or a -CO-R where R is another substituent? But if R is another substituent, that would add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps one of the substituents is a methyl ketone group. For example, the substituent is -COCH3, which is a ketone. That would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3), but that would make the substituent two carbons, and the ring is 6, so total 8? Let's see: 6 (benzene) + 2 substituents (COCH3 and X). Wait, COCH3 has two carbons, so substituents' carbons would be 2 (from COCH3) and 0 (X), but then the total would be 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. Oh, that makes sense.

So, the substituents are -COCH3 and -X. So, the compound is a di-substituted benzene with substituents at the para position (since the NMR might show two doublets), but let me think about that.

So, the structure would be something like para-bromo acetophenone, for example. So, the two substituents are at the para positions on the benzene ring: one is a bromine (or other halogen, like Cl, Br, I), and the other is an acetyl group (COCH3).

Now, let's think about the NMR spectrum.

In the 1H NMR, what signals would we expect?

The aromatic protons: in a para-substituted benzene, the para substituents cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the substituents would be deshielded and downfield shifted, and the meta protons might be another set. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the splitting can be more complex.

Wait, if the ring is para-substituted with two different groups, the aromatic protons can be split into more signals. Let me think: if the substituents are in the para positions (positions 1 and 3, if the ring is numbered such), then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,4,5,6. Because positions 1 and 3 are substituents.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents in positions 1 and 4 (para). Then, the ring has substituents in 1 and 4. So, the H's are in positions 2,3,5,6. These would form two sets of equivalent protons. Protons in positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. But because substituents are different (one is X, the other is COCH3), the equivalence may be broken.

Wait, but if the substituents are para, the ring is symmetric. So, if substituents are different, the protons might still split into two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two different groups, the aromatic protons are split into two sets. Each set would have two protons as doublets.

Wait, so for example, in para-dichlorobenzene, all the aromatic protons are equivalent, and they show up as a singlet. But when the substituents are different, the symmetry is broken, leading to two sets of protons: the ones ortho to the substituents, and the ones meta.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the substituents are at para positions, so the protons next to the substituents (ortho) would be in one environment, and the protons across (meta) in another. So, in the NMR, we might see two doublets. But let me think about the coupling.

In a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, each substituent has ortho and para positions. Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets.

Alternatively, let me think about specific examples. Take para-bromo acetophenone: the structure is benzene with a Br at position 1 and a COCH3 at position 4.

So, the aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6.

Protons 2 and 6 are ortho to COCH3 and meta to Br.

Protons 3 and 5 are ortho to Br and meta to COCH3.

Wait, but the question is about the NMR signals. Each of these protons would be split into certain patterns.

But perhaps in this case, each substituent's effect is such that the ortho protons to the substituent are deshielded, and so their chemical shifts are downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps in the NMR, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. For example, two doublets of 2H each. So, looking at the options, let's check.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So, the aromatic region has two doublets and a singlet, which seems a bit off for a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents. The singlet at 9.9 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, the substituent is COCH3, which is a ketone, so there's no aldehyde proton. So, maybe that's not the case.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So, the aromatic region has two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The singlet at 2.3 ppm would be a CH3 group attached to something, perhaps the carbonyl. So, this could correspond to the COCH3 group. So, the aromatic protons are each two doublets (each 2H), and a singlet for the CH3.

That fits with the substituents being COCH3 and X (like Br) in para positions.

Wait, but what about the coupling? Let me think about the splitting. Each of the two doublets would be a result of coupling with one neighboring proton. So, each aromatic proton is split into a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton.

But in a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to substituents would be coupled with each other. So, for example, proton 2 is next to 3, which is next to substituent X. Hmm, perhaps each set of two protons would show as a doublet, with each proton coupled to one adjacent.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another structure. Suppose the substituents are a carbonyl group (COCH3) and a halogen (Br) in para positions. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons 2 and 6 are ortho to COCH3. The protons 3 and 5 are ortho to Br.

So, each of these protons would have different chemical shifts. So, for each substituent, the ortho protons would be deshielded.

In the NMR, the protons ortho to the COCH3 (positions 2 and 6) would be one set, and the protons ortho to Br (positions 3 and 5) would be another. Each set would have two protons and would be a doublet, because each proton is next to one proton of the same set.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, adjacent protons are coupled. So, in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, each set of protons (ortho to substituent A and ortho to substituent B) would be a doublet.

So, in the NMR, we would have two doublets in the aromatic region: one for the protons ortho to substituent A (like COCH3) and another for the protons ortho to substituent B (like Br). Each doublet would integrate to 2H.

Looking at the options, option C shows 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d). That fits this scenario. The 2.3 ppm singlet would be the CH3 from COCH3.

So, that would make option C a likely candidate.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option A has a singlet in the aromatic region, which doesn't fit the scenario where there are two doublets. Also, the singlet at 9.9 ppm might indicate an aldehyde proton, which we don't have because the substituent is a ketone (COCH3).

Option B's aromatic signals are at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are upfield, more indicative of protons adjacent to oxygen, like in an ether or something, but not in an aromatic ring. So probably not the correct option.

Option D has a singlet in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm, 1H), which again doesn't fit with a para-substituted benzene that should have two sets of doublets. The other peaks are more indicative of perhaps an allylic or some other structure, but not aromatic.

So, the correct option is C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The aromatic ring has six carbons, and the two substituents account for the remaining two carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃) and a halogen (-X). The substituents are likely in the para positions on the benzene ring, as this arrangement is common for di-substituted aromatic compounds.

In the ¹H NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons ortho to the carbonyl group (-COCH₃) and the halogen (-X) will experience different electronic environments, leading to distinct chemical shifts. The protons ortho to the carbonyl group will be more deshielded and appear downfield as a doublet, while the protons ortho to the halogen will also appear as a doublet but at a slightly upfield shift. Additionally, the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (CH₃ in -COCH₃) will appear as a singlet due to its symmetry.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. However, the compound contains a ketone (-COCH₃) rather than an aldehyde, making this option incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm, which are indicative of protons near oxygen atoms (e.g., in ethers or alcohols). These signals do not align with the expected aromatic protons or the methyl group of the carbonyl substituent, making this option incorrect.
- **Option C**: Displays two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm. The doublets correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to the carbonyl and halogen substituents, while the singlet at 2.3 ppm matches the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent. This option is consistent with the expected structure.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which does not match the expected splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene. Additionally, the other signals (4.8 ppm, 4.6 ppm, and 1.3 ppm) are more characteristic of non-aromatic protons, making this option incorrect.

The correct ¹H NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Answer: C
