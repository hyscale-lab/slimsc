Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might need to think carefully.

The question is about identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues given are from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700 cm⁻¹ and an O-H stretch from the ester's R-O- part, but wait, no, esters don't have O-H stretches because they're not acidic like carboxylic acids. Oh wait, no, in esters, the oxygen is in the R-O-CO-O-R structure, so the O-H would only be present if there's a hydroxyl group somewhere else. But the FTIR says ester, so that means there's an ester functional group present, so O is there.

Now the 1H NMR data. There are six signals. Let's break them down:

- Two aromatic-H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the possible substitution patterns are either para or ortho, or meta. Wait, but the number of signals might depend on the substitution. For example, para substitution would give two sets of aromatic protons: two protons each, but maybe as a doublet or something. Or maybe more. Wait, but the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. So if it's para-substituted, the ring would have two equivalent sets of protons. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's ortho, the splitting might be more complex. Let me think. Wait, in para substitution, the ring has two equivalent protons in each set, so maybe one signal. Wait no, para substitution on a benzene ring leads to two equivalent protons in each adjacent position. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the number of signals. If it's di-substituted and the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: each pair being equivalent. So the NMR would show two signals for aromatic protons. That matches the given data.

- Then there are two vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons
