Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember the Hamiltonian is an operator that represents the total energy of a system. Its eigenvalues correspond to the possible energy levels the system can have.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, σ has components σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, which are the Pauli matrices. And n is an arbitrary unit vector, meaning it's a direction in space. ε is a constant with energy dimensions.

So I need to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for Pauli matrices, when you have a vector multiplied by them and then take the dot product with another vector, it's similar to representing a spin in a certain direction.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. So H is a 2x2 matrix because it's a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

But maybe there's a shortcut here. I remember that the eigenvalues of a spin operator in any direction are ±ħ/2. Oh wait, but wait—the spin operator is usually (σ · n) multiplied by ħ/2. Let me think.

The general form for the spin operator in direction n is S = (ħ/2) σ · n. So the eigenvalues of S are ±ħ/2. So if the Hamiltonian is proportional to σ · n, then its eigenvalues would be proportional to that.

In this problem, H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalues of H would be ± ε times some factor. Let me recall the spin operator. Since S = (ħ/2) σ · n, the eigenvalues of σ · n must be ± something. Because S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, then (σ ·n) must have eigenvalues ±1. Because S = (ħ/2) σ · n → eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2) * (eigenvalues of σ ·n).

Wait, let me clarify. The operator σ ·n is a matrix, and its eigenvalues are ±1. Because for any unit vector n, the matrix σ ·n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. How do I know that? Well, because σ ·n is a Hermitian matrix (Pauli matrices are Hermitian when multiplied by real coefficients, so the dot product with a real unit vector will be Hermitian). The trace is 0 (since each Pauli matrix has trace 0), so eigenvalues must be +1 and -1, adding to zero.

So the eigenvalues of σ ·n are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H = ε (σ ·n) would be ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), which are ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B says +ε and -ε. Option C is with ħ/2 factors, which might come into play if the Hamiltonian had a term like ħ multiplied in, but in this case, the Hamiltonian is directly ε times σ ·n.

Wait another thought—does the Pauli matrix already include factors of ħ? Because sometimes in physics, the spin operator is written as S = (ħ/2)σ. So if the Hamiltonian is expressed as H = ε σ ·n, does that include the ħ/2 factor or not? Because if the Hamiltonian is written without that factor, then the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

In the problem, H is given as ε σ ·n. So in that case, the eigenvalues are ±ε. So the correct answer should be option B.

Let me think again. Let's compute it explicitly. The matrix σ ·n can be written as n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Each σ_i is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of such a matrix (when n is a unit vector) are indeed ±1. Because, for any such matrix, its square is the identity matrix. Let me see: (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding that, each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), and the cross terms (σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i) for i≠j. But wait, [σ_i, σ_j] = 2i ε_{ijk} σ_k, so anticommutator {σ_i, σ_j} = 2 δ_ij I. So when you square σ ·n, you get (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + terms that are the sum of cross terms. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. The cross terms would involve 2(n_i n_j) {σ_i, σ_j} = 2(n_i n_j)(2 δ_ij) )=4 n_i n_j δ_ij. Wait, but δ_ij is zero when i≠j. So the cross terms vanish, and we have (σ ·n)^2 = I. So the eigenvalues must satisfy λ^2 = 1, so λ=±1.

Thus, the eigenvalues of σ ·n are ±1. Therefore, H = ε (σ ·n) has eigenvalues ±ε. So the correct answer is option B.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with energy dimensions. The task is to determine the eigenvalues of \( H \).

The Pauli spin matrices \( \vec{\sigma} \) are Hermitian, and the dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is also Hermitian. For any unit vector \( \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \). This can be shown by noting that \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{n} I = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) must satisfy \( \lambda^2 = 1 \), giving \( \lambda = \pm 1 \).

Since \( H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}) \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), not \( \pm \hbar/2 \).
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \) and is unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
