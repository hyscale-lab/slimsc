Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a Bubble Chamber at CERN. Hmm, I remember that particle physics deals with lifetimes, velocities, and how far particles travel before decaying. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime (tau_0) is 8e-16 seconds. They want to find the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when we observe it, we have to consider time dilation because the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the observed lifetime tau is gamma times tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Oh, right, because E = gamma * m c², so gamma = E / (m c²). But since both E and m are given in GeV, and c is 1 in these units (because they're using natural units where c=1), gamma would just be E/m.

So E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by approximately 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 7.9 is roughly 27 (since 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, so 7.9 is around 26.9). Hmm, so gamma is approximately 7.92.

So tau, the observed lifetime, is gamma * tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So tau = 7.92 * 8e-16. Let me compute that: 7.92 * 8 is 63.36, so tau is 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh, right, the resolution refers to the detection system's ability to distinguish events. So I think this relates to the number of decays that occur within the chamber before the particle travels too far and the decay isn't registered.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying, such that the detector can capture it. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The number of particles that decay in the chamber depends on the length they travel before decaying. The decay length is c * tau * beta, wait, no, wait. The proper lifetime is tau_0, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0. So the mean lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the particle is moving at velocity v. So the distance it travels before decaying on average is v * tau. Or, alternatively, (beta c) * gamma tau_0.

Wait, I think the formula for mean decay length is L = gamma * v * tau_0 * c. No, wait, let me think in terms of units. Tau_0 is in seconds, gamma is unitless, and velocity v is a fraction of c. So L is gamma * v * c * tau_0. Alternatively, beta is v/c, so L = beta * c * gamma tau_0.

But wait, another approach: the decay probability depends on the length of the path the particle travels. The probability that the particle decays within a certain length L is 1 - exp(-L/(c tau)). But in our case, they want at least 30% of the decays to be observed. So 30% probability of decay within length L.

Wait, so the condition is that the decay length L must be such that the probability of decay within L is at least 30%. The probability is P = 1 - exp(-L/(c tau)).

Wait, yes. So we need to solve for L in P >= 0.3.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around— the minimum L where at least 30% of the particles decay within that length. Hmm.

But let me get back to the given information. The energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV. So the gamma factor is 27 / 3.41 ≈7.918. So gamma is approximately 7.918.

Tau (the observed lifetime) is gamma *
