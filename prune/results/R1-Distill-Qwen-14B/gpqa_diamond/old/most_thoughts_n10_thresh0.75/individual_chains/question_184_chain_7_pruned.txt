Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from benzene using a series of reactions. The compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.

Let me start by breaking down the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 2, 1, and 3 respectively. Wait, numbering benzene rings can be a bit tricky, but I think I get it. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Or wait, maybe I should sketch it out.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. Let's imagine the structure: position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3 has nitro. So the substituents are in the ortho and para positions relative to each other.

But I'm not entirely sure about the numbering. Alternatively, maybe position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. So, looking at the benzene ring, the ethoxy is attached at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are all adjacent, forming a sort of meta arrangement for the nitro and the ethoxy? Or wait, perhaps the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to both 2 and 4.

Wait, maybe I should draw this. Let's think
