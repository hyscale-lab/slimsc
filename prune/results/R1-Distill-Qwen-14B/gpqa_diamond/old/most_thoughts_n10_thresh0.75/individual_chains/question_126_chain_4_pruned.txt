Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem involves two reactions, I and II. Reaction I uses (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II uses pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 and then an acidic workup. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction produces. Let's start with Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically reducing ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone, right? The structure is hexan-3-one with a methoxy group at position 5.

Hexan-3-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, the substituent is at position 5. So the structure is more like:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3?

Wait, no. Let me think. Hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is at carbon 3. So numbering from left to right, 1, 2, 3 (carbonyl), 4, 5, 6. So at position 5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2?

Wait, perhaps better to write as:

The structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Let me draw it more accurately.

Hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one has 6 carbons, with the ketone at C3.

So, the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH2-
Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)2-CH3? So positions 1-6: 1 is CH3, 2 is CH2, 3 is C=O, 4 is CH2, 5 is CH2, 6 is CH3. So the 5-methoxy group would be on carbon 5, which is the fifth carbon.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3

Wait, no, because carbon 5 is the fifth, so after the carbonyl at C3, the chain continues. So positions 4,5,6.
