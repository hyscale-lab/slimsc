Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction patterns. Let me try to break it down. The question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, where all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field diffraction pattern. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, using the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm. I remember that when you have a regular polygon as an aperture, the diffraction pattern is similar to that of a circular aperture but with some differences. But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? So wait, maybe the problem is actually about a circular aperture's diffraction. But wait, no, because the question says N is infinitely large, so the shape becomes a circle. But wait, the options don't include the standard first minimum for a circle. Oh wait, the standard single-slit minimum for a circular aperture is at sinθ = λ/(π a), but wait, that's for the first minimum in a single slit. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Single-slit diffraction for a circular aperture (like a pinhole) has the minima given by a*sinθ = mλ, where m is the order, a is the radius. So the first minimum is at m=1, so θ = λ/(a). But wait, in the single-slit formula, the minima occur when a sinθ = mλ, for integer m. So the first minimum would be at θ = λ/(a). But wait, I'm not sure if this is the case here.

Wait, but the problem is about a polygonal aperture. But when N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle. So perhaps the diffraction pattern becomes similar to a circular aperture. But wait, for a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern has minima at angles where a sinθ = mλ, m being 1, 2, 3, etc. So the first minima would be at θ ≈ λ/(a), using the small-angle approximation (since sinθ ≈ θ for small angles).

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the setup. The problem says the apothems are all of
