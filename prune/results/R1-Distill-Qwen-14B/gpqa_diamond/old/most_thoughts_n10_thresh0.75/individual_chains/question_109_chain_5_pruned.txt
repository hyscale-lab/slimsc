Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what the question is asking.

The problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state that emit a particle X. I remember that in nuclear physics, the 1S0 state refers to the spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, S is 0 because (2*0 +1) =1. Wait, no, actually wait. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 would mean that S=0, because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The L is S, which is the orbital part, so L=0. So the total angular momentum J is 0 because S=0 and L=0. So J=0.

So the initial state is NN in 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, the system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the NN system is in the 1S0 state, and they emit X. So the final state consists of the NN plus X.

Wait, no, the problem says the system emits a particle X, so I think the initial state is the NN bound system, and after emitting X, the NN will be in a different state, right? So the initial state is the NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in a new state plus X.

So the question is about the allowed partial waves for this emission. The options give different possibilities for the final state of NN and the emitted particle X. The options are labeled A to D, each showing the transition: initial state -> final state + X.

We need to determine which partial wave is not permitted, considering Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

The problem statement says that Pauli statistics require that the isospin T(NN), angular momentum S(NN), and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, is that the right way around? Because I remember that for identical particles, the total wavefunction must be anti-symmetric under exchange. For two nucleons, which are fermions
