Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets in a system, and they’re in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so each planet's orbital period is a multiple of the first one. Let's denote the orbital period of Planet_1 as P. Then:

Planet_1: P
Planet_2: 2P
Planet_3: 2.5P
Planet_4: 3.5P
Planet_5: 5P

But wait, since they are in orbital resonance, their periods are in ratios of small integers, I think. But the given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Hmm, maybe that's the ratio between each other. So the periods are in those proportions.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets: Planet_4 and Planet_2. And all have the same albedo. So albedo is the same, which means the same reflectivity, so it won't affect the temperature ratio. 

Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * π^2 * sigma * a^2 )) )^(1/4), but more accurately, the formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming a circular orbit and no atmosphere) is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where R_star is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, or maybe it's based on the inverse square law of radiation. Let me think.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the power radiated is proportional to T^4. So the equilibrium condition is that the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy. The energy received per unit area (like at the planet's distance) is L/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity. The planet's cross-sectional area is πr², and it emits from its entire surface area, which is 4πr². So the equation would be:

Incoming = Outgoing
(L/(4πa²)) * πr² * (1 - A) = 4πr² * σ T^
