Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about coordination complexes and stability constants. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the complexes with higher β will form more readily.

The problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean the complex has two SCN- ligands. So I'm guessing it's either the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex or maybe another one, but looking at the β values, which one is which.

Wait, the stability constants are for the complexes in order. So β1 is for the first complex, which is probably Co(SCN), since β1 is the first step. So the complexes would form stepwise. Let's think in terms of stepwise formation.

The possible complexes are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^2+ (β1=9)
Co(SCN)^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^3+ (β2=40)
Co(SCN)_2^3+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^4+ (β3=63)
Co(SCN)_3^4+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^5+ (β4=16)

Wait, but wait, the charges. Co^2+ with one SCN- (which is -1 each) would give Co(SCN)_1^+ (charge 2+ + (-1) = +1). Then adding another SCN- would make Co(SCN)_2^0? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that. Oh, wait, no, each SCN- is -1. So Co^2+ plus n SCN- would have a charge of 2+ -n. So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2. Hmm, but the problem mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN, so that would be the Co(SCN)_2^0 complex. So the complex with two SCN- is Co(SCN)_2^0.

Wait, but the β values are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β is for the step of adding another SCN-.

So the overall formation of Co(SCN)_n^{2-n} would have a cumulative stability constant, but the problem gives the stepwise constants. So for the first step, β1 is the formation of Co(SCN)^(+), then β2 is the second step, and so on.

To find the distribution of all the species, I think we need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex. Since the total cobalt is in various complexes and the free ion, we can model this using the stability constants and the concentrations.

But wait, the problem says the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So we can model this as a log distribution problem, considering all possible complexes up to n=4, but we might not need all of them. The dithiocyanato is n=2, so we need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^0 in the solution.

So, the approach is to calculate the concentration of each species (Co^2+, Co(SCN)^2+, Co(SCN)_2^0, Co(SCN)_3^–, Co(SCN)_4^{2–}) and find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex.

But how? I remember that for such distributions, you can use the stepwise formation constants and the reaction quotient approach. Maybe we can use the method where we calculate the fraction of each species based on their stability.

Wait, the general approach is to consider all possible species and their contributions. The formation of each complex depends on the previous step. So the fraction of each complex is determined by the product of the beta constants up to that step, divided by (1 + sum of all possible products up to each step).

Alternatively, the fraction of each species can be calculated by considering the cumulative product of the beta constants relative to the highest possible complex. Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using a distribution equation.

Let me think about the general formula. For each species Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}, the concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = [Co] * β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [SCN^-]^n / (denominator)

Where the denominator is the sum of all possible terms for each species, each term being β1*β2*...*βk * [SCN^-]^k for k=0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, but [Co] is the total concentration, so [Co] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

So if we can write each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration, then sum them up, and solve for [Co^2+], maybe we can find the fractions.

But that might get complicated because it's a system of equations. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the free Co^2+ is negligible compared to the complexes, but given that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M and the β values are in the range of 10 to 60, maybe the complexes are dominant.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The β for the first step is 9. The second is 40, then 63, and the fourth is 16. So the third complex (n=3) has the highest β. So the distribution might be such that the majority is in the n=3 complex, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex (n=2). So perhaps the n=2 is significant.

Another approach is to model the fraction of each species. Let me consider that the species can form up to n=4, but perhaps the highest beta is for n=3, so the distribution peaks there.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominant species is the one with the highest β, but since β3 is 63, which is the highest, perhaps the majority is in the n=3 complex. But the problem is asking about the percentage of the n=2 complex.

Wait, but let's think more carefully. The formation of each complex is stepwise. So for each step, the β is the formation constant for that step.

So, for the first complex, Co(SCN), the formation constant is β1=9. For the second step, Co(SCN)_2, β2=40. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_2 from Co^2+ and 2 SCN^- is β1*β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly, Co(SCN)_3 would have β1*β2*β3 =9*40*63= 22680.

And Co(SCN)_4 would have β1*β2*β3*β4= 22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the β's are stepwise, so each step's β is for adding one more SCN-.

But the overall K for each complex would be the product of β's up to that point.

But perhaps in this problem, since the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, the higher complexes may not form as much as the lower ones, depending on the product of K and [SCN-]^n.

Wait, the formation of each complex is influenced by the product of its overall K and [SCN-]^n. So the fraction of each species can be approximated by the relative values of these products.

So, for each species, the term is (K_n) * [SCN-]^n.

So for Co^2+ (n=0), the term is 1 (since K=1, no SCN- added).

n=1: K1=9, [SCN]=0.1 => term =9*(0.1)=0.9.

n=2: K2=9*40=360, [SCN]^2=0.01. So 360*0.01=3.6.

n=3: K3=9*40*63=22680, [SCN]^3=0.001. So 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4: K4=9*40*63*16=362880, [SCN]^4=0.0001. So 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Wait, so the terms for each species are:

n=0: 1

n=1: 0.9

n=2:3.6

n=3:22.68

n=4:36.288.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Because each step's K is the stepwise, not the overall. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the distribution using the conditional formation constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of each species is proportional to the product of the beta constants up to that species, multiplied by [SCN-]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms.

So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co_total] = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / (sum over k=0 to 4 (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN]^k )) )

Wait, but βk is up to k for each term. So for the sum, each term is the product of betas up to k, multiplied by [SCN]^k.

So let's compute each term:

n=0: product is 1 (since no betas), [SCN]^0=1. So term=1.

n=1: product β1=9, [SCN]=0.1. So term=9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360. [SCN]^2=0.01. 360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680. [SCN]^3=0.001. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1*β2*β3*β4=22680*16=362880. [SCN]^4= (0.1)^4 =0.0001. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the sum of these terms is 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 +36.288.

Let me add them up:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the sum is approximately 64.468.

So the fraction of each species is (term) / sum.

So for n=2 (dithiocyanato, Co(SCN)_2), the term is3.6.

So the fraction is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05557 or about 5.557%.

Wait, but that's way lower than the options given. The options are around 17% to 42%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the terms. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but are the β's for each step correct? So each β is for adding one more SCN-.

So the overall K for Co(SCN)_2 is β1 * β2 =9*40=360.

Similarly, for Co(SCN)_3, β1*β2*β3=9*40*63= 22680.

And Co(SCN)_4 is 9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but the terms for each species are:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1

n=1: β1*(0.1) =9 *0.1=0.9

n=2: β1*β2*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

n=3: β1*β2*β3*(0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68

n=4: β1*β2*β3*β4*(0.1)^4= 362880 *0.0001=36.288

Yes, the sum is 1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is 5.557%. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each β is the overall constant for that complex. No, no, the problem states they are stability constants, which are stepwise. So each β is the stability constant for the nth complex relative to the (n-1)th.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the conditional formation constants, K', which incorporate the ionic strength. But that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, another approach: the distribution of metal complexes can be calculated using the following formula for each species:

The fraction f_n is equal to (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN^-]^k) )

So, for each term, multiply the product of the betas up to n by [SCN^-]^n.

So let me recalculate the terms correctly.

n=0: product is 1, [SCN]^0=1 → term=1.

n=1: β1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → term=9 * 0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01 =3.6.

n=3: β1*β2*β3=9*40*63= 22680, [SCN]^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880, [SCN]^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum is 1 +0.9=1.9 → +3.6=5.5 → +22.68=28.18 → +36.288=64.468.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05557 → 5.557% which is about 5.56%. But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, considering that the dithiocyanato complex is the blue one and perhaps there's a miscalculation in the term.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the percentage is the ratio of the dithiocyanato complex to the sum of all complexes, but perhaps I forgot to include the free Co^2+ in the total. Hmm, no, because the sum includes all species.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is wrong because the [SCN-] is in excess, so the assumption is that [SCN-] is approximately constant. But wait, in our calculation, we used [SCN-] as 0.1 M, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the β values. Let me recheck the given βs: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So when calculating the term for n=4, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. So the term for n=4 is 36.288, which is the highest term, so the majority of Co would be in the n=4 complex. But the question is about the n=2 complex.

Wait, but according to the fractions, n=4 is the highest, followed by n=3, then n=2, etc. So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6/64.468≈5.56%, but that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, maybe the problem is not using the stepwise β's correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. That would change everything.

Wait, that's a possibility. So if the β's are for each complex, not stepwise, then:

β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, β4 for Co(SCN)_4.

In that case, the overall K for each would be β1, β2, etc., and the term for each species would be βn * [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but that's not how stability constants are usually defined. Stability constants are typically stepwise, not overall. But maybe the problem presents them as overall, so let's try that.

If that's the case:

n=0: 1, [SCN]^0 =1 → term=1.

n=1: β1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → term=9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3=63, [SCN]^3=0.001 →63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4=16, [SCN]^4=0.0001 →16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So the sum is 1 + 0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169, or 16.9%, which matches option D)16.9%.

But wait, the problem says the β's are stability constants, which are usually stepwise. So why does this approach give an option that's present?

Hmm, perhaps the answer is D)16.9%, which is option D.

But why would the stepwise approach give a different answer than this approach? Because I think the correct approach is the stepwise, but perhaps the problem expects the overall approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in calculating the terms. In the stepwise approach, the term for each species is the product of all β's up to that point multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Wait, let me reevaluate. Let's recalculate the terms correctly.

n=0: term=1 * [SCN]^0 =1.

n=1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1*β2 * [SCN]^2=9*40 *0.01=360*0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3=9*40*63 * 0.001= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4= 9*40*63*16 *0.0001= 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum=1 +0.9=1.9 → +3.6=5.5 → +22.68=28.18 → +36.288=64.468.

So fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.56%. But none of the options are close to that.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanate (two SCN) ion, but in the complex, it's more than two. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which complex is the blue one.

Wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes", which implies the [Co(SCN)_2] species. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the total concentration includes all species, including the free Co^2+.

Wait, the calculation I did includes all species, so the sum of fractions should be 100%, and each fraction is (term)/(sum).

So in the stepwise approach, the fraction for n=2 is 3.6/64.468≈5.56%. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options: option D is 16.9%, which is what I got when I treated the β's as overall constants.

But that's conflicting with the usual understanding of stability constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the logarithm of the stability constants, but that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, but the [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the product of the stability constants and the concentrations.

Wait, perhaps the assumption I made is that [SCN] is 0.1 M and it doesn't change much when the complexes form. So [SCN] is in excess, so the free [SCN-] is approximately 0.1 M.

Wait, but that doesn't change the calculations I did earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato ion, which is the [Co(SCN)_2], relative to the total Co species.

Wait, but that's what I calculated earlier as 5.56%, which is not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the stepwise approach, the terms are (β1*β2*...*βn) * [SCN]^n, but perhaps the denominator should be [Co_total] multiplied by some term.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the distribution using the formula for each species.

The concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n.

The total [Co] is sum from n=0 to 4 [Co(SCN)_n] = [Co^2+] (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4).

So [Co^2+] = c(Co) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 ) .

Once [Co^2+] is found, each [Co(SCN)_n] can be calculated as (β1...βn) [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

But this would require solving for [Co^2+] and then computing each [Co(SCN)_n].

But perhaps given the high concentrations of [SCN-], the denominator could be large, making [Co^2+] small. Let's try this.

First, compute the denominator term:

Denominator = 1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4.

Plugging in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1 M.

So:

Term0 =1

Term1= β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

Term2=β1β2 * [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum = 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator=64.468.

Thus, [Co^2+] = (1e-2 M) / 64.468 ≈1.551e-4 M.

Now, compute [Co(SCN)_n] for each n.

n=2: β1β2=360.

[Co(SCN)_2] =360 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2.

=360 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2.

=360 *1.551e-4 *0.01.

=360 * 1.551e-6.

=5.5836e-4 ≈5.58e-4 M.

Similarly, the total [Co] is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] plus [Co^2+].

But to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2], it's [Co(SCN)_2] / [Co_total] = (5.58e-4) / (1e-2) ) = 0.0558, which is 5.58%, same as before. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, this suggests that the correct answer is about 5.56%, but the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given as the formation constants for the overall complex, not stepwise. So β1 is for Co(SCN)_1, β2 for Co(SCN)_2, etc. That would change the calculation.

In that case, the term for each n would be βn * [SCN]^n.

So:

n=0: term=1.

n=1: β1=9 → 9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:β2=40 →40 * (0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:β3=63 →63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4:β4=16 →16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum =1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

Ah, this matches option D. So perhaps the problem presents the β's as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise.

But this is conflicting with the usual convention. Stability constants are typically stepwise, but perhaps the problem is different.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. For the complexes Co(SCN), Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4, respectively.

So if each β represents the overall stability constant for that complex relative to the free ion, then the term for each n is βn [SCN]^n.

Thus, the fraction for n=2 would be (40 * (0.1)^2) / (sum of all terms).

Which as calculated gives 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, or 16.9% → option D.

But why did the stepwise approach not match any options? Because the problem seems to present the β's as stepwise, but perhaps the intended approach is to treat them as overall.

Hmm, perhaps the question uses the overall formation constants, not the stepwise ones. So I think the correct approach is to treat them as overall constants, leading to option D.

But I'm a bit confused because normally β's are stepwise. But given the options, this must be the case.

So the answer would be option D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β) and the concentration of thiocyanate ions ([SCN^-] = 0.1 M). The stability constants provided are β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16, which are interpreted as the overall stability constants for the complexes Co(SCN), Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4, respectively.

The fraction of each cobalt species is proportional to the product of the stability constant for that species and the concentration of thiocyanate ions raised to the power of the number of ligands. The total fraction is normalized by the sum of all such terms for all possible species (n = 0 to 4). The terms for each species are calculated as follows:

- **n = 0 (free Co^2+):**  
  Term = 1 (no ligands, no stability constant).  
  Contribution = 1.

- **n = 1 (Co(SCN)):**  
  Term = β1 × [SCN^-] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9.  
  Contribution = 0.9.

- **n = 2 (Co(SCN)_2):**  
  Term = β2 × [SCN^-]^2 = 40 × (0.1)^2 = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4.  
  Contribution = 0.4.

- **n = 3 (Co(SCN)_3):**  
  Term = β3 × [SCN^-]^3 = 63 × (0.1)^3 = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063.  
  Contribution = 0.063.

- **n = 4 (Co(SCN)_4):**  
  Term = β4 × [SCN^-]^4 = 16 × (0.1)^4 = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016.  
  Contribution = 0.0016.

The sum of all contributions is:  
\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]) is:  
\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Contribution of } n = 2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is:  
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

This matches option D. The interpretation of the stability constants as overall constants for each complex, rather than stepwise constants, aligns with the given options and the calculation.

Answer: D
