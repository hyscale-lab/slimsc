Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So this is about a molecule that's rotating and vibrating. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused because the molecule can change either its rotational state, vibrational state, or both. Oh, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." That should be the smallest possible energy increase. So which transition gives the least energy difference?

I think the vibrational energy levels have a larger spacing than the rotational ones. Because for a harmonic oscillator, the vibrational energy levels are equally spaced, with spacing of ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. Whereas rotational energy levels have spacing related to the rotational constant, which depends on the moment of inertia.

So if the molecule is in its fundamental state, that's the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid or non-rigid rotor). Wait, no, in the rigid rotor model, the ground state is J=0. But in the non-rigid rotor, which allows for some stretching, maybe the model is a bit different. Hmm, but perhaps for this problem, the key is that the photon needs to cause the molecule to transition from one state to the next, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should correspond to the smallest possible energy difference. So comparing the energy needed for a vibrational transition and a rotational transition.

The vibrational energy spacing for a diatomic is given by ΔE_vib = ħω. For rotational, the energy levels are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. So the spacing between consecutive J levels is ΔE_rot = E_{J+1} - E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] = (ħ²/(2I)) (2J+3). So for the lowest possible energy transition, perhaps the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1, which would be ΔE_rot (J=0 to J=1) = (ħ²/(2I))(2*0 +3) = (3ħ²)/(2I).

But wait, the vibrational energy spacing is ħω. Let's compute both and see which is smaller.

Wait, but wait, the vibrational frequency is given as ω=4e14 rad/s. Let me compute ħω first.

ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = about 4.218e-20 J.

Now the rotational energy spacing for the transition from J=0 to J=1. First, what's the moment of inertia I of the molecule?

I is the moment of inertia for a diatomic, which is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 = about 1.818 amu. Oh wait, wait, amu needs to be converted into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =
