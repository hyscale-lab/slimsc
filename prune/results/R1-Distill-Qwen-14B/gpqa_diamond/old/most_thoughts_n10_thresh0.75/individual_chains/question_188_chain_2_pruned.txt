Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about crystals and interplanar distances.

Wait, a rhombohedral crystal system has all edges equal and all angles equal too. Oh right, in this case, the angles are each 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 angstroms. So I think the interatomic distance 'a' is 10 here.

I remember that the interplanar distance d(hkl) is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk(1 - cos α)) + ... wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral has different angles, so the formula must be more complicated.

I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (which in rhombohedral are all equal, a = b = c) and angles α, β, γ, is given by:

d(hkl) = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) ) + ( ... some terms involving the angles ) ]^(-1/2) or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait
