Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

So, we have a planet (let's call it Planet A) with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure what transit and occultation events mean here. From what I remember, a transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation, I think, is when the planet passes behind the star, so we stop seeing its reflected light or something like that.

But for both events to happen, the planet must be aligned in such a way that it can transit (so it's orbit must be edge-on enough) and also that it's in a position where it can be eclipsed by the star. Hmm, maybe the key here is about the orbital periods and the configuration of their orbits.

Wait, the question says both planets share the same orbital plane. So their orbits are aligned edge-on relative to us. That's good because it allows for transits.

But the second planet must both transit and be occulted. So, for the second planet to transit, its orbital period must be such that its orbit is also edge-on, but also, since it's a different planet, maybe their orbital periods have a certain relationship.

Wait, no. The first planet's transit is given, so the orbital plane is already edge-on. The second planet shares the same orbital plane, so its orbit is also edge-on. So, in that case, it can transit when it's in the right position.

But for it to have an occultation event, I think the orbital periods must be such that when the first planet transits, the second might be near the other side, but more importantly, for the second planet to be occulted, it must pass behind the star from our perspective. But how does that relate to the orbital periods?

Wait, maybe the periods are related in terms of orbital mechanics. The problem is about when both events can happen. So, for both transit and occultation,
