Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to determine which one is correct for a high-yield synthesis.

Let me start by drawing the target molecule. So, the benzene ring has three substituents. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl group is at position 2, the ethoxy group is at position 1, and the nitro group is at position 3. Wait, actually, I should double-check the numbering. In benzene rings, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So let's see:

The substituents are tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1: ethoxy. Position 2: tert-butyl. Position 3: nitro. So the order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl next to it, and nitro across from the ethoxy? Or maybe it's a meta arrangement.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents' positions. 2-(tert-butyl) implies the substituent is at position 2. 1-ethoxy suggests the ethoxy is at position 1, which is adjacent to position 2. Then the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 as well. So the substituents are all on adjacent positions? That would make a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Wait, but that might lead to some steric strain, but the question is about the reaction sequence.

Now, how do I build this molecule? The starting material is benzene. So I need to perform a series of substitutions or other reactions to add these groups in the correct positions.

The substituents are: tert-butyl (alkyl group, probably via Friedel-Crafts alkylation), ethoxy (an ether, likely via nucleophilic substitution or perhaps via a substitution reaction), and nitro (which is a meta director, typically introduced using a nitration reaction).

But wait, the order in which these groups are introduced matters because each substituent will direct the next reaction. Nitration is typically a meta-directing group, while alkyl groups (like tert-butyl) are ortho/para directors. Ethoxy is an activating group, but also an ortho/para director.

I think the key is to determine the order in which the substituents are added to the benzene ring. Because each substituent affects where the next one will attach.

The target has three groups: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro.

Wait, but let me think: when adding substituents, the order determines the positions. So, for example, if I first add a nitro group, that's a meta director. Then adding another group would be directed based on that. Alternatively, adding an activating group first (like ethoxy) could make the ring more reactive, but if I add a deactivating group like nitro later, that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the plan is to add the nitro group in a position that allows the other substituents to be added correctly. But let me think about each substituent's directing effects:

- tert-butyl is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.
- Ethoxy is also activating (electron-donating via O), so it directs ortho and para.
- Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing.

So, the nitro group is a strong meta director. So if I have a nitro group already on the ring, any new substituents will go in the meta positions relative to it.

Wait
