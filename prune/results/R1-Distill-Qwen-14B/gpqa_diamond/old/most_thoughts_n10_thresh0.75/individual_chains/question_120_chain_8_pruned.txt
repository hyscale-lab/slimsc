Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/distance. That means as the parallax decreases, the distance increases. So more distant stars have smaller parallaxes.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, we're looking at how the number of stars (n) depends on plx. The options are 1/plx^4, 1/plx^2, etc.

I remember that the number density of stars in a uniform distribution might relate to the volume they occupy. Since stars are in all directions, but the volume increases with distance. So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr would depend on the volume of that shell. 

The volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dr. So, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to d² dr, assuming uniform density. So, n ∝ d².

But wait, plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Substituting, n ∝ (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx². So, the number of stars per unit distance in d is proportional to 1/d², implying that the number per unit plx would be 1/plx². Because as plx decreases, each unit of plx would encompass more stars because the distance is larger, and the volume shells are bigger.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of parallax: for a small change in parallax, d(plx) = delta plx. Since plx = 1/d, delta plx would relate to delta d. Let's see: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Taking differential on both sides: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dd is proportional to 1/plx². That means as plx increases (which means d decreases), the change in d per unit plx change gets smaller.

But we're looking for the number of stars in a given plx range. Let's say we have a range from plx to plx + dplx
