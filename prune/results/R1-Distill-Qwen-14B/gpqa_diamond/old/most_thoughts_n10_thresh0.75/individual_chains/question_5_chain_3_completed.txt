Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The problem says the operator is P, and it's for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, muon is like a heavier electron, but maybe that's just a detail—probably not relevant to the math here.

So, I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P along direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it means the direction is at some angle θ from the z-axis, but there's no y-component. So maybe the direction vector has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that.

But wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. The operator P itself is the vector operator, so P = Px x-hat + Py y-hat + Pz z-hat. But since we're looking in the x-z plane, the direction is along n, which has x and z components, but no y. So, I think the operator along n would be P·n, which is P_x times n_x plus P_z times n_z. Because n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so the Py term would drop out.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator is given as P, but the problem says calculate the eigenvector of P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n. So maybe it's the expectation of P in the direction n? Or perhaps the operator P_n = P·n, which would be the component of P along direction n. Oh right, the eigenvalue equation would be (P·n)|ψ> = (±ħ/2)|ψ>, and since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, we need the eigenvector corresponding to that.

So first, I should write down P·n. Since n is in the x-z plane, n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, n_y=0.

Therefore, P·n would be n_x Px + n_z Pz. Because Py is multiplied by zero.

So let me write down the matrices for Px, Py, Pz.

Given:

Px = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1, 0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix.

So the matrix is:

First, the coefficients. Let me factor out ħ/2.

The matrix inside the brackets is:

[ [ sinθ * 0 + cosθ * 1, sinθ * 1 + cosθ *0 ],
  [ sinθ * 1 + cosθ *0, sinθ *0 + cosθ*(-1) ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, the matrices are multiplied by sinθ and cosθ individually.

So, the first term is sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]], which gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]].

The second term is cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]], which gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding these together:

Top left element: cosθ + 0 = cosθ.
Top right: sinθ + 0 = sinθ.
Bottom left: sinθ + 0 = sinθ.
Bottom right: 0 + (-cosθ) = -cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

But remember, all of this is multiplied by ħ/2, so the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

So, the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ   sinθ ],
          [ sinθ  -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = λ |v>, and we're looking for eigenvalue λ = +ħ/2.

So, (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0.

So let's write the matrix (P·n - λ I).

λ is +ħ/2. So, each element is:

Top left: (ħ/2) cosθ - (ħ/2) = (ħ/2)(cosθ - 1)
Top right: (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom left: (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom right: -(ħ/2) cosθ - (ħ/2) = -(ħ/2)(cosθ +1 )

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (cosθ -1) (ħ/2), (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(cosθ +1) (ħ/2) ] ]

But to find the determinant, perhaps I can factor out ħ/2 from each element, but that might complicate things. Wait, maybe it's better to write the equation without factoring out.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write the equation as:

( (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So, moving (ħ/2) to the other side, the equation becomes:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = I |v>

So, (matrix - I)|v> = 0.

So the matrix M = [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
                  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

For the eigenvector, the determinant of M must be zero.

So, determinant of M is:

( cosθ -1 )*(-cosθ -1 ) - sinθ * sinθ = 0

Let me compute this:

Expand (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)^2 - cosθ + cosθ +1 = -(cosθ)^2 + 1.

Then subtract sin^2θ:

So determinant = [ -(cos^2θ) +1 ] - sin^2θ = (1 - cos^2θ) - sin^2θ.

Wait, 1 - cos^2θ is sin^2θ, so determinant becomes sin^2θ - sin^2θ = 0.

Wait, that's zero. Hmm, that suggests that the matrix M is singular, so there is a non-trivial solution for the eigenvector.

So the determinant is zero, as expected for an eigenvector.

So now, let's find the eigenvector by solving M |v> = 0.

So, the equations are:

( cosθ - 1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1 ) v2 = 0

So from the first equation:

( cosθ -1 ) v1 = - sinθ v2

=> v1 = [ (sinθ) / (1 - cosθ) ] v2

Wait, because (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ), so [ cosθ -1 ] = -(1 - cosθ) => (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ).

So, equation:

( cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → [ -(1 - cosθ) ] v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → - (1 - cosθ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

Rearranged:

sinθ v2 = (1 - cosθ) v1 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

Alternatively, v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express v2 in terms of v1.

Wait, let me think about trigonometric identities. The expression (1 - cosθ)/sinθ can be simplified.

I remember that (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin^2 (θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin^2 (θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2).

So, v2 = tan(θ/2) v1.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ v1, v2 ] = [ v1, tan(θ/2) v1 ].

So, the vector is proportional to [ 1, tan(θ/2) ].

To normalize this vector, let's compute the norm squared.

The norm squared is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = |v1|^2 [ 1 + tan^2(θ/2) ) ] = |v1|^2 [ sec^2(θ/2) ) ].

Because 1 + tan^2 x = sec^2 x.

So, |v1|^2 * sec^2(θ/2) ) = |v1|^2 * (1 / cos^2(θ/2) ) ).

The norm is |v1| * (1 / |cos(θ/2)| ), so to normalize the vector, set |v1| = cos(θ/2).

So, v1 = cos(θ/2), v2 = sin(θ/2).

Wait, because tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2), so v2 = [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ] * cos(θ/2) ) = sin(θ/2).

Wait, wait, let's see: if v1 = cos(θ/2), then v2 = tan(θ/2) * v1 = [ sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) ) ] * cos(θ/2) ) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

But wait, let's check the normalization. The sum of squares is cos^2 + sin^2 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Wait, but the original problem has the operator P·n, which is (ħ/2) times the above matrix. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that would be the answer.

Wait, the options have option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator \( \vec{P} \) along an arbitrary direction \( \vec{n} \) in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \). The operator \( \vec{P} \) is given in terms of its components \( P_x \), \( P_y \), and \( P_z \), and the direction \( \vec{n} \) lies in the x-z plane, so \( \vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta) \). The operator along \( \vec{n} \) is \( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta \).

### Step 1: Construct the matrix for \( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \)
The components of \( \vec{P} \) are:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Since \( \vec{n} \) lies in the x-z plane, \( P_y \) does not contribute. The operator \( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \) is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \lambda I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]
where \( \lambda = +\hbar/2 \). Subtracting \( \lambda I \) from the matrix:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \lambda I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of this matrix must be zero:
\[
\left( \cos\theta - 1 \right)\left( -\cos\theta - 1 \right) - \sin^2\theta = 0.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
-(\cos\theta - 1)(\cos\theta + 1) - \sin^2\theta = -\cos^2\theta + 1 - \sin^2\theta = 0,
\]
which is satisfied. Thus, the eigenvector satisfies:
\[
\left( \cos\theta - 1 \right)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0.
\]
From this, \( v_2 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1 \). Let \( v_1 = \cos(\theta/2) \), then \( v_2 = \sin(\theta/2) \).

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is already normalized since \( \cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1 \).

### Step 4: Match with the options
The normalized eigenvector is \( (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)) \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
