Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The problem is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. They provided the IR and NMR data for Compound X, along with four options. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in a substitution reaction, maybe something like the substitution of a leaving group with HI. But wait, isn't that the case for something like a SN2 reaction or maybe a substitution where a good leaving group is present?

Let me start by analyzing the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. The IR data shows strong peaks. Looking at the IR ranges: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests there might be an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H, but since this is a substitution reaction, maybe it's O-H. Wait, the other peaks are 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 is a strong peak, which could indicate a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton (though aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm) or an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, the broad signal could be because it's exchanging—like an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. So 10.5 ppm sounds more like a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's an aldehyde, maybe it's a proton adjacent to a carbonyl. Or maybe it's an alcohol? Hmm, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which could correspond to a carbonyl. So if there's a carbonyl and a broad peak at 10.5, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. In
