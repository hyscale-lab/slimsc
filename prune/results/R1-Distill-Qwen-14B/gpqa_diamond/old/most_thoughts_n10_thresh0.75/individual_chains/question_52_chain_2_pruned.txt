Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again and see what's going on.

So, the question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question involves the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They say that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. And we need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and we can assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds in the photosphere.

Hmm. So I think this is about the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So I need to find (n1/n2) without spots divided by (n1/n2) with spots. Or wait, the ratio is n1/n2. When spots are present, this ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, the ratio itself is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because the energy difference is E2 - E1.

Wait, let's be precise. The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) ), assuming i and j are different energy levels. So if level 1 is lower than level 2, then E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 is positive. So the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So what's happening?

Let me think. Without spots, Teff is higher (6000 K), with spots it's lower (5500 K). So when the star is cooler, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So what's the behavior of n1/n2 with temperature?

Because E2 is higher than E1, the exponent is negative. So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)) smaller. Because the denominator is smaller, so the whole exponent is more negative. So the exponential term gets smaller as T goes down.

If the exponential term is smaller, then the ratio n1/n2 is smaller. So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is lower. That's exactly what the problem says. So when spots are present, the ratio decreases, so the ratio without spots is higher.

Wait, but in the formula, the ratio is (g1/g2) multiplied by exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE=E2-E1 is positive.

So when T decreases, the exponential term gets smaller, making the ratio smaller. So without spots, the T is higher, so the ratio is larger. So when you compare the ratio without spots to the ratio with spots, you take (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me write that as a factor F:

F = [
