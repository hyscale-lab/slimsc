Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The particles involved are Pi(+) and mu(+). The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for mu(+). The options are four pairs of kinetic energies, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, we have to consider conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, its momentum is zero, so the products must have equal and opposite momenta. That would mean their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very small mass, but I think in this case, the problem might be treating the neutrino as massless. Or do I need to consider its mass? Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't mention the mass of the neutrino, so maybe we can assume it's negligible. Or perhaps the neutrino's mass is considered, but I'm not sure. Hmm, this is a point I need to clarify.

Wait, the question asks for the KE of the product particles. So, two products: mu(+) and nu. Since the pion is at rest, both the muon and the neutrino will have kinetic energy. But wait, particles with mass can't have zero velocity because the neutrino might have some KE, but if the neutrino is considered massless (like in the approximation), then all its energy would be kinetic. I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the problem expects me to treat the neutrino as massless.

Wait, but in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps it's considered massless because the mass is much smaller than the other particles. So, let's proceed under that assumption.

So, the initial energy is the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The rest energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV. Since the pion is at rest,
