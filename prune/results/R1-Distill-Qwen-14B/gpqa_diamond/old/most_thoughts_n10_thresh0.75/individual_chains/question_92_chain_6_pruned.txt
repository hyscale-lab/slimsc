Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound's formula is given as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

Wait, the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I need to figure out how many bonds are formed and broken, and use the given bond energies to calculate the total.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, wait, atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its constituent atoms. So for carbon, it's the energy to break a C-C bond? Or wait, no, wait. Enthalpy of atomization would be the energy to break a carbon atom into individual atoms. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

Wait, the bond energies given are for various bonds. The problem gives bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, maybe that's the energy to break a C-C bond? Or perhaps it's the energy to turn a mole of carbon into individual atoms. Wait, the bond energy for C-C is 200 kJ/mol. So perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break all the bonds in carbon (like graphite or diamond) into individual atoms. But wait, for the purposes of calculating enthalpy of formation, maybe I can ignore that part and focus on the bonds in the compound.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's review what enthalpy of formation involves. The standard enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula: ΔHf° = Σ ΔH (bonds broken) - Σ ΔH (bonds formed). Or wait, no: wait, when calculating using bond energies, the formula is ΔH = Σ (bonds broken) - Σ (bonds formed). Because bond breaking is endothermic (positive ΔH), bond forming is exothermic (negative ΔH), so overall it's (sum of bond
