Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's see what the question is.

So, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they have a super fast spacecraft. The speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, that's really close to c. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years, but the astronaut is 22 years old. We need to find out how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, right?

Wait, wait. The question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so it's about proper time or the time measured in their own frame of reference. Because when you travel at such high speeds, time dilation occurs. Oh right, time dilation in special relativity.

So, the formula I remember is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Gamma tells us how much time dilation occurs. So the time experienced on the spacecraft (proper time) is the coordinate time divided by gamma, or wait, maybe I have that backwards.

Wait, no. From the perspective of the Earth, the spaceship is moving, so the Earth's frame would see the spaceship's clocks running slow. But from the spaceship's frame, the Earth is moving, but due to length contraction, the distance is shorter, so the time taken is less.

Wait, maybe I should start by calculating the gamma factor first because that's crucial for figuring out time dilation.

So, v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute v²/c². Let's compute v²: (0.99999987)^2 times c². Wait, 0.99999987 is really close to 1. Let me calculate that squared. 0.99999987^2 is approximately 0.9999997400000001. So 1 minus that would be 0.00000026, right? Wait, 1 - 0.99999974 is 0.00000026. So 1 - v²/c² is 0.00000026. The square root of that would be sqrt(0.00000026). Let me
