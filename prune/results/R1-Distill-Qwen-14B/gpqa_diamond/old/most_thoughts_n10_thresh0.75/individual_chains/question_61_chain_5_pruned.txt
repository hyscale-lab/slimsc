Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let me read the question carefully.

So the starting material is benzene. Then it's treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating mixture (HNO3 with H2SO4 as a catalyst) is used for nitration. Benzene under nitration forms nitrobenzene, right? So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Iron powder is a catalyst for electrophilic substitution, maybe acting as a Lewis acid? Wait, wait. Oh, wait, no. Iron in such conditions is more likely used for bromination. Actually, when Fe is present with Br2, it's the bromide ions that might form. Or maybe it's a Fittig reaction? Hmm, wait no. Another approach: Benzene with Br2 and Fe is probably a bromination. But nitrobenzene is more reactive than benzene towards electrophilic substitution because nitro is a meta-directing group. So the bromine would enter at the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, nitro group is a meta director, so bromine should add in the meta position. So the bromine would be in position 3 relative to the nitro group. Let me think about the numbering. Nitrobenzene has the nitro group in position 1. So the bromine would be in position 3.

Wait, no, nitro is in position 1, so the meta positions are 3 and 5. Hmm. Wait, benzene is a ring. So when nitro is in position 1, the meta is position 3 and 5, but since it's a single nitro group, the major product would have bromine in position 3. So product 2 would be 3-bromo-nitrobenzene, perhaps. Or is it more like nitrobenzene with a bromine added meta?

Wait, no, the product is 3-bromonitrobenzene. So that's product 2.

Then, product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. So that's a hydrogenation step. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Hydrogenation of a nitro group would typically reduce it to an amino group. So nitro (NO2)
