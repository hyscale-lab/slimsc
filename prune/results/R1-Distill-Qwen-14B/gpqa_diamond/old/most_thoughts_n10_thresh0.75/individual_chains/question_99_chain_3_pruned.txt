Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which are carboxylic acids because they end with COOH. So the first thing I'll note is that the functional group here is a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad and around that region, like 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. So that's consistent with a -COOH group. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which fits with a carbonyl group (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around 1700, so that also makes sense.

Now onto the NMR. The 1H NMR shows several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So that tells me there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens (like in alkenes), which is not an issue here because all the options seem to be saturated compounds. So we don't have to worry about any vinylic protons.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about what that could mean. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. So each splitting indicates how many neighboring Hs are there. For example, a triplet comes from coupling with two equivalent protons (n+1 rule, where n=2 gives triplet). But when you have more complex splitting, like a doublet of triplets, it suggests that a proton is splitting into two, then each of those is splitting into three, etc. So the first proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons.

Let me consider each of the structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like a central carbon (maybe the two CH groups) connected to ethyl groups and a CH2COOH group. Wait, actually, looking at the formula, it's more like:

The carbon chain is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central two carbons each have a CH group (with substituents). Let me draw this out. 

Wait, maybe it's a geminal di-substituted structure. Let me see: the two middle carbons each have a CH group. Each CH is attached to another group. So the two middle CH groups each have a CH3 and a C2H5 group. Hmm, perhaps it's a structure like:

CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle carbons has two substituents, a methyl (CH3) and an ethyl (C2H5), but wait, that might not be the case.

Wait, maybe each of the middle carbons is attached to two ethyl groups and a CH3? No, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So each middle carbon is attached to a methyl (CH3), an ethyl (C2H5), and two hydrogens. So each of the middle CH groups has two substituents: one methyl and one ethyl. So each CH is CH with substituents: CH3, C2H5, and H. So each CH has two substituents (but wait, a carbon can only have four bonds, so the structure would be CH2? No, wait, no.

Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle carbons is connected to a CH3 group, a C2H5 group, and two H's. No, wait, each of those carbons has a CH group, meaning each has two H's. So each of the middle carbons is CH with substituents: one CH3 and one C2H5. So each is CH(CH3)(C2H5).

Wait, no, hold on. The formula is written as CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So each C is connected to a methyl, an ethyl, and another group. Let me count the substituents.

The first carbon after CH3 is C(H)(C2H5). So that's a CH with substituents: a methyl group (from CH3), an ethyl group, and another H. Wait, but CH3 is the first carbon. So the first carbon is CH3. The next carbon is connected to H, C2H5, and the next carbon. The next carbon is also C(H)(C2H5), so connected to H, C2H5, and the previous and next carbons. Finally, the last CH2 is connected to COOH.

So the structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH

So the middle two carbons each have a CH group with substituents. So each CH is
