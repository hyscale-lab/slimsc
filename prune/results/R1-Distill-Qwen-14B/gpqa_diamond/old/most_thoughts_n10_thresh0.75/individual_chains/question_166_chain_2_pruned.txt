Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The question gives a Lagrangian with some fields. Let's see: the fields are N_R (right-handed singlet fermions), phi (a singlet scalar), and S (a scalar doublet). The terms in the Lagrangian include kinetic terms for N_R, a kinetic term for phi, gauge covariant derivatives for S, some Yukawa terms, and a potential V involving phi, S, and H. Wait, H isn't mentioned earlier, but maybe it's part of the scalar fields. Oh right, in the potential, H is another scalar, probably a doublet since S is a doublet.

The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given: ⟨phi⟩² = x² + v², and ⟨h⟩ = v. Wait, but phi has a VEV of x? Because it's ⟨phi⟩ = x, and ⟨h⟩ = v. So perhaps h is another field, maybe the Higgs? Or maybe phi is a singlet that gets a VEV along with the Higgs?

Wait, the problem mentions that the potential V depends on phi, S, and H. So H is another scalar, possibly another doublet? Or perhaps H is the CP-odd scalar in the Higgs sector. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons usually arise when a symmetry is broken, but not completely. In the Standard Model, for example, the Higgs mechanism breaks the symmetry, and the Goldstone bosons are absorbed by the W and Z bosons. But in extensions, sometimes new Goldstone bosons are present, especially when there's a more complicated scalar sector.

Wait, but this model has S as a scalar doublet. So maybe S is part of the Higgs sector. Let me think about the Higgs field in the Standard Model. The Higgs field is a doublet, which after
