Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see...

The question is about an electron's state and measuring probabilities for a certain operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional—so I might need to normalize it later. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, which I know are the standard spin-up and spin-down states.

So, the first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator's matrix elements A_ij are given as hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. That matrix must be 2x2 since we're dealing with two states.

Wait, let me write out the matrix A. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So, matrix A looks like:

[ 0    (hbar/2) ]
[ (hbar/2)  0 ]

Hmm, that's interesting. So this operator is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So this A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because A_ij = (hbar/2) * sigma_x_ij.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are the |+x> and |-x> states. These are the eigenstates for the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, so the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator, which are |+x> and |-x>. Then, we're also to find the average value of the operator.

But wait, |alpha> is in the z-basis. So I need to express |alpha> in the x-basis, or perhaps find the projection of |alpha> onto the eigenstates of A.

But maybe a better approach is to diagonalize the operator A and find its eigenstates, then compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A is proportional to the spin-x
