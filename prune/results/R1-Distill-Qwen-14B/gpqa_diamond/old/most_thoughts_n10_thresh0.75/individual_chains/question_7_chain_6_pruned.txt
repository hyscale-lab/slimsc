Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are in the GeV range, which is pretty high energy.

Wait, I remember that when particles like gamma-rays interact with the CMB, their mean free path is limited, which affects how far they can travel. If the interaction probability is high enough, they might annihilate quickly, so their lifetime is limited. I think this has something to do with pair production—since gamma-rays are high energy, they can annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs.

The process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. For this to happen, the gamma must have enough energy. The threshold condition for this reaction is that the combined energy of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron (since that's the minimum energy needed to produce the particles at rest). The electron's rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so each photon needs to contribute enough energy so that their combined energy meets this threshold.

Wait, wait. The CMB photons are at low energy—1e-3 eV each. The gamma-ray is high energy, say E. So in the center-of-momentum frame, the total energy would be E + E_cmb. But wait, actually, the CMB photon has energy E_cmb, and the gamma has energy E. In the lab frame, assuming the gamma is moving much faster than the CMB photon, which is isotropic but at a low energy.

Ah, right! The threshold condition occurs when the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least twice the electron mass (because each electron has 0.511 MeV, so two of them sum to about 1.022 MeV). Alternatively, the invariant quantity s must be ≥ (2m_e c²)^2.

So the invariant s is (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (p_γ c + p_cmb c)^2 (but in CMB frame, the photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta might be opposite). Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should use
