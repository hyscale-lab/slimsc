Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptidic compound. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum is mostly as expected. Except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So that makes me think that maybe the protons are split in some way. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Wait, why would that be? Spin-spin coupling usually causes splitting into multiple peaks. But if the two peaks are from the same proton, maybe they're not coupled to each other but something else. Or perhaps it's a different kind of splitting.

Then, looking at the LC-MS data: two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So the mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule, but there are two peaks. That suggests that there are two different compounds with the same mass? How is that possible? If the molecular formula is the same, maybe they're isomers or something else.

Let's consider the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. A precursor would have a different molecular weight, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction, maybe it's missing a part. So in the LC-MS, the mass would be lower, but the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So A doesn't fit.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight because they're mirror images. In the NMR, for prochiral centers, you might see different shifts, but in this case, the alpha-proton is showing two peaks. Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, wouldn't the NMR show a single peak because the protons are equivalent in each enantiomer? Or wait, maybe the compound is not chiral, but the environment is causing something else. Hmm, I'm not sure. Enantiomers would have same mass, but same NMR shifts? Or if the environment is causing different shifts. Wait, in some cases, like if the sample isn't pure, or maybe if the peak is split due to another reason. But the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same shift. Wait, no, the shifts are similar but not the same. Oh the peaks have similar chemical shifts, not same. So maybe diastereomers instead?

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. I remember that in peptide synthesis, when forming amide bonds, sometimes the reaction can lead to different coupling scenarios. For example, maybe there's a possibility of getting some double bonds or something else. Or perhaps it's about the stereochemistry. Wait, 'double coupling' sounds a bit vague. Maybe it refers to the possibility of more than one coupling event, leading to diastereomers. Or perhaps it's about the formation of more than one product during the coupling, leading to different diastereomers.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR shifts. But wait, in the question, the two peaks for the alpha-proton have similar shifts. So if it's diastereomers, their peaks would split further, maybe? But if the alpha-proton is in a different environment, the shifts would be different. So perhaps the two diastereomers have the same environment for that alpha-proton, leading to similar shifts. But that's a bit unlikely.

Wait, but the question says that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrate to 1H. So for each diastereomer, the alpha-proton would be in a different environment, leading to different shifts. But if they are similar, maybe they're not too different.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the stereochemistry of adjacent groups, leading to coupling in the NMR. But the question says coupling is ruled out.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have a different NMR. But if the alpha-proton's environment is the same in both, then their shifts would be the same, leading to a single peak. But that's not the case here. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: the two peaks in the NMR are due to a single proton that's split into two due to a J coupling, but the user said they've ruled out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not that.

Wait, but the problem states that it's the same alpha-proton. So both peaks come from the same proton. But how? Maybe the proton is in a dynamic environment, like if the molecule is exchanging between two forms quickly on the NMR timescale. But that would usually cause a peak, not two separate ones.

Alternatively, could it be that the proton is being split by another proton? But the question says that
