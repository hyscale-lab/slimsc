Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many of the given compounds are optically active. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So I need to go through each compound one by one and check for any such centers.

Let's list the compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one

Alright, let's tackle each one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me draw the structure. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2. Wait, no. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but here it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-CR2=CR'2. Let me think, but-1-ene has double bond between C1 and C2. So substituents: at C1, we have Cl and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene: the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, perhaps I should structure it as Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure: Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and perhaps a CH2 group. Let me think: the molecule is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So if it's 2-methyl, the structure becomes CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Alternatively, maybe we have 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene as Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2?

Wait, I
