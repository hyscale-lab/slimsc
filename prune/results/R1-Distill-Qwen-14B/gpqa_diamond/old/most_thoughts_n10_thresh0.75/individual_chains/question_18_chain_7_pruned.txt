Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Let me try to think through this step by step. Sometimes I get a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I get the details right. 

We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, does mass matter here? The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass affects the way elements are distributed, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I can set that aside for now and focus on the abundances given.

The abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. They give [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Wait, what's the notation here? Oh right, the brackets mean logarithmic abundance ratios relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly, log(nMg/nH) is 7 -12 = -5.

Wait, wait. Let me make this clear. The notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals some number. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 â†’ log(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, it's 7 -12 =
