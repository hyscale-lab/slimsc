Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is that there's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. 

Now, the question is about a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have and still exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm. Okay, so I think I need to understand what transit and occultation mean here. Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, which might not be as obvious but is detectable through other methods, like looking at the light curve for a corresponding change.

But for both events to happen, the orbital periods must be such that the two planets are in the same orbital plane and their orbital periods allow for these events. Wait, more specifically, for both planets to transit and occult each other, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital speeds and positions allow for these events.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The problem says the second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, when Planet B transits (passes in front of the star), and when it's occulted (passes behind the star). So the question is about Planet B's period, given that Planet A has a 3-day period.

I think Kepler's third law will come into play here because we're dealing with orbital periods and distances. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since both orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the radius.

But wait, the periods are related to their distances from the star. The star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's, but that probably doesn't affect the orbital period directly. Hmm.

But wait, the transit impact parameter is given for Planet A. The impact parameter is the distance of the planet's path from the center of the star's disk, divided by
