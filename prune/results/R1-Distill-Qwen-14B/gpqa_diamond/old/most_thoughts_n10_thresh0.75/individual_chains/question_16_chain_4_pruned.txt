Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me think through it step by step. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them exhibit optical activity. The options are A to D, with the possible answers ranging from 2 to 5. 

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, some compounds might have other forms of asymmetry, like axial chirality, but I think for this question, focusing on chiral centers should suffice.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm. The structure is CH2=CH-C(Cl)-something? Wait, wait, the name is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 would be Cl, a double bond (to C2), and two CH3 groups? Wait, but wait, but-1-ene has four carbons. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. Let me draw it:

Structure: Cl-C(=CH2-CH(CH3)?) Wait, no. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the molecule is CH2=C(Cl)CH2CH3? No, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So:

Cl

CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH3? Or wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So the structure is Cl-C(H)=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, but it's 2-methyl. So the C2 has a methyl group. Wait, but I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So around C1, the substituents are Cl, double bond (which is like a substituent group), and two CH2 or CH3 groups?

Wait, let
