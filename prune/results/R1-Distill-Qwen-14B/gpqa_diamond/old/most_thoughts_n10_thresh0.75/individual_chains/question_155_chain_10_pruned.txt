Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z. 

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. Oh right, so I can't directly say that ⟨P_z⟩ is just the eigenvalue times something because the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z.

So, first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in the given state. Then compute ⟨P_z²⟩, and then plug them into the uncertainty formula.

To compute the expectation values, I'll need the matrix representation of P_z. Let me look again. The matrix for P_z is:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

The state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Wait, but I should make sure it's normalized. Let me check: |(-1/2)|² + (1/sqrt(2))² + |(-1/2)|². That's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. Oh, so it's normalized. Good.

To get ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Let me write this out. The state is a column vector [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So, P_z |
