Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework used to describe the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators that are consistent with certain symmetries.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry? I remember that Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in the context of effective field theories, I think the SMEFT is based on Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily Poincare because effective theories are usually formulated in a fixed background, like Minkowski space, without worrying about global symmetries like translations. So maybe Poincare isn't a required symmetry that all operators must respect? Or does SMEFT consider Poincare?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. But in most effective field theories, the translations are handled by considering the theory is valid in a specific frame, maybe the center of mass frame or something. So maybe the operators don't have to respect Poincare symmetry explicitly because SMEFT is a theory in a fixed spacetime, perhaps. Or perhaps the operators are constructed in such a way that they respect Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily Poincare. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Next, CP symmetry. I know that the Standard Model is almost CP symmetric, except for certain parts like the CKM matrix. But in SMEFT, operators can violate CP if the underlying physics includes such effects. Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator violates CP, would that be allowed in SMEFT? Or must all operators respect CP?

Wait, I think that SMEFT allows for operators that can break various symmetries, including CP. So perhaps not all operators respect CP symmetry. Hmm, but wait, the question is about which symmetries MUST be respected. So maybe the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry, so CP isn't a must. Unless the SMEFT framework itself enforces CP, but I don't think so. Because SMEFT is
