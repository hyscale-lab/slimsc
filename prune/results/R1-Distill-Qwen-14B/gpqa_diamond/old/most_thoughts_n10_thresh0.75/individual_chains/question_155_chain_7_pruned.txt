Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So I guess I'm working in the eigenbasis of P_z. That's probably important because it simplifies some things, maybe.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So this is a three-component vector. Let me note that down.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, when we measure P_x, it will definitely give the eigenvalue -ħ. But for P_z, since the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z (the basis is that of P_z, but the state is expressed in that basis), we can't be certain about P_z. That's why we're looking for the uncertainty.

So I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, wait. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, each basis vector |n> corresponds to a
