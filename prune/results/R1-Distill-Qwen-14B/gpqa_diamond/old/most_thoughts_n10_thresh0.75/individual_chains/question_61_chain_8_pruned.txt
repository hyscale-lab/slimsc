Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think through each reaction.

The question involves benzene going through a series of reactions, and I need to determine the final product from the options given. Let's break it down step by step.

First, benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration is a typical reaction for benzene. Nitration uses a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. The nitronium ion is the electrophile. Nitration occurs typically at the meta or para positions, but wait, benzene without any directing groupsâ€”wait, no, benzene has no substituents except itself, so the nitration can occur in any position, but generally, it's a meta director?

Wait, no, wait. Benzene is symmetric, so when you nitrate benzene, the product is nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta-directing group, but in this case, the first product is just mono-nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene. Wait, but wait, benzene can form more than one product? No, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene as the main product because it's the most stable, with the nitro group in the meta position. Wait, no. Wait, the nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene
