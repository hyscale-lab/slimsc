Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the potentials at a later time t when t is greater than the time tr, which is when the field was generated. The field point is r, and d is the vector from where the charge was at time tr to the observation point r.

Wait, so the setup is about retarded potentials, right? Because when charges are moving, the fields at a later time depend on where the charge was earlier. That makes sense because the electromagnetic effects can't travel faster than the speed of light, so the fields at a point are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

So, the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t are to be determined. I remember that the potentials are typically expressed using integrals over the charge's history, but in the case of a single moving charge, maybe there's a simpler expression.

Wait, the scalar potential for a static charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, the potentials might involve terms from the velocity. Hmm, but how?

I think the general expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge involve the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The scalar potential V is given by something like (q/(4πε₀)) times 1 divided by the distance at the retarded time, but how does the velocity come into play?

Wait, no. Wait, the scalar potential V is actually just the static potential adjusted for the retarded time, right? Because the charge's position at time tr is what contributes to V. But the vector potential A comes from the current due to the charge's motion.

Oh, right. The vector potential A is due to the current element, which depends on the charge's velocity. So the formula for A should involve the velocity.

Wait, I think the formula for the vector potential is something like (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) times the unit vector in the direction of d or something like that. Or maybe it's in terms of d and the velocity.

Wait, the options have several forms
