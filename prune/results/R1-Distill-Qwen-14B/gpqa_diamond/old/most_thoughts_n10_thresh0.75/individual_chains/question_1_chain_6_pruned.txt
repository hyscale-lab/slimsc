Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE > something. Wait, I think the resolving condition is that the energy difference between the two levels should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than each's uncertainty, then their energy measurements wouldn't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference should be greater than the maximum uncertainty, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Suppose the two states have energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2. To resolve them, the separation between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than the sum, then there could be an overlap in the possible energy ranges, making it hard to distinguish.

Wait, so the condition would be |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Because each energy level has an uncertainty,
