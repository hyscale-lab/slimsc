Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not super important right now. The question is about the orbital periods of these planets.

The given data points are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and their masses. The albedo for all three is the same, 0.3, which is Earth-like. We need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. That means Planet2 is hotter than Planet1. Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet3 is even hotter than Planet2. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( ( (1 - albedo) ) / (2 * (1 + e)^(1/2) ) )^(1/2) * (L / (16 * pi * sigma * D^2 )) )^(1/4), but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the simplified form when the orbit is circular (e=0) and albedo is known is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) ), but wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature without greenhouse effect is given by the formula:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 D)} ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But if all planets have the same albedo, then the (1 - albedo) term is the same for each, so it doesn't affect the ratio. So the ratio of temperatures would depend on the square root of the inverse of their distances.

Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because if you have T proportional to 1/sqrt(D), then the ratio of T1 to T2 would be sqrt(D2/D1
