Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The substances given are all benzene derivatives, and I need to figure out the order of their yields of the para-isomer. Hmm, right, electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic rings depend a lot on the substituents' directing effects. 

Wait, each substituent directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Electron-donating groups activate the ring and direct incoming groups to specific positions, whereas electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring and also direct. Let me think about each substituent.

The substances are numbered 1 to 6:

1: C6H5-CH3 → methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group, and it's ortho/para-directing. So the incoming Br would go para to it.

2: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → that's a benzoyloxyethyl group? Or wait, no, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-C2H5 attached to benzene? Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a benzoyloxy group. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group attached to an ethoxy. No, wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Wait, that's like an ester group. So the substituent is O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-Et. So the substituent is a carbonyloxyethyl group, like a carbonyl (CO) attached to OEt. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to think of the substituent as a carbonyl group (like a ketone), but that's not right because COO would be an ester. Maybe the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group. Wait, maybe I should think of it as a carbonyl group attached to an ethoxy. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating—what matters is the directing effect.

Wait, substituent is COOEt. So that would be an ester group. Ester groups are electron-withdrawing because of the carbonyl. So they are meta-directing and deactivating. So substituent 2 is in a position that directs incoming groups to meta positions.

3: C6H5-Cl → chlorine substituent. Chlorine is an interesting case. It's a slightly deactivating group (because of the electronegativity) but it's ortho/para-directing because the lone pairs can donate into the ring. So Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para-directing group. So in electrophilic substitution, Cl directs to ortho and para.

4: C6H5-NO2 → nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So substituent 4 is a meta director.

5: C6H5-C2H5 → ethyl group attached. So ethyl is similar to methyl, an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So substituent 5 is activating, ortho/para-directing.

6: C6H5-COOH → carboxylic acid group. The substituent is a COOH group. Carboxylic acid is deactivating because the COOH group withdraws electrons through resonance. It's a strong deactivating group. The substituent is meta-directing.

So the substituents here are:

1: methyl (activating, ortho/para)
2: COOEt (deactivating, meta)
3: Cl (deactivating, ortho/para)
4: NO2 (deactivating, meta)
5: ethyl (activating, ortho/para)
6: COOH (deactivating, meta)

Wait, but wait: substituent 3 is Cl. Cl is a meta director? No, wait. Wait, Cl is ortho/para-directing. Oh right! Because Cl is an electronegative atom, but it's more electronegative than the ring
