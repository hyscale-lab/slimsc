Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, wait. Oh wait, no, that's probably a vector, but I think in quantum mechanics, states are represented as column vectors, so that must be our initial state vector.

The problem involves two observables, P and Q, each represented by a matrix. We're told to find the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q right after P.

Wait, but the way measurements work is that measuring one observable affects the state, right? So first we measure P, which collapses the state into an eigenstate of P, and then measure Q on that new state. But wait, in this case, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is P first, then Q.

Wait, but the problem says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q." So I think we need to find the probability that when we measure P, we get 0, and then when we measure Q on the resulting state, we get -1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the joint probability of both happening in sequence. But I think that's the standard approach in quantum mechanics: first measure P, which gives 0, then measure Q, which gives -1.

Alternatively, maybe
