Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, I've heard about such reactions before, but I need to think through the details.

First, I should probably write down what I know. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so when it reacts with a strong acid, it'll undergo a neutralization reaction. The acid is monobasic, meaning it donates one proton per molecule. So, the reaction should produce water and the corresponding salt. Let me write that out.

The balanced chemical equation should be Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Yeah, that makes sense because Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so it needs three H+ ions from HCl to neutralize each OH-.

Next, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I'm starting with. The mass given is 0.1 grams, and I think I need the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let me calculate that. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + (3*(1 + 16)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, that's 9.36e-4 moles.

Since Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl per mole of Fe(OH)3, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles. Oh, but wait, the question is about the volume of 0.1 M HCl needed. Molarity is moles per liter, so volume (L) = moles / molarity. So, 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, that's about 28.1 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is really close. So maybe that's the volume needed.

But wait, the question says "minimum volume" which implies that all the Fe(OH)3 must dissolve. So if I'm using just enough to neutralize it, that's the minimum. But wait, could there be any excess acid left? Because sometimes when you dissolve a hydroxide, you might need some excess acid beyond the stoichiometric amount to actually get all the solid to dissolve. Oh, right, Fe(OH)3 is not very soluble in water, but it can dissolve in strong acids. But in this problem, I think we're assuming that all of it dissolves when provided with enough acid for the reaction. So the minimum volume is just the stoichiometric amount needed for the reaction. So the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. Let's think about what's in the solution after the reaction. After adding the HCl, the Fe(OH)3 has reacted to form FeCl3 and water. So the solution will contain FeCl3, which is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a
