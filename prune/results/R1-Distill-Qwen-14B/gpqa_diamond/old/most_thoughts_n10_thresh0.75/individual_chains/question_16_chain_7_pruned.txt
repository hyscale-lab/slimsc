Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in various organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's a chiral center, which is a carbon attached to four different groups. So I need to check each compound given to see if they have any chiral centers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Wait, the structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Or wait, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be ClCH2C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group. So the molecule is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in this case, it's 1-chloro, so the Cl is on C1. So the molecule is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Looking at C1: Cl, then two CH2 groups? Wait no, C1 is Cl attached to a CH2 group. Let me think. The structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the groups on C1 are Cl, CH2 (maybe), and two CH2 groups? No, wait, C1 is connected to Cl, CH2-C(...), and two other groups. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it.

1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the molecule is: Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but that's butene, so four carbons. So positions 1 and 2 are double bonded. So it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 and C4 are CH2 and CH3 maybe. Wait, maybe it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl), and after that, C3 and C4 are single bonds. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so numbering from the double bond. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is the one with the double bond. So the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule looks like Cl attached to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is double-bonded to a CH2. Wait, no, but it's 1-chloro, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So that would make it CH2
