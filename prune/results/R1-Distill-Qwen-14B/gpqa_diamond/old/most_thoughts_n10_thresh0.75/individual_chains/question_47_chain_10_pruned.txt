Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me try to walk through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So that's (2*9 + 2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 3), an amide group (which is another one, maybe), and an ester or something else.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. If it's a primary amine, you'd see a broad peak around 3300-3500. But wait, if it's an amide, the N-H would be around 3300 as well, but maybe a little lower. Also, the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That peak is likely a carbonyl group, maybe an amide or ester or ketone. Since the molecular formula includes O2, it's probably either an ester or amide.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm triplet (3H) – that looks like a CH2CH3 group, maybe an ethyl ester. Because in an ethyl group, the triplet at around 1.2 ppm is typical for the CH3 next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) – broad singlet could be an NH group if it's an amide, but wait, if it's an ester, then maybe it's an OCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's something else. Wait, the H NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Also, 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q, 2H). Quartet at 4.5 ppm. Quartet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe that's the OCH2CH2 group. Wait, but wait, in an ethyl ester, you'd have the CH3 as triplet at 1.2, then the OCH2 as quartet around 4.0-4.3. So the quartet at 4.5 is a bit high for an ethyl ester, but let's see. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an amide's OCH2.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Broad can mean exchange with protons, like NH. So maybe that's an amide NH. But wait, in an amide, the NH
