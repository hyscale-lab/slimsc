Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a proton and an antiproton are annihilating each other to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh right, so that probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate it using non-relativistic or perhaps some relativistic considerations but with low speeds.

But wait, what's the setup here? I think this is a conservation of energy and momentum problem. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can assume that the system's center of mass frame is moving at the same speed as the antiproton? Or perhaps not, because the proton is at rest.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, but it's not clear whether the proton is at rest or moving. Oh, wait, I think in these kinds of problems, the proton is usually considered at rest unless stated otherwise. So maybe the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the proton and antiproton would annihilate, but here it's producing two A+ and two A- particles. So perhaps we're to consider the process in the center of mass frame, but the initial momentum might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the antiproton is moving so slowly that its kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Each has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. But the products are four particles each with mass 300 MeV/c². So each A has mass 300 MeV/c², so four of them would be 4*300=1200 MeV.
