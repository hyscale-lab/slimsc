Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass of each is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, and the answer needs to be correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that the potential energy in an electrostatic system is calculated based on the configuration of the charges. Since all the charges are the same, the way they're arranged will affect the total potential energy.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters from P, meaning each is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge. But I also need to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves because they're all at the same point, but wait, no—wait, the question says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe they're all at the same point 2m away from P? Or are they arranged in some other way?

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So I think that implies that each of the 12 charges is located at a distance of 2 meters from P. But where exactly? Are they all at the same point, or arranged in a sphere or something? The problem doesn't specify their spatial arrangement beyond being 2m from P. Hmm, but for potential energy, I think the exact positions might not matter in the same way. Wait, no, because the potential energy between each pair of charges depends on their separation.

Wait, maybe I need to think about this. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Then, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the central charge. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Since they're all 2 meters from P, their mutual distances could vary depending on their positions relative to each other. Oh, but the problem doesn't specify their configuration, so perhaps the minimal energy is achieved when the 12 charges are placed in a way that the potential energy between them is as low as possible. Wait, but wait—potential energy between like charges is always positive because the charges are positive (since each is 2e, which is positive if e is the elementary charge). So bringing them closer together would increase the potential energy, right? Because the potential energy for like charges increases as they get closer.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, for two point charges, the potential energy is U = k * (q1 q2) / r. Since all charges are positive (2e each), when you bring them closer, the potential energy increases because r decreases, making U larger (since it's positive). So to minimize the total potential energy, you want the charges to be as far apart as possible. But the problem states that each of the 12 is fixed at 2m from P. So perhaps they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m centered at P. But without knowing their arrangement, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point 2 meters away, but that can't be because then their mutual distances would be zero, leading to infinite potential energy. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are spaced in a way that each is 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, we're supposed to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and also the potential energy between each pair of the 12
