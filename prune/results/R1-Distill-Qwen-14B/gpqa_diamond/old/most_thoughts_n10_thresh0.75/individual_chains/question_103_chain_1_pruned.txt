Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. There are four options given, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence would lead to the desired product with a high yield.

Hmm, first, let me try to break down the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is a bromine, and position 5 is a nitro group. The ethan-1-one part means there's a ketone group (C=O) attached directly to the ring. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group, a bromine, and a nitro group in the 3 and 5 positions.

Wait, wait. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring. The ethan-1-one is attached to the ring. So the benzene ring has a substituent which is a C=O connected to a CH2 group? No, wait. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, but as a substituent. Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is a two-carbon chain where the carbonyl is at position 1. So the structure is CH2(COCH3)- attached to the benzene? No, wait. Let me think. The substituent is ethan-1-one, which is acetophenone. So the structure is benzene with a ketone group (like acetophenone). But wait, the target has 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituent is a phenyl group (with bromo and nitro groups) attached to the ethan-1-one. Wait, no. No, wait. The ethan-1-one is the main chain. So the structure is:

The ethan-1-one is CH2-C(=O)-, and the benzene ring is attached to the CH2. So it's like Ph-CH2-C(=O)-, but wait, no. Wait, acetophenone is Ph-C(=O)-CH3. But the target is 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is (Ph-substituted)-C(=O)-CH2-? No, wait. Let me think again. The IUPAC name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the main chain is ethan-1-one, which is (CH3)2CO? No, wait. Ethyl ketone is butanone, not ethanone. Wait, ethan-1-one is (propan-1-one is propanone, which is acetone). Wait, no. Ethan-1-one would be (CH2)1-C=O. So, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2CH2CH2)C=O. No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look up ethan-1-one.

Wait, the IUPAC name: ethan-1-one. So it's (CH2)2O? No, wait. The parent chain is ethane (two carbons), with the ketone on C1. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH3? No, that's propan-2-one (acetone). Oh wait, ethan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH3? No, because the longest chain would be three carbons for acetone. Wait, maybe ethan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be pentan-1-one. I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps ethan-1-one
