Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some mutation. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound and it has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate the compound using EMS mutagenesis, and they sequenced the target gene in all mutants.

The question is about which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound. So, the idea is that if the gene is not functional, the compound won't be made. So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Looking at the sequences, the intact gene is provided, and then each mutant has a different change. Let's compare each mutant to the wild type.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let me look at each mutant.

Mutant 1: It starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Comparing to the wild type, the first part: the wild type after ATG is TTTCTC... Wait, let me write out the wild type and mutants to spot differences.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA.
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG C... Wait, wait, let me look at the first part.

Wait, the wild type is:

5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTT CT ACG C… Wait, no, let me see. The first part of mutant 1:

ATG TTT CT ACG C... Wait, the wild type's first few nucleotides after ATG are TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc. Let me line them up:

Wild type: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Wait, so comparing each nucleotide:

Wild: positions 4-8 are TTTCT (ATG is 1-3, then TTT is 4-6). Let's see:

Wild: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1: ...TTT CT ACG C... Wait, maybe it's better to look at where the differences are.

Wait, another approach: let's see where each mutant differs from the wild type.

Wild type: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG G
