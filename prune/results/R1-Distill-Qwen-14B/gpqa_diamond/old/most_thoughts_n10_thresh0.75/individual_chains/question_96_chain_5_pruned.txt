Okay, so I have this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, right? Oh wait, the formula is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or was it something else? Maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, the entropy formula for a black hole is S = (k_B c³ A) / (4 ħ G), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant. Oh right, that's the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. So I need to find A, the area of the event horizon, and then plug it into this formula to find the entropy.

The problem gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh, right, the angular size θ is given by θ = diameter / distance. But wait, wait. No, θ is the angular diameter, so the actual diameter would be θ multiplied by the distance. Wait, let me think. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ diameter / distance, assuming the distance is much larger than the size, which it is here because it's a black hole in a galaxy far away.

So the event horizon's diameter would be θ × d. But wait, θ is given in degrees. I need to convert that to radians because when calculating the area, I'll probably need to use
