Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the problem says there are three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), so it's like the inverse temperature.

So, each spin can be +1 or -1, so the system has 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. For each state, I need to calculate E and then compute exp(-beta E) for each, then sum them all.

But calculating each state manually might take a while. Maybe there's a smarter way to group states with the same energy. Let's think about how the energy depends on the spins.

The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of pairs. So, E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Let me denote H = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3, so E = -J H. So, the energy depends on H.

Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, right? Because S_i and S_j are each +1 or -1. So each product is either 1 or -1.

Wait, actually, no. Let's see: S_i and S_j can be +1 or -1, so their product is 1 if they are the same, -1 if different. So each term in H is either +1 or -1. So H is the sum of three such terms.

So H can vary. Let me compute all possible H values.

Let's consider all possible states. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3). Each S can be +1 or -1.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many pairs are aligned. Wait, but H is the sum of the products. So H can be 3, 1, -1, -3, etc. Let me compute H for each possible state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of states that give a particular value of H, then compute the contributions to Z from each H.

Let's think about the possible values of H.

Each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum H could be 3 (if all three terms are +1), or 1 (if two are +1 and one is -1), or -1 (if two are -1 and one is +1), or -3 (all three terms are -1). Are there any other possibilities?

Wait, let's think. For three terms, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Because 3 is all +1s, 1 is (2 +1) and (-1), so two +1 and one -1, etc.

So H can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Now, for each possible H, how many states (microstates) give that H? Because each state corresponds to a particular combination of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, but the sum H is S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3. Let me compute H for each possible combination.

Let me list all 8 possible states and compute H for each.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1

Wait, that's H=-1. Hmm.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
H = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
H = (-1)(+
