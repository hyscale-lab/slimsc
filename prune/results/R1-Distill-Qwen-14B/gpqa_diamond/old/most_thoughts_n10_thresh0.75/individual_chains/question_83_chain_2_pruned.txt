Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can figure this out.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, first thing, I guess I need to find the new concentration after dilution. Oh right, the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20.00 cm³, and V2 is 40.00 cm³ because we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. So doing the math: 0.05 * 20 / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh, right, so I need to calculate both these pH values.

Let's tackle the equivalence point first because that's usually the starting point for these titration problems. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate.

Wait, how much acetic acid do we have initially? The diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. So moles of acetic acid is Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O), moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would also be 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question isn't asking for the volume, just the pH at equivalence.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted into its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO⁻). So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will be basic. The pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

So first, I need to find the concentration of acetate ions. The total solution volume at equivalence is the initial acetic acid volume plus the NaOH added. Wait, wait. The initial diluted acetic acid is 40 cm³, and we added 10 cm³ of NaOH at equivalence? Wait no, because in a titration, the equivalence volume is when you
