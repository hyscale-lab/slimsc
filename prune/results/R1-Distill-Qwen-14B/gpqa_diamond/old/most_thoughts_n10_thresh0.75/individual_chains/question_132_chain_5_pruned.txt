Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question says that there's a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene. Hmm.

Let me start by recalling what NMR signals tell us. The aromatic region (around 6.5-7.5 ppm) usually corresponds to protons on the benzene ring. The number of signals here can tell us about the symmetry of the molecule. For instance, highly symmetric structures might have fewer signals because equivalent protons don't split each other.

The problem mentions two singlets in the aromatic region. So each compound must have a structure where the aromatic protons are all equivalent, or perhaps they have two distinct sets of equivalent protons. Wait, but each compound itself would contribute its own set of signals. Since the mixture has two compounds, each contributing their own, but in this case, the aromatic region shows two signals. Oh wait, wait. The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture, and the aromatic signals are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, so each aromatic compound contributes one singlet? Because in a 1:1 mixture, each would be present equally.

Wait, but in a 1:1 mixture, if each compound had one aromatic singlet, then each would contribute equally, so the integration would be 1:1 for those two signals. But wait, the question says the aromatic signals are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet is from one compound, and each is present in equal amounts. So each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, meaning each is a symmetric structure where all the aromatic protons are equivalent.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the structures given. The options are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's list the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,
