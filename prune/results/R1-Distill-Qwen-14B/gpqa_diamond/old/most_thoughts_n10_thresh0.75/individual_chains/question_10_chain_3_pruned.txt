Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the four options. The options are a, b, c, d, each with different mass and radius or density given. So I need to figure out the density for each of these and compare them.

Wait, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh right, volume is (4/3)πr³. So density = mass / volume. But sometimes, if the composition is similar to Earth, like in options c and d, we can make some assumptions.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. I think Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So option a has the same mass and radius, so same density as Earth. So that's 5.5.

Option b: The planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but they directly state the density here. So that's already 5.5. Hmm, same as Earth, but more mass. Or wait, no, because the mass is double. Wait, but if the density is 5.5, then its mass would be density times volume. Wait, but the question says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's given. So density is 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Earth's composition I think is rock and metal, so same density as Earth. So if it's 5 times more massive but same density, then the radius must be larger. Let me think: density is mass/volume. If density is same, then mass is proportional to volume. Volume scales with radius cubed. So if mass is 5 times, then volume is 5 times. So the radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. But wait, the question is about density, so if composition is same, density would be same as Earth. So for option c, density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So again, same density, 5.5. Because density is same as Earth, even if it's less mass. Because density depends on mass over volume.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the mass is less but same composition, does the density stay the same? Let me think. If you have same composition, the density would be same. Because density is an intrinsic property. So if a planet has same composition, regardless of size, the density is same. So options c and d should have same density as Earth, 5.5.

But wait, looking back at the options. Option a is same mass and radius as Earth, so density 5.5. Option b is 2 Earth masses but density already given as 5.5. So same as others.

Wait, but wait, the question is which has the highest density. All of them except maybe option b have 5.5. What about option b?

Option b says it has 2 Earth masses and a density of ~5.5
