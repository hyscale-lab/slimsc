Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with the rotation-vibration model. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule, X and Y, modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. It says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule switches to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, I remember that in the quantum mechanical model, a diatomic molecule's energy levels come from both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, I think the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. For rotation, the energy is given by something like (ħ² R)/(2I) multiplied by some quantum number. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the energy levels for a rigid rotor (rotational model) are E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. For a rigid rotor, the vibrational energy levels are given by the quantum harmonic oscillator equation: E_vib = (hν/2) + ν J_vib (J_vib +1), but I might have that a bit mixed up. Or was it E_vib = (hν/2) [ (J_vib + 1/2) - 1/2 ]? No, maybe the harmonic oscillator has energy levels E_vib = (hν/2)(2n +1), where n is the vibrational quantum number. Wait, no, I think the correct form is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h ν, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

But wait, the problem says it's the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor (sometimes called the rotation-vibration model) combines both rotational and vibrational effects. So the energy levels are a combination of both.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in the lowest possible energy state. That would mean the rotational quantum number J is 0 (since J can't be negative), and the vibrational quantum number n is also 0. So in the fundamental state, J=0 and n=0.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy
