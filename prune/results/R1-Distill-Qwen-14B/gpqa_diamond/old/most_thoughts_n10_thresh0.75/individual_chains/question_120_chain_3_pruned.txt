Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each a different power law.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. If a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number density of stars in space is the same everywhere. So, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume available up to a certain distance.

Let me think about the volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, if I'm considering all stars within a distance d, the volume is proportional to d³. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies with plx. Parallax is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. Let me substitute that.

So the volume up to distance d is proportional to (1/plx)³, which is 1/plx³. But wait, what's the number of stars in that volume? If the distribution is uniform, the number of stars should be proportional to the volume. So number of stars N up to distance d is proportional to (1/plx)³.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Hmm. So suppose I consider a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars would that represent? Let's model this.

The number of stars between parallax plx and plx + dplx would be the difference in N between those two parallaxes. Since N is proportional to (1/plx)³, let's say N = k/(plx)^3, where k is some constant.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx would be N_upper - N_lower. That's [k/( (plx + dplx)^3 )] - [k/(plx^3 )]. 

But for small dplx, we can approximate this using a derivative. Because when the change is small, the difference is approximately the derivative of N with respect to plx multiplied by dplx. So dN = dN/dplx * dplx.

Calculating dN/dplx: the derivative of k/(plx)^3 is -3k/(plx)^4. So dN = (-3k/(plx)^4) * dplx. But wait, the number can't be negative. Oh, right, because as plx increases, distance decreases, so N increases, but the derivative is negative because dN/dplx is negative (since higher plx is lower distance, which is less, but wait no, wait, wait. Let me think carefully.

Wait, no. When plx increases, it means the star is closer. So for a small increase in plx (dplx positive), the distance decreases. So the volume up to that distance is smaller, meaning fewer stars? No, wait. No, wait. No, that's not right. Wait, when plx increases, the distance decreases because plx = 1/d. So a higher plx means a closer star. So the number of stars in a small shell at plx would be?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume per unit plx. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the number of stars per unit plx.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd is the volume of the shell (4π d² dd) multiplied by the star density (n). So the number is 4π n d² dd.

Now, parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Substitute d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx²) dplx.
