Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to find the expectation values of σz and σx separately and then combine them according to the coefficients.

Wait, the state is given as a linear combination. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me check: because for a spin-½ particle, the spin states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So σz acting on |↑⟩ gives 1 times that state, and on |↓⟩ gives -1 times that state, right?

So the expectation value of σz is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their eigenvalues. The probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and the probability of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So the expectation ⟨σz⟩ is 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Oh, wait, because |↓⟩ has eigenvalue -1, so yes, that makes sense.

Now for σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which I think is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The eigenstates of σx are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but rather (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2). So calculating the expectation value of σx might be a bit more involved.

Alternatively, I remember that the expectation value of σx can be found by taking the inner product of the state with σx acting on the state. So maybe I can compute it directly.

Wait, the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. So when I compute ψ† σx ψ. Let me write this out.

The operator σx is represented as:
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]

So, ψ is a column vector [a; b], so ψ† is [a*, b*]. When I multiply ψ† σx, I get [b*, a*]. Then multiplying by ψ gives [b* a, b* b; a* a, a* b]? Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, ψ† σx ψ is a scalar. Let me compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to express σx in terms of its matrix and compute the expectation value. So ψ is (0.
