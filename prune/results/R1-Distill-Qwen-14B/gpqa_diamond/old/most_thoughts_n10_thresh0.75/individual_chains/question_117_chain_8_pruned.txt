Okay, so I've got this question about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the question is asking which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, which are carbons attached to four different groups. Chiral centers can't be superimposed on their mirror images, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers are optically active, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. So, the structure is two phenyl rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups (as methyl esters) at 2 and 2'.

Wait, so each phenyl ring has the carboxylate groups attached? Let's imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a methyl ester (from the dicarboxylate) at position 2. The central single bond between the rings could allow rotation, so maybe the substituents on each ring are in positions that could lead to some symmetry.

But do any of the carbons in the molecule have four different groups attached? The central carbon where the two rings are connected? No, because it's a single bond and the substituents are symmetric. Wait, maybe some of the carbons on the rings have substituents that make them chiral.

Wait, the ester groups are at 2 and 2' positions. So each phenyl group has a COOCH3 group. Let me think about the structure around each ester group. The carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring and a methyl group. The oxygen is connected to the methyl. But the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so maybe that's not a chiral center.

Wait, the ring carbons—each benzene ring is connected to the substituents. Are any of those ring carbons chiral? Benzene rings are flat, and the substituents are at specific positions. But in a benzene ring, each carbon is attached to two other carbons in the ring and two substituents—so that's four groups. Wait, but in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons, a hydrogen (if it's a monosubstituted ring) or other substituents. Wait, but in this case, each ring has two substituents: a nitro group and a carboxylate group.

Wait, let me draw it out mentally. Each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, the structure is something like two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each substituent is NO2 and COOCH3.

Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has two substituents. Let me imagine a single benzene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, for each ring, the substituents are para to each other? Because position 2 and 6 are across the ring.

If that's the case, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Because each ring has substituents that are symmetrically placed. That would mean that the molecule itself is symmetrical, so any possible chiral centers would be identical on both rings, leading to no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the nitro and carboxylate groups? Let's think about each substituent. The nitro group is a strong meta director, but that's not relevant here. The point is, if the substituents on each ring are such that the ring has a plane of symmetry, then the overall molecule might not be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the central single bond connecting the two rings allows rotation, which would allow the substituents to be arranged in a way that creates chirality. But if the substituents are symmetrical, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the rings has two substituents which make some of their attached carbons chiral. Wait, the benzene ring carbons are sp² hybridized, so they're trigonal planar. So, they can't have four different groups because they have three bonds. So, the chiral centers can't be on the aromatic rings. So, looking elsewhere.

Are there any other chiral centers in the molecule? The ester groups: the carbonyl is O=C-OCH3. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The oxygen is attached to the carbon, but the other side is the benzene ring. So, the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the central connecting carbon? No, because it's a single bond between the two rings, so it's just connected to two benzene rings. That's two identical groups, so I don't think that's a chiral center.

So, if there are no chiral centers in the molecule, then it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. Or am I missing something?

Hmm, maybe I should move on and come back to this.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoate ester with the hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

The structure would be: the est
