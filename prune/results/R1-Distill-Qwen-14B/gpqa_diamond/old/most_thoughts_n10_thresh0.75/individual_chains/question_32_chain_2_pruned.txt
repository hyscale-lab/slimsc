Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, right, X is defined as Lithium with three neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons and varying neutrons. So Li with 3 neutrons would have an atomic number of 3 (Li), mass number 3 + 3 = 6, so it's Li-6. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think: protons are 3, neutrons are 3, so mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember from my physics classes that when dealing with particles moving at relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic equations. The energy of the particle is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes in these contexts, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Or wait, no, in colliders, the energy is typically the total energy. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

The question says, 'what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c.' So, the energy here is probably the total energy of the nucleus. Because in colliders, the particles are accelerated to a certain energy, which is their total energy. But sometimes, the problem might refer to kinetic energy. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: the formula for total energy is gamma * m0 cÂ². And
