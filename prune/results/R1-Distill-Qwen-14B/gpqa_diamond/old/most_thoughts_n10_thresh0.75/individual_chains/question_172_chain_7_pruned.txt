Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermal Equilibrium. Right, so I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy states is described by the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (kT), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So the formula is something like N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Oh wait, N2 is the higher energy level, right? So if E2 is higher than E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, making the exponent negative, which would mean N2 is less than N1 if T is positive.

In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think that means the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should clarify. Oh wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the number of excited atoms (in that specific energy level) is higher in star_1 than in star_2. So N1 (star_1) for that level is twice N2 (star_2). Or wait, maybe the ratio is N1/N2 = 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (N_upper in star 1) / (N_upper in star 2) ) = 2. Because the atoms are twice as excited in star_1 for that specific level. So that would imply that for star 1, the number in that level is higher.

So according to the Boltzmann equation, for each star, the ratio of the number in the excited state (N2) to the ground state (N1
