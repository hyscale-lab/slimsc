Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Oh wait, I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have even broader peaks because they're more acidic. But if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or an ether? No, ethers don't have O-H, so probably it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are higher frequencies. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower than 1700, so maybe an amide or conjugated carbonyl group.

Then, the 1H NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, so probably some kind of alkene or aromatic protons. Wait, but the options are all C6, so maybe it's a ring structure, like a cyclic compound. Or perhaps a diene or something else. The presence of vinyl protons suggests there's a double bond in the molecule.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, what's 45? Oh, that's the molecular ion for something like C3H7O, but wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether is 45, but wait, no, (CH3)2O is 45? Let's see: (12*2)+(6*2)+(16)= 24 +12 +16=52. Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 45 could be something else. Let me think: 45 is 3*15? Or maybe it's the molecular weight of another fragment. Hmm, another approach: common fragments in mass spec. Oh, the tropylium ion is m/z 91, so that's not it. Maybe it's a smaller fragment. Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion for ethanol (46, no). Wait, 45 is CH3CH2OH minus 1? No, ethanol is 46. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO is 44, no. Wait, 44 is CO2H? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me calculate. 45 is the sum of 12 for C, 8 for H (since 1*8=8), and 16 for O? Wait, 12 + 8 +16=36, no. Wait, wait, maybe 45 is C2H5O? No, C2H5O has a molecular weight of 12*2 +5 +16= 24+5+16=45. Oh yes! So that would be a fragment like ethoxy (OCH2CH3) or something similar. Or maybe a methyl group attached to something else, but that's probably stretching it.

Putting this together, let's look at the options:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

We need to figure out which one fits all the data.

First, the IR: the broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H. Then, strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a carbonyl. What about 1650? Maybe conjugated carbonyl, or possibly an aromatic ring with some substitution. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but the options don't include N, so probably not. 

The presence of a broad peak and a carbonyl suggests that maybe we have an ester. Because esters have both an O-H (wait, no, esters are O-C-O, so no O-H). Hmm, wait, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol. But if the compound is an ester, then the O-H is not present. Hmm, so perhaps it's a carboxylic acid? But carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch. Wait, but the other peak at 1650 could be the C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid, which is usually a bit lower than 1700 because of conjugation or hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester or ketone.

Wait, the two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. That makes me think of maybe two different carbonyl groups. Or perhaps one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is something else, like an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, benzene doesn't have a peak around 1650, but maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ket
