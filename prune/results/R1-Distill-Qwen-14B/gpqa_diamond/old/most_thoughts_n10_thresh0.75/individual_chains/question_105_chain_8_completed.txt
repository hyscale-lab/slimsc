Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is the same as the Sun's radius. Oh right, the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km, but maybe I don't need the exact number right now.

The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere. The filling factor is 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% coverage. But wait, it's only one hemisphere, so maybe that's not right. Wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered in spots—so actually, the entire hemisphere (50%) is covered, but the filling factor is 20%—no, wait, the question says the spots have a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. Because filling factor is the area covered. Oh, okay. So the spots are 20% of the star's surface.

The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So spots are 5000 K. That's a big difference.

The situation is that when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness variations. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would cause a dip in brightness. The question is, what radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star. So, essentially, what exoplanet radius Rpl would cause the same depth in the light curve as the spot-induced variations.

So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the transit depth is the same as the maximum dip due to the spots.

But wait, wait. How does the spot affect the light curve? When a spot is on the side facing us (the hemisphere facing us), it's cooler, so the star appears dimmer. When it's on the other side, it's not visible. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are all facing us, right? Or wait, no—since it's a hemisphere covered, but with a filling factor of 20%, maybe the spots are within that hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip.

But the key is to find the amplitude (the depth) of the variation. The transit depth caused by a planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. The spot effect would cause a dip equal to the area of the spots times their temperature difference, relative to the total flux.

So let's think about the flux. The star's total flux is what? The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

But when there are spots, part of the surface is cooler. The unspotted area is at 6000 K, and the spotted area is at 5000 K. The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the surface is spots. So 80% is normal.

So the total flux without any spots would be F0 = σTeff^4. Wait, no, actually, the flux per unit area is σT^4. So the total flux is the area times that. So F0 is (4πR²) * σ * (6000)^4.

With spots, the flux is F = (0.8 * 4πR² * σ * 6000^4) + (0.2 * 4πR² * σ *5000^4 ). 

But wait, actually, since the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR². So the spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 *4πR². But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The maximum dip occurs when all the spots are on the visible hemisphere. So the maximum dimming would be when the spots are facing us.

Wait no. Hmm, the star is observed from Earth, and as it rotates, the spots on the surface rotate into and out of view. The maximum dip occurs when the spot area is fully visible. So the dip in flux is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased: the star's brightness variation due to the spots has the same amplitude as a planet transit. So the dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible would be the maximum dip.

So the dip is (F0 - F_spots_visible) / F0.

Let me calculate F0 and F_spots_visible.

F0 = 4πR² σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are fully visible on the hemisphere facing us, the area of the spots is 0.2 *4πR² (because 20% filling factor). But wait—wait, no. The filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So if the star is viewed from Earth, and the spots are on the same hemisphere as the one facing us, then when the star rotates so that the spots are on the front, the area visible is 0.2*(4πR²). But wait, no, because in reality, the spots are on the surface, and when a spot is on the front, it's part of the disk. So the portion of the disk covered by spots is 20% of the entire star's surface. So the area of the spots visible during maximum dip is 0.2 * (π R²), since the area visible is a disk of radius R. Wait, no. Wait, when the star is viewed as a disk, the area is π R². So if the entire star's surface is 4π R², the visible area is π R². So if the spots cover 20% of the entire surface, then the area visible when the spots are on the front would be 20% of 4π R² multiplied by (the fraction of that which is in the visible hemisphere). Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the star's surface is a sphere of 4π R². The filling factor is the fraction of the entire surface covered by spots. So 20% of 4π R² is the area of the spots: 0.2 *4π R².

But when the star is viewed from Earth, only a hemisphere (2π R²) is visible. So when the spots are on the near side, the area of the spots visible is 0.2 *4π R² * (visible hemisphere area / total area) )? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the maximum number of spots visible would be half of the spots—since the spots are on the entire star, but when the star is viewed, only a hemisphere is visible. Wait, perhaps no. Let me think.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, regardless of which hemisphere we're looking at. So if the entire star has spots covering 20%, then when we view the star, the area of spots in our line of sight would be 20% of the area of the star's surface. But wait, the star's surface as we see it is a disk of area π R². The total surface area is 4π R². So if the spots are 20% of the entire surface, then the spots visible when the star is viewed edge-on or whatever would be 20% of 4π R², which is 0.8π R². So the area of the spots visible is 0.8π R². Hmm, wait, no. Wait, if the entire star has 0.2 *4π R² in spots, then the maximum area you can see from any viewing angle is 0.2 *4π R² * (π R² / 4π R²) )? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the maximum spot area visible. If the star has spots covering 20% of its entire surface, then the maximum that can be seen from Earth is when the spots are on the front hemisphere. So the area would be 20% of the front hemisphere, which is 20% of 2π R². So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the initial calculation for the flux when spots are visible would involve both the unspotted and spotted areas. So when the spots are on the front, the flux is F = (unspotted area) * σ T_unspotted^4 + (spotted area) * σ T_spotted^4.

The unspotted area is (front hemisphere area) - (spotted area on front). Front hemisphere area is 2π R². Spotted area on front is 0.2 *4π R² * (front area)/(total area) ). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the filling factor is 0.2 of the entire surface. So the front hemisphere has 2π R² area. The spots on the front are 0.2 *4π R² * (2π R² /4π R²) )= 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the front hemisphere has 2π R² area. Of that, 0.4 π R² is spots. So the unspotted area on front is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So flux when spots are visible is:

F_visible = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The total flux without any spots visible (F0) is when the entire front is at 6000 K. So F0 = 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the dip in flux is F0 - F_visible.

So dip = F0 - F_visible = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4 - [1.6 π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.4 π R² σ 5000^4 ].

Factor out common terms:

= 2 π R² σ 6000^4 - 1.6 π R² σ 6000^4 - 0.4 π R² σ 5000^4 

= (2 -1.6) π R² σ 6000^4 - 0.4 π R² σ 5000^4 

= 0.4 π R² σ 6000^4 - 0.4 π R² σ 5000^4 

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

So the dip is this value. The relative dip is dip / F0.

So dip/F0 = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 )] / [2 π R² σ 6000^4 ]

Simplify:

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2 *6000^4 ]

Let me compute this.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4. Let me compute 6000^4: 6^4 * 10^12 = 1296e12.

5000^4: 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = (1296 -625 )e12 = 671e12.

So back to the equation:

dip/F0 = 0.4 * 671e12 / (2 * 1296e12 )

The e12 cancels out. So:

= 0.4 * 671 / (2 * 1296 )

Calculate numerator: 0.4 * 671 = 268.4

Denominator: 2 *1296 = 2592

So fraction: 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035 or about 10.35%.

So the relative dip is about 10.35% when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but the question says that the photometric variations would be periodic and resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude is the same as the planet would produce.

For a planet, the transit depth is (Rpl / Rstar )^2.

We need to set this equal to the dip of 10.35% (0.1035).

So (Rpl / Rstar )^2 = 0.1035.

Take square root:

Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So about 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation steps.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spots are on the front, the dip is 10.35% of the star's normal flux, correct? So the planet would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 in the flux. So yes, equate that to 0.1035.

So Rpl/Rstar is square root of 0.1035, which is approximately 0.3217, so 0.32.

Looking at the options, D is ~0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the dip.

Wait, let me recheck the dip calculation.

Wait, F0 is the flux when all the star's surface is at 6000 K. But when we're looking at the front, the front is 2π R², but the total star's surface is 4π R². So the F0 is 4π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no, F0 is the total flux when the star is completely unspotted. But when we're considering the dip, the F_visible is the flux when the spots are in front. So perhaps my initial approach was incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the flux as a fraction of the total flux when the spots are visible. Hmm.

The total flux from the star when unspotted is F_total = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible on the front, the flux is F_visible = (4π R² - area of spots) * σ (6000)^4 + area of spots * σ (5000)^4.

But since the area of the spots is 0.2 *4π R², then F_visible = (4π R² - 0.2 *4π R²) σ 6000^4 + (0.2 *4π R²) σ 5000^4.

So F_visible = (0.8 *4π R²) σ 6000^4 + (0.2 *4π R²) σ 5000^4.

The dip is F_total - F_visible = (4π R² σ 6000^4) - [0.8 *4π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.2 *4π R² σ 5000^4 ]

= (0.2 *4π R² σ 6000^4) - (0.2 *4π R² σ 5000^4 )

Factor out 0.2 *4π R² σ:

= 0.2 *4π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

Then, the dip is (F_total - F_visible)/F_total = [0.2 *4π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4π R² σ 6000^4 ]

Simplify:

= 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Compute 6000^4 is 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 is 625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 671e12.

Thus,

dip = 0.2 *671e12 /1296e12 = 0.2 *671 /1296.

0.2 *671 = 134.2.

134.2 /1296 ≈ 0.1036, so about 10.36% dip.

So the dip is about 10.36% of the total flux.

So the transit depth caused by the exoplanet should be 10.36%, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.3219, which is approximately 0.32. So the answer is D.

Wait, but wait another thing. When the star is viewed, the area is π R². So when the spot is on the front, the area of the spot that is visible is 0.2 *4π R² * (π R²)/(4π R²)) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire spot area is 0.2 *4π R², so when looking at the front, the area of the spot visible is 0.2 *4π R² * (front area)/(total area) )? Hmm, no, perhaps not. Because the spots could be on any part of the star, but when the star is viewed, the spots on the back are not visible. So the maximum area visible is 0.2 *4π R² if all spots are on the front. But that's impossible because the front is 2π R², so 0.2 *4π R² is 0.8π R². Which is, wait, 0.8π R² is more than the front, which is π R². No, 0.8 π R² is 80% of π R², which is the front. So that's possible.

Wait, the front is π R² (since the star's radius is R, but the area is π R²). Hmm, no, wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². The area of a hemisphere is 2π R². No, wait, the area of a sphere is 4π R². The area of a spherical cap (hemisphere) is 2π R². So the front is 2π R².

So if the spots cover 0.2 of the entire surface (4π R²), then the maximum number of spots that can be visible is when the entire spot area is on the front. So the area of the spots visible is 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8π R².

So when the spots are fully visible, the flux is F_visible = (2π R² - 0.8π R²) * σ *6000^4 + 0.8π R² * σ *5000^4.

So F_visible = 1.2 π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.8 π R² σ 5000^4.

The F_total is 4 π R² σ 6000^4.

The dip is (F_total - F_visible)/F_total.

So F_total is 4 π R² σ 6000^4.

F_visible = 1.2 π R² σ6^4 + 0.8 π R² σ5^4.

So F_visible = π R² σ [1.2 *6^4 + 0.8 *5^4 ].

Compute 6^4 = 1296, 5^4=625.

1.2 *1296 = 1555.2, 0.8 *625 = 500.

So 1555.2 +500 = 2055.2.

F_visible = π R² σ 2055.2.

F_total =4 π R² σ 1296.

So dip = (4*1296 -2055.2 ) / (4*1296 ) * π R² σ.

Wait, no. Wait, dip is (F_total - F_visible) / F_total = [4π R² σ 1296 - π R² σ 2055.2 ] / [4π R² σ 1296].

Factor out π R² σ:

= [4*1296 -2055.2 ] / (4 *1296 )

Compute numerator: 4*1296 = 5184.

5184 -2055.2 = 3128.8.

So dip = 3128.8 / 5184 = approximately 0.5999, wait, wait no:

Wait, 4*1296 is 5184.

F_visible is π R² σ 2055.2.

So F_total is 4π R² σ 1296.

So F_total - F_visible = (4 *1296 -2055.2) π R² σ = (5184 -2055.2) = 3128.8 π R² σ.

So dip = 3128.8 / 5184 ≈ 0.603, so about 60% dip.

Wait, that can't be right. Because earlier I thought the dip was around 10%.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the flux as the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the fractional area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The approach I should take is:

The relative dip in brightness is (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted.

Wait, no. The dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotted_visible) / F_unspotted.

Wait, the star's total flux when unspotted is F0=4π R² σ T^4.

When spots are visible, the flux is F_vis = (4π R² - A_spots) σ T^4 + A_spots σ T_spot^4.

So F_vis = 4π R² σ T^4 - A_spots σ (T^4 - T_spot^4 ).

The dip is (F0 - F_vis)/F0 = [A_spots σ (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [4π R² σ T^4 ]

Simplify:

= [A_spots (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [4π R² T^4 ]

But A_spots is the area of the spots, which is filling factor * 4π R².

So A_spots = f *4π R², with f=0.2.

So dip = [ f *4π R² (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [4π R² T^4 ]

Simplify:

= f (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T^4.

So dip = f * (1 - (T_spot / T )^4 )

Given f=0.2, T=6000, T_spot=5000.

Compute (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 =5/6≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 *0.51775 = 0.10355.

So dip ≈10.355% of F0.

So the relative dip is about 10.355%.

The planet's transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Set that equal to 0.10355: (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈0.3218.

So about 0.32, which is option D.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the dip in brightness caused by the spots and equate it to the transit depth caused by the planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Filling factor of spots: \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Spots temperature: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Calculation**:
   - The total flux of the unspotted star is:
     \[
     F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - When spots are fully visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{visible}} = (1 - f) \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
   - The dip in flux is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_0 - F_{\text{visible}}
     \]
   - Substituting the flux expressions:
     \[
     \Delta F = f \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)
     \]

3. **Relative Dip**:
   - The relative dip is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.4823 \). Thus:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 = 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Transit Depth**:
   - The transit depth caused by an exoplanet is:
     \[
     \text{Transit Depth} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - Set the transit depth equal to the relative dip:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
