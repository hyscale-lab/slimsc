Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are when this is treated with Grubbs. Let me think.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Oh right, metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? It typically leads to the redistribution of alkylidene groups between the reacting alkenes.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers, so the molecule has a chiral center. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on C3.

So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₂? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂. But with a methyl on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. So the full structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has five carbons, so positions 1 to 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. The methyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because that would be four carbons after the double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? No, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurately CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, because that's six carbons. Wait, no, wait. Let me count again. For pent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So adding a methyl group on the third carbon makes it CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons in total. Yes, because
