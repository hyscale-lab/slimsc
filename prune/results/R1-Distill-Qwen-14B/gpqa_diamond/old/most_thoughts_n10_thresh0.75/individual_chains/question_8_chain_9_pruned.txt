Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about gene interactions in plants related to disease resistance. Let me read through the question carefully and make sure I understand what's going on.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment with white lupine plants to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They knocked out each gene, creating mutants g1, g2, g3. Then they also made double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. 

The key information is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of another gene or genes. So, transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. That suggests that the activity of other genes might depend on the transcription factor.

They tested these mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. The results are as follows:

- g1: 75% resistance (so 25% less than wild type)
- g2: 0% (total loss of resistance)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, so the single mutants each have different levels of resistance. The double mutants have even lower or same as each single. 

The question is about what conclusion we can draw regarding the interaction among these genes. The options are A, B, C, D, each suggesting different relationships between the genes, like which is a transcription factor, if there's pleiotropy, or gene redundancy, and which genes are epistatic to others.

Remember, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. In other words, if gene B is epistatic to gene A, then the phenotype of gene A's mutation depends on the presence of gene B. So when gene B is mutated, the phenotype of A's mutation might be hidden or altered.

Also, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Alternatively, gene redundancy is when two or more genes can perform the same function, so knocking out both can have a more severe effect than either alone.

Let me think about the results step by step.

First, the single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So it's less than wild type but not completely gone. Maybe G1 contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor. Perhaps it's a transcription factor that upregulates other genes, so knocking it out reduces their expression, leading to lower resistance. Alternatively, G1 could be part of a redundant system.
- g2 has 0% resistance. That's a complete loss. So G2's function is critical. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it activates other genes necessary for resistance. Without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, so the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3 has 50% resistance. So it's half as resistant as wild type. Maybe G3 contributes to resistance but isn't as essential as G2.

Now the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Both mutations together cause complete loss. But wait, g2 alone is already 0%. So why is g1g2 also 0%? Maybe because g1 mutation doesn't contribute anything on its own when g2 is already knocked out. But why would the double mutant be worse than either single? Or perhaps, in this case, since g2 alone already gives 0%, any combination with it would also give 0%.

Wait, but that's not true for all the double mutants. Let's check the others.
