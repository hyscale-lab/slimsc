Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting, same factor. Then, through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, that probably relates to their temperatures, right? Because the peak wavelength of a black body is determined by its temperature. The formula I remember is Wien's law: lambda_max * T = constant. So if the peaks are the same, the temperatures must be the same? Wait, is that correct? Because Wien's displacement law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So if lambda_max is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature. Got it.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but since the question is about their actual luminosities, maybe the radial velocity is a distractor here? Because the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So radial velocity might not affect the intrinsic luminosity, which depends on radius and temperature. So perhaps the radial velocity info is extra or for a different part of the problem.

Wait, the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of ..." So the question is about the ratio of their luminosities.

Luminosity for a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both are black bodies, this should apply.

Given that, let's plug in the numbers. Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. R1 = 1.5 R2. And we established that T1 = T2 because lambda_max is same. So T1 = T2.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2)² * T² ) / ( R2² * T² ) ) = ( (2.25 R2²) * T² ) / ( R2² T² ) ) → The R² and T terms cancel out, so L1/L2 = (2.25) / 1 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25.

Wait, but wait a second. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So the first option is choice A.

But wait, did I miss anything? The problem mentions the radial velocities. The velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that affect luminosity? Hmm, wait, no. The luminosity here is intrinsic, as per the problem statement. The stars are radiating as black bodies, so the observed flux would be affected by distance and any Doppler effects, but the problem is about their computed luminosities. So the radial velocities, which affect the observed wavelength (due to Doppler shift), but since the peak wavelengths are the same, that's already accounted for in the temperature. So perhaps the velocities don't directly affect the luminosity computation here.

Wait, unless the radial velocities affect the observed temperature, but no, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same, which would imply that the actual temperatures are the same. Because any Doppler shift would alter the observed wavelength. Wait, but if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted. So the peak wavelength would be shorter than the rest wavelength. Conversely, a star moving away would have a longer peak wavelength.

But here, the observed lambda_max is the same for
