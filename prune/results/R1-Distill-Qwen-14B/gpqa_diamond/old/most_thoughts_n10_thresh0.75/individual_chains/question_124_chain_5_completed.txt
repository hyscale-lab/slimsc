Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking: What Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls?

Hmm. So I think the key here is to figure out how the Lorentz factor relates to the number of particles that reach the detector. Let me think about what I know about Lorentz factors and their effects on particle decay and travel time.

Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At ultra-relativistic speeds, gamma is much larger than 1. Gamma affects time dilation and length contraction. But how does this relate to the particles reaching the detector?

Wait, the particles are fast-decaying, so they have a short lifetime. The distance they can travel before decaying depends on their speed. If their lifetime is dilated due to high gamma, they can travel further before decaying.

So, the problem must relate to the particles' decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. It's given by c * tau * gamma, where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame).

In the initial scenario, one third reach the detector. So the decay length must be such that only 1/3 of them make it 30 meters. When we increase the Lorentz factor gamma, the decay length increases because it's proportional to gamma. So with higher gamma, more particles would reach the detector.

Wait, the initial gamma is 20, and only 1/3 reach the wall. We need to find a gamma where 2/3 reach the wall. So higher gamma would mean longer decay length, which allows more particles to make it to the detector's radius.

So let's model this.

First, let's think of the decay length as L = c * tau * gamma.

In the initial case, when gamma is 20, the decay length L1 = c tau * 20.

But only one third of the particles reach the detector's wall, which is 30 meters away. So that implies that the decay length L1 is 30 meters * 3 = 90 meters? Because only 1/3 make it, meaning that on average, the particles that decay within 30 meters are 1/3 of them. Or wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of probability.

Wait, the number of particles that reach the detector depends on the decay probability. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance x is given by the exponential decay law: P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/(c tau gamma)). But wait, actually, the probability that a particle has decayed by distance x is P = 1 - e^(-x/(c tau gamma)). So the probability that it hasn't decayed by x is e^(-x/(c tau gamma)).

Wait, no. Wait, the decay probability is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/(L)), where L is the decay length. So for the detector at radius R=30m, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed (so it reaches the detector) is e^(-R/(c tau gamma)).

In the initial case, with gamma=20, the probability that a particle reaches the detector is one third. So:

P_initial = e^(-30/(c tau * 20)) = 1/3.

Let me write that as equation:

e^(-30/(c tau * 20)) = 1/3.

Take natural log of both sides:

-30/(c tau * 20) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3).

Multiply both sides by -1:

30/(c tau *20) = ln(3).

So,

c tau = 30 / (20 * ln(3)).

Wait, but let's compute this. Let me compute ln(3) which is approximately 1.0986.

So c tau = 30/(20 * 1.0986) = 30/(21.972) ≈ 1.363 m.

Hmm, okay, so c tau is about 1.363 meters.

Now, the question is, what gamma do we need so that the probability P_new = 2/3.

So,

e^(-30/(c tau * gamma_new)) = 2/3.

Take ln of both sides:

-30/(c tau gamma_new) = ln(2/3) ≈ ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055.

Multiply both sides by -1:

30/(c tau gamma_new) = 0.4055.

We can substitute c tau from the initial condition. Since c tau = 30/(20 * ln(3)).

So,

30 / ( (30/(20 ln3)) * gamma_new ) ) = 0.4055.

Let me simplify this.

30 divided by (30/(20 ln3)* gamma_new) ) equals 30 * (20 ln3) / (30 gamma_new )) = (20 ln3)/gamma_new.

Set equal to 0.4055:

(20 ln3) / gamma_new = 0.4055.

Solve for gamma_new:

gamma_new = (20 ln3) / 0.4055.

Compute ln3 again: about 1.0986.

So,

gamma_new ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ (21.972) / 0.4055 ≈ approximately 54.13.

So gamma_new is about 54.13, which is close to option A) 54.

Wait, but wait: the way I modeled it, when gamma increases, the decay length increases, so the exponent becomes smaller, and the probability of reaching the detector increases. So yes, higher gamma would lead to more particles reaching the detector.

Wait, but the initial condition was gamma=20, and 1/3 reach the detector. Now, we're looking for gamma_new where 2/3 reach the detector. So gamma_new is larger than 20, so the options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

So the calculation gives around 54, so option A is the answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Let me compute (20 * ln3)/0.4055.

Compute 20 * 1.0986 = 21.972.

21.972 divided by 0.4055: let's compute it.

0.4055 times 54 is 21.9435. Because 54 *0.4=21.6, 54 *0.0055=0.297, so 21.6+0.297=21.897. Hmm, 54*0.4055=54*(0.4+0.0055)=54*0.4=21.6, 54*0.0055=0.297 → total 21.897. So 21.897 is 0.075 less than 21.972. So 54*0.4055=21.897, which is about 0.075 less than 21.972. So 21.972 /0.4055=54 + 0.075/0.4055≈54.18. So about 54.18, so 54 is correct.

So the answer is A)54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, particle decay, and the detector's radius.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decay Length and Probability**:  
   The decay length of a particle is given by \( L = c \tau \gamma \), where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime, and \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. The probability that a particle reaches the detector's inner wall (radius \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \)) is \( P = e^{-R / (c \tau \gamma)} \).

2. **Initial Condition**:  
   At \( \gamma = 20 \), only one-third of the particles reach the detector, meaning \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1/3 \). Using the decay probability formula:
   \[
   e^{-30 / (c \tau \cdot 20)} = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm:
   \[
   -\frac{30}{c \tau \cdot 20} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3).
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{30}{c \tau \cdot 20} = \ln(3).
   \]
   Solving for \( c \tau \):
   \[
   c \tau = \frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)}.
   \]
   Using \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \):
   \[
   c \tau \approx \frac{30}{20 \cdot 1.0986} \approx 1.363 \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **New Condition**:  
   We need \( P_{\text{new}} = 2/3 \), meaning:
   \[
   e^{-30 / (c \tau \cdot \gamma_{\text{new}})} = \frac{2}{3}.
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm:
   \[
   -\frac{30}{c \tau \cdot \gamma_{\text{new}}} = \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{30}{c \tau \cdot \gamma_{\text{new}}} = 0.4055.
   \]
   Substituting \( c \tau \approx 1.363 \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   \frac{30}{1.363 \cdot \gamma_{\text{new}}} = 0.4055.
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):
   \[
   \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{30}{1.363 \cdot 0.4055} \approx \frac{30}{0.553} \approx 54.13.
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \approx 54 \). Among the given options, the closest value is **A) 54**.
