Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

So the problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. 

Wait, I remember that each orbital angular momentum quantum number l is associated with the p orbital, which has l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, which is the sum of l1 and l2. And m is the magnetic quantum number, which is -1 here.

The question is about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. L1z and L2z are the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron. I need to find the probability that both are -ħ when measured.

I think I remember that for angular momentum, the z-component eigenvalues are given by mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, L1z has eigenvalues m1 * ħ, and L2z has m2 * ħ. Here, m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, or 1 for each p orbital.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. But how does this relate to the individual m1 and m2?

In coupled angular momentum states, the state is expressed as a combination of states where m1 + m2 = m_total. In this case, m_total is -1. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are (-1,0), (0,-1). Wait, or is there another? Let me see. Oh, because m can range from -l to +l in integer steps. So for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible pairs adding to -1:

- (-1, 0) → sum is -1
- (0, -1) → sum is -1
- Also, any others? Like (-2, 1) but wait, m1 and m2 each can only be -1, 0, 1. So no, only those two possibilities.

Wait, but the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So this is a state where the total angular momentum is l=2 and m=-1. How does this state break down into the possible m1 and m2 combinations?

I think the coupled state |l1,l2,l,m> can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states |m1>|m2>, where m1 + m2 = m. So here, the state is |1,1,2,-1>, which would be a combination of the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1.

But wait, since the total m is -1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state is a sum of these two product states.

But wait, another thing: when combining two angular momenta, the coupling can be done in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1,l2,l,m> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m.

But in this case, l1 and l2 are both 1, and l is 2. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two p orbitals (l=1 each) into l=2.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, and m=-1.

I think when l=2, m can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. But in our case, it's m=-1.

The state |1,1,2,-1> should be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So for l1=1, m1 can be -1, 0, 1; same for l2. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs adding to -1 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → product |m1= -1> |m2=0>
m1=0, m2=-1 → product |m1=0> |m2=-1>

Wait, but also, is there any other combination? No, because m1 can't be less than -1 here. So the state is a linear combination of these two product states.

But what are the coefficients? The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2, m=-1:

The general formula is:

|l1, l2, l, m> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | l, m> ] |m1, m2>

In our case, l=2, m=-1, l1=1, l2=1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case are sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3), I think. Wait, let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the state m=-1 of total l=2.

Wait, the coefficients for l=2, m=2: only m1=1, m2=1.

For m=1: m1=1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=1. The coefficients are sqrt( (1)(2) / ( (2)(3) ) ) ) Hmm, no, maybe I should think in terms of the explicit values.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1 → l=2.

The states for l=2, m=2: (1,1)
m=1: (1,0) and (0,1) with coefficients sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3). Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I think the coefficients for m=-1 would be the same as for m=1 but with signs.
