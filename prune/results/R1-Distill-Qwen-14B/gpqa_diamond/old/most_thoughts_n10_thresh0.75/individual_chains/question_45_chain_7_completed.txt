Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The energy E is given as E = pi²ħ²/(2mL²), which I remember is the ground state energy for a single particle in such a well.

Hmm, wait—since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers. But since they are spin-1/2, each has spin up or down. So each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins.

So, each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. For a single particle, energy En = (n²)E, right? Because E scales with n squared. So for n=1, E; n=2, 4E; n=3, 9E; and so on.

But since we have four identical particles, we need to fill up the energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion. Let's think about how the quantum states are filled.

In a 1D infinite potential well, each state is characterized by the principal quantum number n. Each n has a certain energy. But for fermions, each n can have two particles (spin up and spin down).

So, the ground state would have the lowest possible energy. The lowest n is 1, which can hold two particles. Then, the next n is 2: that's another two particles. Because we have four particles in total, n=1 and n=2 will each hold two particles. So each of these n levels can hold two particles.

Wait, wait. So the ground state is when each of the first two energy levels is filled with two particles each. So the energies would be 1²E and 2²E, each with two particles.

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The particles are fermions, so each can occupy the same n but different spin states. So the first two particles go into n=1 (spin up and down). The third and fourth would go into n=2, each taking a spin state. So all four are filled in the lowest two energy levels.

So for the ground state, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each particle. Each in n=1 or n=2? Wait no, no. Wait, no. Wait, if all four are in the lowest possible states, then two are in n=1 and two are in n=2.

So the energies would be two particles at E (n=1) and two at 4E (n=2). So total energy would be 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, each n can hold two particles. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two into n=2. So each level is filled with two particles. So the energies would be (each with n=1 gives E, each with n=2 gives 4E). So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The system is four particles in the well. Each n can have two fermions. So for the ground state, the lowest possible arrangement is n=1 filled with two (each with opposite spin) and n=2 filled with two (each with opposite spin). So each of the four particles is in either n=1 or n=2.

So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but is that correct? Because each of the two particles in n=1 contributes E each. So for two particles, it's 2E. Similarly, two particles in n=2 contribute 4E each, so 8E. So total is 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Now, what's the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible state after the ground state. So in the ground state, we've filled n=1 and n=2. The next available state is n=3, which can hold two particles.

So for first excited state, perhaps one of the particles is promoted to n=3. But wait, the particles are indistinct. So the first excited state would have two particles in n=3? No, because each n can hold two. Wait, but if in ground state, n=1 has two, n=2 has two. So to get the first excited state, perhaps one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the first excited state is when the highest n is increased. Let me think about how the particles are arranged.

In the ground state:

n=1: two particles (say, spin up and down)

n=2: two particles (spin up and down)

So all four are filled in the lowest possible states.

The first excited state would have the next possible configuration. But since all lower states are filled, the next available is n=3. So we have to add a particle to n=3, but wait, we already have four particles. Oh, no, wait. No, the particles can't be added; they are already placed. So perhaps in the first excited state, the configuration is that one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. Since we can't have more particles, but the arrangement changes.

Wait, no. Let's think about the order of filling. For fermions, the order is by increasing energy. So the ground state is filled up to n=2, with two particles each. Now, the first excited state would be when the highest occupied state is n=3. But how?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when all four are in n=1 and n=2, but with a different spin arrangement. No, because spin is already considered. Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the particles filling the lowest possible energy levels, but considering that each state can hold two particles (with spin up and down). So for four particles, the ground state is n=1 with two, n=2 with two. So the next state would be to have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Because you can't have more than two in a single n. So the first excited state would have the configuration (n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1). So the energies would be 2E (n=1, two particles), 4E (n=2, one), and 9E (n=3, one). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E = 15E. So the first excited state energy would be 15E.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because to get the first excited state, you promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. But since each n can have two, perhaps you can have two in n=3. But wait, we have four particles. So in ground state, two in 1, two in 2. First excited state would have the next possible arrangement—maybe two in 1, one in 2, and one in 3. Is that the first excited state?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest occupied state is n=3, but with two particles in n=3. But how? Because total particles would be 2 (n=1) + 2 (n=3) =4. So that would be another possible configuration. So does that make the total energy 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E? But wait, that's higher than the previous case.

Wait, but which is the correct order? Let's think about the possible states:

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Energy = 10E.

First excited state: could be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Energy= 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Alternatively, another possibility is n=1 (2), n=3 (2), which would have energy 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. So which of these is lower in energy? 15E is lower than 20E, so the first excited state would be the one with 15E.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the arrangement where you have one in n=2 and one in n=3 is the first excited state, because that's the next possible state. But I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the possible orderings.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest n is 3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy would be 2E + 4E +9E = 15E.

Wait, but another way: the ground state is the lowest possible total energy. The first excited state would be the next lowest possible total energy. So the arrangement where as many as possible particles are in the lower energy states, but one is promoted to the next higher state.

So the first excited state would have three particles in n=1 (but no, each n can have only two), so that's not possible. So the next is two in n=1, two in n=2. Wait, that's the ground state. So then, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

So then, the total energy would be 2E (n=1 two particles) + 4E (n=2 one) + 9E (n=3 one) = 15E. So the first excited state is 15E.

Now, what about the second excited state? Let's think. After the first excited state, the next state would be when another particle is promoted to a higher n. So perhaps in the second excited state, we have two in n=1, two in n=3. Because that would be the next possible arrangement. So two particles in each of n=1, n=3. So their energies are 2E (n=1) and 2*(9E) =18E. So total energy 2E + 18E =20E.

Wait, but wait another possibility: perhaps the second excited state could have two in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. No, because each n can hold only two. Wait, no, if you have two in n=1, two in n=3, that's four particles. So the second excited state would have 20E.

Wait, but let me think again. The next state after first excited state (15E) would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So n=2 has one, n=3 has two. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3. Wait, but that's 5 particles. Oh no, wait, four particles. So that's not possible. Because n=3 can have two, but n=2 can only have one at this point.

Wait, no, when we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, that's four. If another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 will have zero, but n=3 will have two. So configuration becomes two in n=1, two in n=3. So that's four particles. So the total energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =20E.

But let me think about the order. The possible states in order of increasing energy would be:

1. Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2): 10E.

2. First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): 15E.

3. Second excited state: n=1 (2), n=3 (2): 20E.

So then, the options given in the problem are:

Options:
A) 30E, 39E, 50E
B) 4E, 10E, 50E
C) 4E, 10E, 15E
D) 10E, 15E, 18E

Wait, but according to my calculation, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But none of the options have 20E. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the energies. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, each particle's energy is En = n²E. So n=1 is E, n=2 is 4E, n=3 is 9E, n=4 is 16E, etc.

Wait, in the ground state, two in n=1, two in n=2. So energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E. So that's correct.

First excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E. That's correct.

Second excited state: two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E. But none of the options have 20E. So I must be missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E. So the second excited state in option D is 18E. Hmm, 18E would be if the configuration was two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Because 2E +4E +16E=22E. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, 18E is 2E (from two particles in n=1) plus 16E (two particles in n=4?), but no, that would be 2E + 2*(16E)=34E. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the ground state. Because wait, for four particles, perhaps the ground state is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are not fermions but bosons? No, the question states spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the ground state is incorrect. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles. So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2, with two each. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, then the first excited state is the next possible arrangement, which is two in n=1, two in n=3. Because when you promote two particles from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but wait, because each n can only hold two particles. So in the ground state, two in n=1, two in n=2. First excited state would involve the next available energy level, which is n=3. So how?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. But in that case, n=2 would have one, and n=3 would have one. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E. So that's the first excited state.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 or n=3. But n=2 is only holding one, so perhaps another is promoted to n=3. So now, n=3 has two. So configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E.

But again, the options don't include 20E. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the first excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, but that would take four particles. No, that's not possible because each n can only hold two. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Then the second excited state is when another particle is promoted from n=3 to n=4. So configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. So the energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and two in n=4. So energy is 2E + 2*(16E) =34E. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should think in terms of the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers.

Wait, each particle has a different set of quantum numbers, so their individual energies are En = n² E. The total energy is the sum of all individual energies.

In the ground state, the four particles would have the lowest possible n's such that no two have the same n, considering their spins. Wait, no, because each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So each n can have two particles.

So the four particles would be in n=1 (two), n=2 (two). So the energies are 1²E, 1²E, 2²E, 2²E. So sum is 2*(1² + 2²) E = 2*(1 +4) E =10E.

First excited state: The next possible arrangement would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So the energies are 1²,1², 2²,3². Sum is 1+1+4+9=15; 15E.

Second excited state: Now, perhaps the next step is to have two in n=1, two in n=3. So energies 1²,1²,3²,3². Sum is 1+1+9+9=20E.

Wait, but the options don't have 20E. Let me see the options again.

Option D says 10E, 15E, 18E.

Hmm, 18E would correspond to what? 18=1 +4 +9 +4? No, that doesn't add up. Or maybe 1 + 1 + 4 +16=22E. Not 18.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the first excited state is 15E and the second is 20E. But the options don't have that.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps each state can have a maximum of two particles, and the ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Which gives 10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So energies sum to 1+1+4+9=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=3. So now, two in n=1, two in n=3. So energies sum to 1+1+9+9=20E.

But again, no option matches this.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

Hmm. 18E would be the sum of two in n=1 and one each in n=2 and n=4: 1+1+4+16=22E. No. Or perhaps another configuration. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when three particles are in n=1, but that's not possible because each n can hold two particles. So perhaps the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, how could that happen? Let me think. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4.

Wait, 1+1+9+16=27E. That's not 18E.

Hmm, perhaps the ordering is different. Maybe the first excited state is 4E, which would be if only two particles are in n=2 and the rest in higher states. But no, the four particles would be in the lowest possible states.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think: the particles are spin-1/2, so each n can have two particles. The energies are En = n²E.

For four particles, the ground state is when all are in the lowest possible states.

So, n=1: two particles (E each)
n=2: two particles (4E each)
Total energy = 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

So ground state is 10E. So that's correct.

Now, the first excited state would have the next possible lowest energy. That would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3.

So now, n=1: two
n=2: one
n=3: one

Total energy: 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) = 15E.

So first excited state is 15E.

Now, the second excited state: the next possible promotion. So perhaps another particle is promoted to n=3. Now n=3 has two, n=2 has zero.

So n=1: two
n=3: two

Energy: 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E.

Hmm, 18E is the sum of 2E (two in n=1) plus 16E (one in n=4). Because 2 +16=18. But wait, that would mean one particle in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=4. No, that's five particles. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4, but that's higher energy.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So total energy is 15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3. So two in n=3; energy is 20E. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. But that would make the first excited state 20E, which is higher than the previous 15E. That can't be.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible options and see which one fits.

Looking at the options, option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How could 18E come about? Let's see: 18E would be sum of 1²E, 1²E, 2²E, and 4²E. Because 1+1+4+16=22. No.

Wait, 18E would be 9E * 2, implying two particles in n=3. So 2 *9E =18E. But that can't be because in that case, the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. Which gives total energy 2E + 18E=20E. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. Let's think: in ground state, four particles: two in n=1, two in n=2 (10E).

First excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E).

Second excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. So energies are 1+1+4+16=22E. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. No, that would be higher.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each excited state is determined by the maximum n. So ground state has maximum n=2. First excited state has maximum n=3. Second excited state has maximum n=4.

So for maximum n=3: two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E.

But no option has 20E. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the maximum n=3, but only one particle in it. So the sum is 15E.

The second excited state would then have maximum n=4, so one particle in n=4. So total energy would be 10E (ground) + (sum for excited) = 10E + (16E) =26E. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the sum being the sum of four different n's, but that can't be because with four particles, you can have two in n=1 and two in n=2 in the ground state, and then promotions to higher n's.

I'm really stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ground 10E, first 15E, second 18E.

Hmm, 18E could be the sum of two in n=1 and one each in n=2 and n=4. Let's calculate: 1+1+4+16=22E. Not 18.

Alternatively, 1+1+9+7 (but 7 isn't a square). No.

Wait, 18E is 2*9E. So perhaps two particles are in n=3. So two in n=1, two in n=3. So sum is 2E + 2*9E=20E. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=4 (one). Sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Hmm, again, no.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2, another in n=3, and the others in n=1. So sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E. But that's the first excited state.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me think about the possible options and see which one makes sense.

Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, 18E is 9E*2. So two particles in n=3. So configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 18E=20E. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So sum is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others are in n=1 and n=2. So sum is 15E. Second excited state could be when another particle is promoted to n=3, so two in n=3. So sum is 2E + 2*(9E)=20E.

But again, no option for that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E. Let me think again. Because each n can have two particles, the four particles would be in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), so sum is 2E +2*(4E)=10E.

So ground state is 10E.

First excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, so n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one. Sum is 15E.

Second excited state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, so now n=3 has two. So sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But again, no option has 20E.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the second excited state isn't about promoting the next particle but about a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (two), n=3 (two). So energy 2E + 18E=20E. But that isn't an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ground state is when the four particles are all in the same n. But no, because each n can hold only two particles. So that's impossible. So ground state must have n=1 (two) and n=2 (two).

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, but another is promoted to n=4 as well. But that would make the sum higher.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So sum is 2E (n=1 two) + 18E (n=3 two). So 20E. But that would make the second excited state higher.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the individual energies, not the total. No, the question says the energy of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are placed in the well in such a way that they don't all have to be in the lowest possible n. But that's not right; they are fermions, so they will occupy the lowest possible states.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one), which gives 15E.

The second excited state could be when one particle is in n=4, and others are arranged as n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=4 (one). So sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So sum is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. No match.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible options. The only option that has the ground state as 10E is option D and option B. Option B's first excited state is 10E, which can't be. So option D is the only one compatible.

But according to my calculations, the second excited state is 20E, which is not in option D. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about fermions. Oh no, no, the question says spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are not filled in the way I thought. Maybe the order is different. For four particles, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=2. But I'm not seeing how that works.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So 2E + 2*(9E)=20E. Then the second excited state would be when two are in n=4 and two in n=1: 2E + 2*(16E)=34E. But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3, sum 18E. But that would require two in n=1 and two in n=3, which would be 2E+18E=20E. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 4E, which would correspond to two particles in n=2 and two particles in n=3. No, that would be higher than ground state.

Hmm. I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Perhaps the four particles are arranged such that their quantum numbers are n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2. So ground state: 1,1,2,2: sum 2E + 8E=10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So particles are 1,1,2,3. Sum 1+1+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, so particles are 1,1,3,3. Sum 1+1+9+9=20E.

But again, no option for 20E. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that can't be.

Wait, looking again at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So 18E would be the sum of 1+1+16=18? No, that's three particles. Alternatively, 9*2=18E. So two particles in n=3.

So configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. So sum is 2E + 18E=20E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is two in n=2 and two in n=3. So sum is 8E +18E=26E.

But none of the options have that.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should select option D because it's the only one that starts with 10E, and the first excited is 15E, which I calculated correctly. But the second excited in option D is 18E, which I can't reconcile.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So sum is 2E (n=1 two) +4E (n=2 one) +16E (n=4 one) =22E. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (two), n=3 (one), and n=4 (one). Sum is 2E +9E +16E=27E. No match.

I'm really not sure. I think I'll have to go with my initial calculations and see which option fits. The ground state is 10E, first excited 15E. The only option with that is option D, which has 10E,15E,18E.

But why 18E? I don't know. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and another in n=3. So sum is 1+1+4+16=22E. No. Or perhaps two in n=3, sum 2*9E=18E, but that would require two in n=3 and two in n=1. So 20E.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should just conclude that the correct option is D, since the first two match my calculations, and perhaps the second excited state is the sum of two particles in n=3 and two in n=1, which is 20E. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, and the other three are in lower states. So sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=4 and two in n=1. So sum is 2E + 2*16E=34E. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and another in n=3. So sum is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

No. Hmm. I think I've tried all possibilities. Maybe the correct answer is option D, even though I can't see how the second excited state is 18E. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the particles are bosons, but no, the problem states spin-1/2, which are fermions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energies are calculated as the sum of individual energies, but multiplied by some factor due to their indistinguishability. But no, that's not how it works.

I think I'll have to go with option D, since the ground and first excited states match my calculations, and perhaps the second excited state is 18E in some way I can't see right now.


The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length \( L \), with the energy of a single particle given as \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of its particles, where the energy of a particle in the \( n \)-th quantum state is \( E_n = n^2 E \). Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, each quantum state \( n \) can hold at most two particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).

### Ground State:
In the ground state, the four particles occupy the lowest available quantum states. Since each state \( n \) can hold two particles, the configuration is:
- Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (energies \( E \) each),
- Two particles in \( n = 2 \) (energies \( 4E \) each).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (energies \( E \) each),
- One particle in \( n = 2 \) (energy \( 4E \)),
- One particle in \( n = 3 \) (energy \( 9E \)).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) or \( n = 3 \) to the next available state. The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (energies \( E \) each),
- Two particles in \( n = 3 \) (energies \( 9E \) each).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** \( 30E, 39E, 50E \) — These values are much higher than the calculated energies and do not match.
- **Option B:** \( 4E, 10E, 50E \) — The ground state energy \( 10E \) matches, but the first excited state \( 4E \) is incorrect.
- **Option C:** \( 4E, 10E, 15E \) — The ground state \( 10E \) and first excited state \( 15E \) match, but the second excited state \( 4E \) is incorrect.
- **Option D:** \( 10E, 15E, 18E \) — The ground state \( 10E \) and first excited state \( 15E \) match, but the second excited state \( 18E \) does not align with the calculated \( 20E \). However, this is the closest match to the calculated values.

### Conclusion:
While the calculated second excited state energy is \( 20E \), none of the options provide this value. Based on the given options, **Option D** is the most consistent with the calculated ground and first excited state energies.
