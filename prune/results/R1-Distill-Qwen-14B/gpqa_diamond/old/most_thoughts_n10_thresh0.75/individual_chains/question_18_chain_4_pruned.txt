Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here because the question is about elemental abundances, which I think are more about the composition than the mass. So maybe I can ignore the masses for now.

The given data are the elemental abundances using the EW method, assuming LTE. The values given are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere has:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, it's [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2]?

Wait, no. The ratio of silicon atoms would be (n_Si, Star_1) / (n_Si, Star_2), I think. Or maybe the ratio of their abundances relative to another element, but the question is about the actual ratio of Si atoms between the two stars.

Wait, the problem says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So, that's (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = ?

But to find that, I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio.

Wait, because if [X/H] is the logarithm of (n_X / n_H) relative to solar, then for each star, their [Si/H] would be based on their [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe], right?

Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's get the Sun's abundances.

For the Sun:

log(nFe/nH) = 7.5
