Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. It says that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, all involving some formula with constants k, q, d, R, and some combination of squares.

Alright, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves interactions between charges. Since the sphere is conducting, the charge will redistribute. Oh wait, when a conductor is grounded, it can allow charges to flow in or out until the charge on the conductor is such that the electric potential is zero, but waitâ€”no, no, the conductor itself is neutral unless there's an external charge inducing some redistribution.

Wait, when you bring a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor's charges will respond. So in this case, the conducting sphere is initially neutral. When charge q is placed near it, the charges in the sphere will redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move in or out to maintain the potential at the sphere's surface as zero. But wait, I think the presence of the external charge q will induce a charge on the sphere. 

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. So here, we have the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the system's potential energy would be the work done in bringing the charge q to the point d away from the sphere's center, plus the work done in assembling the induced charges on the sphere. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe think about the method of images. When a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, you can model it using image charges. The conducting sphere is grounded, so the potential at the surface is zero. For a conducting sphere, the image charge method says that the induced charge on the sphere is such that the potential is the same as the sphere's potential, which is zero here.

Hmm, another angle: When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, it induces a charge -q' on the sphere such that the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges is zero at the sphere's surface. Wait, no, perhaps the image charge concept can help here. For a sphere, the image charge q' would be located along the line connecting the charge q and the center of the sphere. The image charge's position and magnitude are determined so that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as it would be due to the external charge alone.

Wait, right, the image charge method for a conducting sphere. When you have a charge q outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is placed at a distance from the center such that the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface is zero. Wait, no, the sphere is a conductor, so its surface must be an equipotential. The external charge q would create a potential, and the sphere's induced charges adjust so that the total potential is zero on the surface because the sphere is grounded.

Wait, no, correction: The conducting sphere's surface is an equipotential. If it's grounded, the potential is set to zero. So the potential at the sphere's surface due to the external charge q and the
