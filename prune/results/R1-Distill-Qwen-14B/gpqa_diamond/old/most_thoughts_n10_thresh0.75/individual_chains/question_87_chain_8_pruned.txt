Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, the structure. A 6-membered aromatic ring is a benzene ring. Di-substituted means two substituents are attached. The total is 8 carbons, so the ring has 6 carbons. The substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait, the total is 8 carbons in the compound. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. So substituents add up to 2 carbons. But wait, substituents can be in pairs if they are two groups. So maybe each substituent is a single carbon group, but perhaps they are in a way that the total adds up to 2 carbons.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. The FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So that means one substituent is a carbonyl group, another is a halogen (like Cl or Br). Oh wait, but carbonyl is a functional group, so maybe it's a ketone or something. Alternatively, maybe an ester or an aldehyde? Wait, but the ring is aromatic, so substituents are attached to the ring.

Wait, but combining the two substituents: a carbonyl group and a halogen. So, the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone, maybe a COOR group?) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.)

Wait, but wait, the total number of carbons is 8. The benzene has 6. So the substituents must add 2 carbons. So each substituent would have 1 carbon? That seems possible.

Wait, but a carbonyl group could be, for example, a carbonyl attached directly to the ring. Like as a ketone: Ar-CO-R. But wait, that
