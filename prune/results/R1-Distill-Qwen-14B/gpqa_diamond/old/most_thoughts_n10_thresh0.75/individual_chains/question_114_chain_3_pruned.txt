Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually an addition reaction. But wait, how does that work exactly?

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. The ketone has a carbonyl group, which is electrophilic, so the CN- would attack there. But wait, in the product, we have a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group. Oh right, I think this involves a two-step process. First, the addition of cyanide to the carbonyl, forming something like a cyanohydrin.

So, the reaction would proceed as follows: the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with NaCN to form a cyanohydrin. But wait, does that require any acid catalysis? I think that for the formation of cyanohydrins, an acid catalyst is needed. Because the carbonyl oxygen is deprotonated in the presence of acid, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which helps the nucleophile (CN-) attack.

So, reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options
