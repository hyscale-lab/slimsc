Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully and break it down.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture X can decolorize bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids. Importantly, this Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. 

Then, both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, and only one substance Z is formed. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. This Z is part of mixture Y and is used widely as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which probably means it's a saturated compound, maybe an alkane. 

Moreover, the question says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So, whatever X is, its components don't have conjugated double bonds.

Hmm. Let me think about what each part means.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Substances that do this typically have unsaturated bonds because bromine (Br2) adds across double or triple bonds, causing the color to disappear. So X has some kind of unsaturated compounds. But the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds in X, so maybe each component has a single double bond or triple bond, but not conjugated ones. So perhaps each is an alkene with a single double bond, or maybe an alkyne.

Then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation is when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, the O in H2O2 is both oxidized (to O2) and reduced (to H2O). 

But wait, in this problem, X is a mixture of two liquids, and Y is also a mixture, but formed from X via disproportionation. So perhaps each component in X undergoes disproportionation.

Wait, but the reaction is treated with Pt when heated—so maybe a hydrogenation or some other catalytic reaction. Alternatively, it could be a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

But let's think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So after hydrogenation, all the double and triple bonds are saturated, perhaps turning alkenes into alkanes, or alkynes into alkanes.

Because Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28%. Let's calculate that. So, the mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of compound) = 14.28%. That's about 1/7, because 14.28 is roughly 100 divided by 7 (≈14.2857). So the hydrogen makes up 1/7 of the molecule's mass.

Let me figure out what Z is. Let's say Z is CnH2m. The mass of H in Z is (2m * 1)/(12n + 2m) ) = 14.28% ≈ 0.1428. Let's set up the equation:

(2m) / (12n + 2m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2m = 0.1428*(12n + 2m)

Let me compute 0.1428 *12n → 1.7136n and 0.1428*2m=0.2856m.

So: 2m = 1.7136n + 0.2856m

Bring terms with m to left:

2m - 0.2856m = 1.7136n → 1.7144 m = 1.7136n → approximately m ≈ n.

But wait, I can probably do this more precisely. Let's compute 14.28% as 1/7 exactly, because 100/7 is approximately 14.2857%. So 1/7 is exactly 0.142857...

So equation becomes:

(2m) / (12n + 2m) = 1/7

Cross multiply:

7*2m = 12n + 2m → 14m = 12n + 2m → 12m =12n → m =n.

So m equals n. So Z is CnH2n. But wait, that's the general formula for alkenes (each double bond reduces the number of H). Wait, no—alkenes have CnH2n-2. Wait, no, wait: an alkene has CnH2n. Wait, no, wait. Let's see, for ethylene (C2H4), n=2, 2n=4, so yes. But wait, but that's if it's a single double bond. So for a saturated compound, like an alkane, it's CnH2n+2.

Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon, and after hydrogenation, it's Z. So if X and Y are unsaturated, hydrogenation would saturate them. So if X has alkenes, hydrogenation would turn them into alkanes. But Z is CnH2n, which isn't an alkane. Wait, that's confusing. Because if X is, say, an alkene, then hydrogenation would give an alkane. So if Z is CnH2n, perhaps it's an alkene, but it doesn't react further with hydrogen. But that doesn't make sense because alkenes do react with H2. Oh, wait, the problem says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be fully saturated. So, that can't be. So perhaps Z isn't an alkene but maybe a cycloalkane or something else?

Wait, but let's think again. The formula I found is 2m = 12n * (1/7) + 2m*(1/7). Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, let's think of Z as a specific compound. Let me list some hydrocarbons and see which one has hydrogen as 14.28% by mass.

Take ethane, C2H6: H is 6/(24 +6) =6/30=0.2 → 20%. Not 14.28%.

Propane, C3H8: H is 8/(36 +8)=8/44≈0.1818, 18.18%. Closer, but not 14.28%.

But wait, perhaps it's a larger molecule. Let's try butane, C4H10: H is 10/(48+10)=10/58≈0.1724, about 17.24%. Still higher.

What about pentane (C5H12): 12/(60+12)=12/72=0.1666, about 16.66%.

Hmm. Maybe it's a cyclic compound. Let's try cyclopropane, C3H6: H is 6/(36 +6)=6/42≈0.1428, which is exactly 14.28%. Oh! So cyclopropane has H as 14.28%.

Wait, but cyclopropane is C3H6. So that's our Z?

Wait, but cyclopropane is a cyclic alkane, which is saturated. So if X and Y are unsaturated, but when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane? Or maybe cyclopropane is Z.

Let me think about the hydrogenation part.

Wait, but if X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is cyclopropane, then what were X and Y?

Wait, or perhaps Z is something else. Let me make sure.

Wait, another possibility: C2H4. Wait, C2H4 is ethylene. Let's compute H mass fraction: 4/(24 +4)=4/28≈14.28%. Oh! So ethylene has a H mass fraction of about 14.28%.

Wait, but if Z is ethylene (C2H4), but ethylene is an alkene, which would react with hydrogen. But the problem says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so that can't be. So Z must be a fully saturated compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck: the problem says that Z is a hydrocarbon (so either alkane, alkene, alkyne). But it doesn't react further with hydrogen, which suggests it's an alkane. Because alkanes don't react with hydrogen. Alkenes and alkynes do.

But earlier, when I calculated for C3H6 (cyclopropane), the H fraction is 14.28%. Then, Z would be CH2 groups arranged in a ring. So perhaps Z is cyclopropane, C3H6.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a saturated compound (no double bonds), so it doesn't react with hydrogen. That fits with the problem statement.

But wait, wait another moment. Let me compute the hydrogen percentage for cyclopropane.

Molecular formula C3H6.

Molar mass: 3*12 +6*1=36 +6=42 g/mol.

Hydrogen mass is 6 g. So 6/42 = 0.142857, which is exactly 14.2857%, so 14.28% when rounded.

So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6.

Wait, but cyclopropane isn't a constituent of mixture Y. The question says, "Z is a constituent of mixture Y." So one of the components of Y is cyclopropane.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the process.

Mixture X is treated with Pt and heated to form Y via disproportionation.

Wait, let me think about another possible reaction. Oh! Maybe X is a di-substituted alkene, and upon reaction with Pt (catalytic hydrogenation), it hydrogenates into cyclopropane? No, that doesn't make sense. Because hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the components of X are alkenes, which upon some reaction form different products.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon heating with Pt, they undergo some kind of rearrangement or addition to form alkanes?

But then, why would Y not decolorize bromine? Because if Y had alkanes, they wouldn't react with bromine. So perhaps Y is a mixture of alkanes, which wouldn't decolorize bromine. But X has alkenes, which would. So that aligns with the problem statement.

Wait, but the process of X transforming into Y via disproportionation with Pt heating. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of a di-substituted alkene and another alkene. Let's think about a possible example.

Wait, another approach: the hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, which is cyclopropane (C3H6). So, perhaps X and Y are dienes or something else that upon hydrogenation would form C3H6.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the hydrogenation. If X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two other substances, and hydrogenation of both leads to Z, which is C3H6.

Wait, that would imply that each component in X and Y, when hydrogenated, gives C3H6. So each component in X and Y must be something that upon hydrogenation gives C3H6.

Wait, maybe the components of X are alkenes with formula that hydrogenate to C3H6. So, for example, if X has C3H4 (like propyne or propene), then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple or double bond.

Wait, but propene (C3H6) is already an alkene, so hydrogenation would give propane (C3H8). But that's not Z. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), and hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, then X and Y must have unsaturated bonds that hydrogenate to C3H6. So, for example, if X has an alkyne, like propyne (C3H4), hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, turning it into propane (C3H8). But that's not Z.

Wait, maybe Z is not C3H6 but something else. Let me try another approach.

Wait, I calculated that Z is C3H6, but perhaps I made a mistake because Z is a constituent of Y and Y is formed via a disproportionation.

Wait, let's think of Z as a different compound. Let me compute the possible molecular formula again.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, which is 1/7.

Let me consider other possibilities. Maybe Z is something like C4H8. Let's see. Its H mass is 8/(48+8)=8/56≈0.1428, which is exactly 14.28% as well. Oh! So C4H8 is another possibility.

Wait, but C4H8 can be either 1-butene or cis/trans butene, but more importantly, it's an alkene. So if Z is C4H8, which is an alkene, why doesn't it react further with hydrogen? Because if Z is 1-butene, it would still react with H2 in presence of a catalyst to form butane. Wait, but the problem says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so perhaps Z is a fully saturated compound. So that would make C4H8 unlikely, as it's an alkene.

Wait, but C4H8 is less likely because Z is part of Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine, meaning Y has no double bonds. So Y must have only single bonds, so Z must be a single-bonded compound as well. Therefore, Z can't be an alkene.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

For Z's H mass fraction: 14.28% is 1/7.

So, let me set up the equation again.

Hydrogen mass fraction = (H atoms * 1) / (molar mass) = (2n) / (12n + 2m?) Wait, no, let me think in terms of the formula CnHm.

Wait, the mass of H is (m *1) / (12n + m) ) = 1/7.

So, (m) / (12n + m) ) = 1/7 → 7m =12n + m → 6m=12n → m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n.

Wait, but that's the formula for an alkene. Because alkenes have formula CnH2n.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, if Z is an alkene, it would react with H2. But the problem says Z doesn't react further, so Z can't be an alkene. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again.

Another approach: maybe Z is a cycloalkane. For example, cyclohexane is C6H12. Let's compute H fraction: 12/(72+12)=12/84≈0.1428, which is 14.28%. Oh! So cyclohexane has H as 14.28%. So Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a fully saturated compound (alkane), so it won't react with H2, which fits the problem statement. So Z is C6H12, cyclohexane.

So, then, the hydrogenation of X and Y gives cyclohexane. So, X and Y must be substances that upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each component of X is a diene (maybe a conjugated diene) that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. Or perhaps something else.

Wait, but the problem states that in mixture X, there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So each component in X has single double bonds or triple bonds, not conjugated.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about what would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. If a diene (like 1,3-cyclohexadiene) were hydrogenated, it would become cyclohexane. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds, which the problem says X doesn't have.

So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe X has two different alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but that seems unlikely because each alkene would have to be different but both hydrogenate to the same product. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are structural isomers but both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a ring structure, so perhaps the alkenes are cyclic as well, but without conjugation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two cyclic alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, opens up to form cyclohexane. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps X has two different alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give cyclohexane. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which is part of a larger structure that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of another angle.

So, the problem says that mixture Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction of X, using Pt and heat. So each component in X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form two components in Y. Because X is equimolar, and Y is equimolar as well.

Wait, but in a typical disproportionation, one molecule is both oxidized and reduced. But in this case, X is a mixture of two liquids, so perhaps each of the two components undergoes a disproportionation.

Wait, perhaps X has two alkenes, each of which upon reaction with Pt and heat, undergoes a decomposition or rearrangement to form two other compounds (the components of Y).

Alternatively, perhaps X has two alkenes that each form a diol upon some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, which suggests that Y has no double bonds. So Y must be a mixture of alkanes.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two alkanes. Because alkanes don't react with bromine, so Y doesn't decolorize it.

But then, when X is treated with Pt and H2, it would hydrogenate the alkenes to alkanes. Wait, but the problem says that both X and Y are hydrogenated to give Z. So, if X is a mixture of alkenes, and Y is a mixture of alkanes, then hydrogenating X would give alkanes, and hydrogenating Y would give the same product Z. But Y is already an alkane, so hydrogenation wouldn't change it. So that can't be because Y's hydrogenation would produce the same Y, but the problem says that Y's hydrogenation gives Z. So that can't be, because Y is an alkane, which doesn't react with H2.

This seems confusing. Let me try to think again.

Wait, the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So whatever X and Y are, their hydrogenation gives Z. So, for example, X could be a mixture of two alkynes, and Y could be a mixture of two alkenes. Then, hydrogenation would add H2 across triple bonds (alkynes → alkanes) and double bonds (alkenes → alkanes), but that would require that both reactions result in the same product, Z.

Alternatively, perhaps X and Y are isomers that upon hydrogenation give the same product. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two di-substituted alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two alkanes. But then, hydrogenating X would give alkanes, and hydrogenating Y would give the same alkanes as before. So this would imply that Z is the same as Y, which isn't possible if Y is a mixture of alkanes and Z is a single compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give the same alkane. But that would require that the alkenes are isomers that when hydrogenated become the same alkane, but that's impossible because alkenes are unsaturated and their hydrogenation gives alkanes, which are different for different alkenes.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Since Z has a mass fraction of H as 14.28%, and that's 1/7, which gives us the formula CnH2n. Wait, but that's an alkene, which can't be because Z doesn't react further with H2. So perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong, and Z is a cycloalkane. Let me try C3H6 again, which is cyclopropane. It has H as 14.28%.

So, Z is cyclopropane. Then, X and Y, when hydrogenated, give cyclopropane. But for X and Y to hydrogenate to cyclopropane, X and Y must be cyclopropane with double bonds.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because cyclopropane is a ring with three carbons. To get cyclopropane via hydrogenation, perhaps the starting material is a cyclopropane ring with a double bond or a triple bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two allenes or something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the components of X are each a diene, but without conjugated bonds, as per the problem statement. For example, maybe each component is a diene with non-conjugated double bonds, like 1,4-pentadiene. But when hydrogenated, that would give a longer chain alkane. But then, how would that give cyclopropane? That seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is a mixture of two allenes, and Y is a mixture of their hydrogenation products, which are alkanes. Then, when Y is hydrogenated, nothing happens because they are already alkanes. But the problem says that Y's hydrogenation gives Z, which is cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm, 12 is the number of H in something like ethylene (C2H4) times 3, but I'm not sure. Let me think of possible X components.

If Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), then perhaps the components of X are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclopropane. But how?

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a larger ring. For example, cyclopropene (C3H4), which is an alkyne with a ring. Wait, but cyclopropene is a ring with a triple bond. No, wait, cyclopropene is a cycloalkene, I think.

Wait, cyclopropene has the formula C3H4. If you hydrogenate that, you'd get cyclopropane (C3H6). So maybe X is a mixture of cyclopropene and another compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclopropane, then each must have a formula that upon adding 2 H's (from H2) becomes C3H6.

So, the formula before hydrogenation would be C3H4. So, something like propyne (C3H4) would, upon hydrogenation, become propane (C3H8), which is not Z. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a di-substituted alkene, but that's not adding up.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of X as a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives the same Z. So for each component in X, the formula is such that upon adding H2, it becomes Z.

So, for Z being C3H6, which is cyclopropane, the formula before hydrogenation would be C3H4 (since each H2 adds two H's, so 4 H's become 6). So each component of X would be C3H4, which is an alkyne (like propyne) or an alkene with a triple bond elsewhere.

Wait, but propyne is C3H4, which is an alkyne. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes propane (C3H8). So that's not Z. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of X as a mixture of two alkenes that upon addition of H2 become the same Z. So, each component in X is an alkene, and their hydrogenation product is Z.

So, for example, if X is a mixture of 1-propene and 2-propene (but that's the same as 1-propene, so that's not a mixture), but perhaps another scenario. Wait, but 1-propene (propene) is C3H6, which upon hydrogenation becomes propane (C3H8). Again, not Z.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the components of X are each an alkyne, and upon hydrogenation, they become alkenes. But that doesn't fit with the product Z.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two dienes, each with two double bonds, but the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds, so each component has perhaps isolated double bonds.

Wait, but how would that hydrogenate to Z? Let's say X is a mixture of two dienes, each with two isolated double bonds. Upon hydrogenation, each would add two H2 molecules, turning each double bond into a single bond. So, for example, if X is a mixture of 1,3-pentadiene and another similar diene, but that seems too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different allenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives Z.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the total hydrogen atoms in X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Assuming that each component of X is an alkene with formula CnH2n, the number of H would be 2n. If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with formula CnH2n, then the total H in X would be 2n + 2m, where n and m are the carbons in each component.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that each component in X is a single alkene, and after hydrogenation, gives Z. So, let's say each component in X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation gives Z, which is C3H6 (cyclopropane). So, each component would have to have formula C3H4, which is an alkyne. But as before, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes that each upon hydrogenation give the same Z. So, for example, if Z is C3H8 (propane), then each component of X would have formula C3H6 (alkenes). But then, when you hydrogenate an alkene, you add two H's, turning C3H6 into C3H8. But the problem says that Z is C3H6, which is an alkene. That doesn't fit because Z doesn't react with hydrogen.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids. Upon treatment with Pt and heat, it forms Y via disproportionation. Then, both X and Y when hydrogenated give Z.

Moreover, Y does not decolorize bromine, which suggests that Y consists of alkanes.

So, perhaps X has two alkenes, which upon some reaction (like hydrogenation) become alkanes, but that's not leading me directly.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the concept of disproportionation. In disproportionation, a single substance is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps each component of X undergoes a disproportionation to form two components in Y.

But since X is a mixture of two liquids, perhaps each component undergoes a different disproportionation.

Wait, for example, consider H2O2: in acidic conditions, it can disproportionate into H2O and O2. But I'm not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is an alkyne, and upon heating with Pt, they undergo some kind of decomposition to form alkenes and other products. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the components in X are alkenes with triple bonds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the components of X are allenes, which upon heating with Pt, undergo some rearrangement.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Let me recap the key points:

1. X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water → contains alkenes or alkynes.

2. X upon heating with Pt undergoes disproportionation to form Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine → Y has alkanes.

3. Hydrogenation of X and Y both give Z, a hydrocarbon with H mass fraction 14.28% → Z is C3H6 (cyclopropane) or C4H8 (but that's an alkene, which would react with H2, so no). So Z must be C3H6, cyclopropane.

4. Z is a constituent of Y, which is a mixture of alkanes. But cyclopropane is an alkane, so that makes sense.

So, Y is a mixture of two alkanes, one of which is cyclopropane (C3H6). Wait, but wait, cyclopropane is C3H6, which is an alkane, but it's a cyclic one.

So, Y is a mixture of two alkanes, one of which is cyclopropane. The other must be another alkane, perhaps propane (C3H8) or butane (C4H10), etc.

Wait, but if Y is a mixture of two alkanes, and one is cyclopropane (C3H6), then the other must be a larger alkane. But then, when Y is hydrogenated, it would stay the same because alkanes don't react with H2. But the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives Z, which is a constituent of Y. So perhaps Y contains cyclopropane and another compound that upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane.

Wait, no, that doesn't fit because Y is a mixture of alkanes. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes, and when hydrogenated, they give cyclopropane. But that's impossible because hydrogenation adds H2, which would increase the number of H's, not decrease.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong. Let me think that Z is a product from both X and Y. So X and Y have some unsaturated bonds that, when hydrogenated, give Z.

If Y is a mixture of alkanes, then hydrogenating Y wouldn't change anything. So perhaps Y is not a mixture of alkanes but of something else. Maybe Y is a mixture of alkenes and alkanes. But the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine, implying no alkenes. So Y must be alkanes.

Wait, maybe Y is a mixture of two alkanes, and one of them is cyclopropane. Then, when Y is hydrogenated, it remains as cyclopropane. So that would make Z cyclopropane. But the problem says that the hydrogenation of Y gives Z. So if Y has cyclopropane, then hydrogenation wouldn't change it, which fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the components of Y are alkenes, but that would contradict the bromine test. Hmm.

I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach the problem from the multiple-choice options.

The options are the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X. Let's consider possible structures.

If each component of X is an alkene, and X has two components, each with n and m carbons.

Since X is equimolar, perhaps each component has the same number of moles. But the problem doesn't specify the volumes or moles, so perhaps each component has the same molecular formula.

Wait, but the problem says X is an equimolar mixture, so each component is present in equal moles.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of X as two alkenes, each with the same number of carbons, but different structures.

Wait, but the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So each component has a single double bond or triple bond, not conjugated.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with formula C3H6, but that seems unlikely because they'd be structural isomers.

Wait, but no, if X has two alkenes, each with formula C3H6, and each upon hydrogenation gives C3H8 (propane). But that's not Z, which is C3H6. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps X has two different alkenes, each with formula C2H4. Upon hydrogenation, each would give ethane (C2H6). But Z is C3H6, which is different.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X has two different dienes, each with formula C4H6. Upon hydrogenation, each would add 2 H2, becoming C4H10 (butane). But that's not Z.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, which suggests that the hydrogenation adds two H's to make it from C3H4. So, each component of X would be C3H4 (an alkyne).

So, if X is a mixture of two alkynes, each C3H4, then upon hydrogenation, each would add two H's, becoming C3H6 (Z). But then, why is Y formed via a disproportionation reaction of X?

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two alkynes (like propyne and another alkyne), then upon treatment with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo a reaction. But I'm not sure what kind of reaction that would be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the components of X are each an alkyne, and upon treatment with Pt and heat, they undergo a hydrogenation to form alkenes, but that doesn't explain the formation of Y as a mixture of two liquids.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decomposition or rearrangement.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the information.

Since Z is C3H6 (cyclopropane), and its hydrogenation doesn't change it, then X must consist of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give cyclopropane.

But how?

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two allenes (cumulenes) like C3H4, which upon hydrogenation would add two H's, becoming C3H6.

But wait, allenes have two adjacent double bonds, but the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two propenes (but that's the same compound), so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps each component of X is a cyclic alkene, like cyclopropane with a double bond. For example, cyclopropene (C3H4), which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane (C3H6). So, if X is a mixture of two such cyclic alkenes, then hydrogenation would give Z as cyclopropane.

But then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, what happens? It would form Y. But the problem says that X → Y via a disproportionation. So perhaps the alkenes in X decompose into different products.

Alternatively, perhaps X has two different cyclic alkenes that, upon some reaction, form two other compounds in Y.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for a different angle.

The question is about the total number of H atoms in X's two liquids. Let's assume each component in X is a molecule with a certain number of H's.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with formula CnH2n. Then, each would have 2n H's. If both are same (like two different C2H4 molecules), but that's not possible. So perhaps each is a different alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of propene (C3H6) and another alkene, but that doesn't fit with Z being C3H6.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of propylene (C3H6) and another alkene, say, butene (C4H8), but that's not possible because butene is C4H8, which upon hydrogenation would give C4H10, not Z.

Wait, but earlier I found that the formula for Z is CnH2n, which is an alkene, but that can't be because Z doesn't react with H2. So maybe Z is a cycloalkane, which has the same formula as an alkene (CnH2n), but is a saturated ring.

So, Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), which is a cycloalkane, and doesn't react with H2.

So, if X is a mixture of two alkenes that upon hydrogenation give cyclopropane, each of X's components must have formula C3H4 (since adding two H's would make C3H6). But C3H4 can be either propyne (an alkyne) or propene with a triple bond elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, propyne is C3H4. Upon hydrogenation, it would become propane (C3H8), which is not Z. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different allenes, each C3H4. Upon hydrogenation, each would become C3H6, which is cyclopropane. But I'm not sure how the allenes would hydrogenate into cyclopropane.

Alternatively, perhaps the components of X are each a different di-substituted alkene, but that's getting too vague.

Given the time I've spent and not getting further, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Assuming that each component in X is an alkene with formula CnH2n, and X is a mixture of two such alkenes.

Let me assume that each component has 6 H atoms (C3H6). So two would have 12 H. But 12 is option D.

But wait, the problem says that the mixture X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to a disproportionation. So perhaps each component in X undergoes a reaction that produces two different products in Y. For example, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which in Y is a mixture of alkanes.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with 8 H atoms (like C4H8). Then, two would have 16 H, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Z is C3H6, which would require X's components to be C3H4, which would have 4 H each, so two would have 8 H, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with 6 H (C3H6). So each has 6 H, two components would have 12 H total. Option D is 12.

But in that case, if X is C3H6, then hydrogenation would give C3H8. But Z is C3H6. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two dienes, each with formula C4H6. Each has 6 H, two would have 12 H. Option D is 12.

But then, hydrogenation would add 2 H's per double bond. If each component is a diene, adding 2 H2 would make C4H10. But that's not Z.

Wait, unless each component in X is a triple bond. For example, propyne (C3H4) has 4 H. Two components would have 8 H, which is not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with formula C2H4. Each has 4 H, so two would have 8 H. But option A is 16, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is C4H8 (but that's an alkene, which upon hydrogenation would give C4H10, not Z). So not helpful.

I'm getting stuck, so I'll have to make a guess. Based on the H mass fraction pointing to Z being C3H6 (cyclopropane), and considering the possible structures, the components of X might be C3H4 (alkynes), which upon hydrogenation give Z. Each C3H4 has 4 H, two components would have 8 H, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene with formula C3H6, giving 6 H each. Two components would have 12 H, option D.

But earlier that doesn't fit with the hydrogenation leading to Z being C3H6, unless the alkenes in X are cyclopropane rings with a double bond, which upon hydrogenation become cyclopropane.

In any case, the options are limited, and I'll have to choose based on the calculations.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the total H in X's two liquids. Suppose each is an alkene with formula CnH2n. Let's say each has 6 H (n=3 → C3H6). Two of them would have 12 H in total. So option D.

But then, hydrogenation would add 2 H per double bond, making C3H8, which is propane. But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is 12 H, option D.


The problem involves analyzing the composition of mixture X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes). Upon treatment with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, implying Y contains only alkanes. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield a single hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. This corresponds to a molecular formula of C₃H₆, identified as cyclopropane, a saturated cyclic alkane that does not react further with hydrogen.

Key points:
1. **Hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z (C₃H₆)**: This indicates that the components of X must be unsaturated compounds (alkenes or alkynes) that hydrogenate to form cyclopropane.
2. **Mixture X contains no conjugated multiple bonds**: Each component of X has isolated double or triple bonds.
3. **Mixture Y contains alkanes**: Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, it must consist of fully saturated compounds.

Given that Z is C₃H₆ (cyclopropane), the components of X must be unsaturated compounds (e.g., alkynes or alkenes) that hydrogenate to form cyclopropane. A plausible scenario is that X contains two alkynes, each with the formula C₃H₄, which upon hydrogenation add two hydrogens to form C₃H₆. Each alkyne (C₃H₄) contains 4 hydrogen atoms, and since X is a mixture of two such components, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X is:

\[
4 \, (\text{from first alkyne}) + 4 \, (\text{from second alkyne}) = 8 \, \text{hydrogen atoms}.
\]

However, this does not match any of the provided options. Reconsidering the problem, if X consists of two alkenes, each with the formula C₃H₆, the total number of hydrogen atoms would be:

\[
6 \, (\text{from first alkene}) + 6 \, (\text{from second alkene}) = 12 \, \text{hydrogen atoms}.
\]

This aligns with option D. While this does not perfectly fit the hydrogenation pathway to Z (C₃H₆), it is the most consistent conclusion based on the given data and the constraints of the problem.
