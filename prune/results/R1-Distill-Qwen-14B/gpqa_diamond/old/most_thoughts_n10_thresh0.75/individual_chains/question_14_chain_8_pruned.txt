Okay, so I have this ChIP-seq question and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a ChIP-seq experiment done on PFA-fixed human B cells using an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor. After doing the sequencing, they found peaks, but when they used PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. I need to figure out where these disappearing peaks are located.

Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker used to fix proteins to the DNA they're bound to. So in ChIP-seq, using PFA crosslinking is standard because it preserves the interactions between proteins and DNA, making it easier to pull down the complexes.

Wait, but what's DSG? Oh right, DSG stands for dimethyl sulfoxide with glutathione. I think DSG is a reducing agent used to cleave disulfide bonds, but in the context of fixation, maybe it's used for something else. Oh wait, I think when you use PFA crosslinking, sometimes the DNA-protein crosslinks can be too strong, especially for certain regions. So sometimes people use additional steps like DSG or other agents to break those crosslinks more effectively.

Wait no, wait. I think DSG is sometimes used in combination with PFA to enhance crosslinking or perhaps to fix more efficiently. Or maybe it
