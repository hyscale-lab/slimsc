Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry problem. The question involves two reactions, A and B, and I need to select the correct major products from the given options. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, reaction A is the one where the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, and it's treated with BuLi followed by H+. Reaction B is a more complex molecule undergoing a Cope rearrangement upon heating. 

Let me tackle reaction A first. The starting material looks like a benzene ring with a substituent that is an ether group. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the structure would be benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, let me write it correctly. The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but it's but-2-en-1-yl. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent. Wait, no, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but but-2-en has the double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OCH2? No, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl), which is CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2- as the group. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- as the substituent, but attached where?

Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)m
