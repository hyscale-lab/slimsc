Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a theory that includes all possible interactions that can be written with the Standard Model fields, but with higher dimension operators. But what about the symmetries?

Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because in any relativistic theory, Lorentz symmetry must be preserved. So all operators should respect that, right? So option 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz indices and such, but do they necessarily have to respect Poincare? Or is it automatically included because the theory is built on a Lorentz-invariant spacetime? I think Poincare symmetry includes things like momentum conservation. But wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so maybe it's automatically Poincare invariant? Or does SMEFT not necessarily require all operators to respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, no. SMEFT is based on the Standard Model's gauge symmetry and Lorentz symmetry. Since the Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, and SMEFT is an extension, it must also respect it. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) is also a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. So 1 and 2 are both correct so far
