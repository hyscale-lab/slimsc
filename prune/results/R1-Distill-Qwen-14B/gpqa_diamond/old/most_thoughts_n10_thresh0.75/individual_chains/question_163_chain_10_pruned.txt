Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, along with the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and a solid. When it's dissolved in a strong acid, they should react. The reaction probably involves the acid neutralizing the hydroxide ions from the Fe(OH)3.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it should react with an acid like HCl. The general reaction might be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Right, because each OH- from Fe(OH)3 would react with H+ from the acid.

So the first step is to find out how much Fe(OH)3 there is. The mass given is 0.1 grams. I should calculate the number of moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3—Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe is 55.85, each OH is (16 +1) =17, and there are three OH groups. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Wait, let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 produces three moles of OH- because it's Fe(OH)3. So the OH- moles would be 0.000936 *3 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

When this reacts with the strong acid, a monobasic one like HCl, each H+ neutralizes an OH-. So the moles of H+ needed are equal to the moles of OH-, which is 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is molarity. Molarity is moles per liter. So to find the volume needed, I can use the formula M = moles / volume (in liters). Rearranged, volume = moles / M.

So volume V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. But wait, the options don't exactly match. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough; maybe due to rounding in the molar mass.

But wait, what about the total volume? The problem says the total volume is 100 cm³
