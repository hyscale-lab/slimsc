Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity is related to a star's radius and temperature, right? Oh wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Yeah, L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times the temperature to the fourth power.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. And also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but mass and luminosity, how are they connected? Oh, wait, maybe not directly here, because the problem says the stars are radiating as black bodies, so the main factors are R and T. So maybe the mass info is a red herring or maybe it's for another part.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because if they have the same peak wavelength, T1 = T2. So
