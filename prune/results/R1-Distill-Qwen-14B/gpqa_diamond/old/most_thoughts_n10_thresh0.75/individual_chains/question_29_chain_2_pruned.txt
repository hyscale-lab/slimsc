Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some gene mutations. Hmm, let me think through it. The question is about eliminating an anti-nutritional compound by mutating the gene responsible for it. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found changes in the first exon.

The intact gene and four mutants are given. I need to figure out which mutation would likely eliminate the compound. Wait, so the anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene's product, right? So if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made, making the barley usable.

Looking at the sequences, the changes are in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so any change here could alter the protein. But I need to see what kind of mutations each has and if they cause a frameshift or a stop codon or just an amino acid change.

Let me look at each mutant:

Intact is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact: Let's see the first part. Intact starts with ATGTTTCTC... Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTAC... So at position 3, T becomes C? Let me see, the first few nucleotides:
Intact: positions 1-12: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT...

Wait, maybe I should count where the changes are. So in the first exon, the first change is in the first few bases.

Wait, let's look for the exact mutations. The intact gene is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC ... TGA

So in the first part, the sequence changes from TTT CTC to TCT TAC.

So the first few codons:

Intact: first codon is ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

Mutant1: first codon is ATG, then TCT (Ser), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), same as before. So the first two codons change from Phe Leu Ala Gly... to Ser Tyr Ala Gly...

So what does that do? Well, it changes the amino acids but doesn't cause a frameshift because the mutation is a point mutation within the same reading frame. So the rest of the codons would read correctly. Unless it introduces a stop codon early on.

Wait, does any of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon? Let's see the end. The intact gene ends with ... TGA, but looking at the sequences, I think they all end in TGA, which is a stop codon. So wait, how are these sequences presented? Because the end is the same, perhaps the changes are upstream.

Wait, no, in the sequences given, the end is the same. The end is TGA for all, but the changes are in the beginning.

Wait, but in the intact sequence, the first part is... ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant 1 has ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... etc. So the first two codons are changed to Ser and Tyr, which are different amino acids but not a stop.

Mutant 2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So the change is after the first codon. Let's break it down.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So first codon is ATG (same), second is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe), third is TAA (stop codon) instead of CTC (Leu). Oh wait, TAA is a stop codon. So in Mutant2, the second codon is TCT (Ser), third is TAA (stop). So that would cause a premature stop. The protein would be truncated after two amino acids instead of the full length.

If the gene is nonfunctional because it produces a truncated protein, then the compound might not be synthesized. So that would be helpful. But wait, does that always happen? Well, if the gene is for an enzyme, a frameshift or a stop early would likely disable it.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact:

Intact: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... Wait, let me see. Wait, the first part of Mutant3 is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT. So first codons: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), etc. So the second codon is TTT (Phe) but maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, let's re-express.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me compare each position:

Intact: positions 1-12: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT ... TGA.
