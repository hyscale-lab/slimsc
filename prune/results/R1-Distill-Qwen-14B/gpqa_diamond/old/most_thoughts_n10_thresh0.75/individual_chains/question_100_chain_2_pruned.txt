Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question describes a reaction sequence starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. But looking further, the first reaction is bromination in CCl4. Oh wait, propene would undergo bromination via addition, while cyclopropane might undergo substitution. Wait, but cyclopropane is more likely to undergo ring-opening reactions, but bromination in CCl4 is usually a free radical substitution for alkanes, but wait, propene is an alkene. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. When alkenes react with Br2, it's typically an addition reaction, not substitution. But the solvent here is CCl4, which I think is a condition for bromination via a radical mechanism, but that's usually for alkanes. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think.

Compound A is C3H6. If it's propene (CH2=CHCH3), then bromination in CCl4 would likely be an addition reaction. But wait, if it's cyclopropane, bromination might be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's propene and the reaction is an addition. Let me consider both possibilities.

Wait, the product B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. If B is a dibromide from propene, then reacting with alcoholic KOH
