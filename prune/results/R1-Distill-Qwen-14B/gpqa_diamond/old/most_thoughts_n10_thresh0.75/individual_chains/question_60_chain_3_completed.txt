Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a spacecraft traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a very high speed—0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years, and their astronaut is 22 years old. The options are about how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective, and whether he dies before getting there.

Wait, I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. So, the passage of time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) would be different from the time observed by someone on Earth (coordinate time). Oh right, this is from Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically special relativity.

So the key here is to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which requires using the time dilation formula. Let me think about what that formula is. I think it's the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

The formula for proper time (the astronaut's time) is tau equals t multiplied by the square root of (1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in Earth's frame, and v is the speed of the spacecraft.

But wait, to find tau, I need to know the time as measured from Earth. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the distance and then find the time from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth... I think it's about 160,000 light-years. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. Yeah, so around 163,000 ly.

So the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987*c. Let's see, how long does that take from Earth's perspective? Time is distance divided by speed. So t = distance / speed.

Let me compute that. The distance is 163,000 light-years. The speed is 0.99999987 times c. Since the distance is in light-years and the speed is a fraction of c, the time in years would be (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) → but wait, since speed is in terms of c, the units would be (ly) / (c * 0.99999987) → because ly is the distance light travels in a year at speed c. So time t = (163,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Calculating that: 163,000 / approx 1 (since 0.99999987 is very close to 1) is about 163,000 years. Wait, that's a huge number. But that's from Earth's perspective, but the astronaut's clock is running slower because of time dilation.

Wait no, that can't be right. Wait, no, no, no. Wait if the speed is 0.99999987c, then t = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 * c) → since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year at c, then (163,000 / 0.99999987) years is the time for Earth observers. Let me compute that.

Approximating 0.99999987 is almost 1. So 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 / 1 → 163,000 years. So Earth observers would see the spacecraft take about 163,000 years to reach Earth. But that's from Earth's frame, not the astronaut's.

But the astronaut's proper time is different. The time experienced by the astronaut is shorter due to time dilation. The formula is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, no, another approach: tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, tau = t * sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).

So v is 0.99999987 c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. (0.99999987)^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00000013)^2. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, actually, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Squaring this: (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) ) → 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) → let me compute that. 2.6e-7 is 0.00000026. The square root of that is approximately 5.1e-4 → about 0.00051.

So tau = t * 0.00051.

From Earth, t is about 163,000 years. So tau ≈ 163,000 * 0.00051 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 * 0.0005 is 81.5, and 163,000 * 0.00001 is 1.63. So 81.5 + 1.63 is about 83.13 years. Hmm, wait, but wait, I approximated sqrt(2.6e-7) as 0.00051. Let me be more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute v = 0.99999987c. Then v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute this exactly.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Let me compute (1 - a)^2 where a = 1.3e-7.

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a². Since a is small, a² is negligible. So it's approximately 1 - 2a. So 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 1 - 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, approximately 0.0005099.

So 163,000 years multiplied by 0.0005099 is approximately:

Let me compute 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163,000 * 0.0000099 ≈ 163,000 * 1e-6 is 0.163, 0.163 * 99 is 16.137. Wait, no, wait: 0.0000099 is 9.9e-6.

Wait, 163,000 * 9.9e-6 = 163,000 * 0.0000099 → Let me compute 163,000 * 0.00001 = 1.63. So 0.0000099 is 0.99 * 0.00001, so 1.63 * 0.99 ≈ 1.6137.

So adding 81.5 and 1.61 → approximately 83.11 years.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the astronaut would experience about 83 years. But looking at the options, none of them is 83. The options are 72, 77, 81, etc.

Hmm, perhaps my initial approximation is off because I used v=0.99999987c, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it without approximating so much. Let me try a more precise approach.

First, the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 163,000 light-years. The speed is v = 0.99999987 c.

Time from Earth's frame (t) is distance / speed. So t = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) → since 1 ly is light-year. Since speed is in terms of c, and 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, t in years is (163,000) / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987. Let me compute this division.

163,000 / 0.99999987.

Well, 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so 163,000 / (1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7), using the approximation 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x.

So 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) = 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-7.

163,000 * 1.3e-7 = (163,000) * (1.3e-7) → 163,000 is 1.63e5, so 1.63e5 * 1.3e-7 = (1.63 * 1.3) * 1e-2 → 2.119 * 0.01 = 0.02119.

So approximately 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.0212 years.

So t ≈ 163,000 years from Earth's frame.

Now, the proper time tau is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 approximately, as before.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, as before.

So tau = 163,000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005099.

Calculating that:

163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5

163,000 * 0.0000099 → 163,000 * 9.9e-6.

Wait, 9.9e-6 is 0.0000099. 163,000 * 0.0000099 = (163,000 * 1e-6) *9.9) = 0.163 * 9.9 = 1.6137.

So total tau ≈ 81.5 + 1.6137 ≈ 83.1137 years.

So about 83 years. But looking at the options, none is 83. The options are B)72, C)81, D)77.

Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud: I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. But perhaps it's more precise to say 163,000 ly as per my initial assumption.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7) more precisely.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.61245 * 1e-3.5 → wait, sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 = 1e-3.5 = 1e-3.5 = approx 3.16e-4.

Wait, but 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 = 3.1623e-4.

Wait, so sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * 3.1623e-4.

sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612.

So 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 1.612 * 3.1623 = approximately 5.097e-4. So 0.0005097.

So, 163,000 * 0.0005097 = ?

Let me compute 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163,000 * 0.0000097 ≈ 163,000 * 9.7e-6 = (163,000 * 1e-6) *9.7 → 0.163 *9.7=1.5811.

So 81.5 +1.5811 ≈ 83.08 years.

Hmm, about 83.08 years. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the distance is different. Let me try with the distance being 160,000 ly instead. Let me recalculate.

t (Earth frame) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000.016 years.

Tau = 160,000.016 * sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005097.

160,000 * 0.0005097 = (160,000 * 0.0005) + (160,000 * 0.0000097)

0.0005 is 5e-4, so 160,000 *5e-4 = 80.

0.0000097 is 9.7e-6, 160,000 *9.7e-6 = 1.552.

So total tau ≈ 80 + 1.552 = 81.552 years.

Hmm, about 81.55 years. So around 81.5 years.

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years. So perhaps option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the calculation I did earlier came to about 83 years, but that's when the distance is 163,000 ly. The options have 81, which would be closer to 160,000 ly. Maybe the question uses a different distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think another way: using the exact expression.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So time from Earth's frame is t = distance / v.

Proper time tau = t / gamma.

So tau = (distance / v) / (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) → tau = distance * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Wait, because (distance / v ) * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = (distance * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )) ) / v.

But distance is D, so let me compute this.

Let me compute sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) as before.

So, tau = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) / v.

But v = 0.99999987 c → D is in ly, so the units would be (ly) * (dimensionless) / (c * 0.99999987) → but since ly is light-year, which is distance light travels in a year. So (ly) / (c) = 1 year.

So, tau is [ (D) * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) ] / (0.99999987 )

Putting the numbers in, with D=163,000 ly.

tau = (163,000 * 5.099e-4 ) / 0.99999987 → approx.

163,000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 83.08 years, as before.

Divide by 0.99999987 → 83.08 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.08 / approx 1 → 83.08 years.

So if D is 163,000 ly, the proper time is about 83 years. But that's not one of the options. The closest option is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is different. Let me see what D would make tau exactly 81 years.

tau = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) / v.

So, tau = 81 years = D * sqrt(2.6e-7) / (0.99999987 )

So D = (81 * 0.99999987 ) / sqrt(2.6e-7 )

Compute sqrt(2.6e-7 )= 5.099e-4.

So D = (81 * 0.99999987 ) / 5.099e-4 → approx. 81 *1 is 81. So 81 /5.099e-4 = 81 / 0.0005099 ≈ 158,800 ly.

Hmm, so if the distance is about 158,800 ly, then the proper time is 81 years. But I thought the distance is about 163,000 ly. So perhaps the intended answer is 81 years, which is option C.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier because I'm mixing up the calculations. Let me try another approach. Maybe use the exact v value.

v = 0.99999987 c.

Calculate gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7 )^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.3e-7 = 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(2.6e-7 )= 5.099e-4.

Gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1960.14.

So gamma is approximately 1960.14.

So from Earth's frame, t = D/v = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c).

But 1 ly is c * 1 year, so t = (163,000) / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) → 163,000 + 0.02119 = 163,000.02119 years.

Now, the proper time tau is t / gamma → 163,000.02119 / 1960.14 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 / 1960.14 = approx 83.13 years.

So again, approximately 83 years.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, the question says, the astronaut is 22 years old. How old would he be when he arrives? If the proper time is 83 years, he would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old. The average lifetime is 150 years, so he would live to 105, which is well within their average lifespan.

But looking at the options, the question is asking how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth, from his perspective. So the options don't include 83 years, but option C is 81. So perhaps the intended answer is 81 years, but my calculation says about 83.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the distance is 100,000 ly or some other figure.

Wait, perhaps the distance is not 163,000 ly but 100,000 ly. Let me see.

If D = 100,000 ly.

t (Earth) = 100,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 100,000.13 years.

tau = t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) → 100,000.13 *5.099e-4 ≈ approx 50.99 years.

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the calculation using exact steps without approximations.

Let me calculate the exact value of sqrt(1 - v²/c²):

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000001 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9999997400000001 = 0.00000025999999995.

Wait, that's 2.5999999995e-7.

So sqrt(2.5999999995e-7) = approx 5.099e-4 again.

So the calculation holds.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as length contraction. Because from the spacecraft's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted.

So, in the spacecraft's frame, the distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163,000 *5.099e-4 ≈ 82.87 years.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the distance would be contracted, so the time experienced is D' / v, but v is still in terms of c.

Wait, if the distance is contracted, D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =163,000 *5.099e-4 ≈82.87 ly.

Wait, but the speed is 0.99999987c. So the time from the spacecraft's perspective is D' / v → 82.87 ly / (0.99999987 c) → since 1 ly / c = 1 year, so this would be approximately 82.87 /0.99999987 ≈82.87 years.

So that's the same as the proper time, which makes sense because tau is the time in the astronaut's frame.

So, again, about 83 years. So I'm getting the same result either way.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is 81. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for gamma. Let me compute gamma exactly.

v =0.99999987 c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000001 c^2.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9999997400000001 = 0.00000025999999995.

So, sqrt(0.00000025999999995) = sqrt(2.5999999995e-7) → approximately 5.099e-4, as before.

So gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1960.14.

So t (earth) is 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

tau = t / gamma = 163,000 /1960.14 ≈83.13 years.

Hmm.

Wait, but the options don't include 83. So perhaps the intended answer is 81, but using a different distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without exact calculation but through estimation.

Wait, another approach: when v is very close to c, the time experienced by the astronaut is roughly D / (c * (1 - v/c)).

Wait, because, using the approximation, when v ≈ c, 1 - v/c is very small, so time is approximately D / (c (1 - v/c)).

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → and since v is very close to c, 1 - v/c is small.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of gamma.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute it with the exact numbers.

v = 0.99999987c.

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - (0.9999997400000001) = 0.00000025999999995.

So sqrt(0.00000025999999995) = sqrt(2.5999999995e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So, gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈1960.14.

t (earth) = D / v = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) → which is (163,000 /0.99999987) years → approximately 163,000 years.

tau = t / gamma → 163,000 /1960.14 ≈83.13 years.

Hmm.

But the options are 72,77,81. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 81 years.

Wait, perhaps in the problem the distance is 100,000 ly? Let me check.

If D=100,000 ly.

tau = (100,000 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )) ) / v.

Which is (100,000 *5.099e-4) /0.99999987 → approx 50.99 /0.99999987 → ~50.99 years. That's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 163,000 ly, but the calculation comes to 83, so the answer is not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer uses a different approach, such as only considering the speed as 0.9999c and using an approximate calculation.

Wait, if the speed is 0.9999c, then gamma is about 70.9, and the time from Earth is 163,000/0.9999 ≈163,000 years, which would give tau=163,000 /70.9≈2300 years. That can't be right, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use a different speed. Wait, the problem states 0.99999987c, but perhaps the intended calculation is to use v=0.99c, which would have gamma about 7.09, and time would be 163,000 /0.99 ≈164,646 years. Then tau would be 164,646 /7.09 → about 23240 years. That's way too long, but not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the speed is so close to c that time is effectively instant from the astronaut's perspective, but that's not the case. Because at 0.99999987c, it's still a significant time.

Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question. The astronaut is 22 years old. His expected lifespan is 150 years. So if the journey takes 83 years from his perspective, he would die at 22+83=105, which is within his lifespan. So the answer would be that he arrives before dying. So the answer is not option A.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is about 83 years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 81, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another way: let me use precise calculation.

Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7):

We can compute 2.6e-7 = 0.00000026.

Compute the square root:

The square root of 0.00000026.

Well, 0.00000026 = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 → 1.612 * 0.00031623 → 0.0005096.

So, 0.0005096.

Then, tau = (163,000 * 0.0005096) / 0.99999987 → approx.

163,000 *0.0005096 = 82.98.

Divide by 0.99999987 → 82.98 / 0.99999987 ≈82.98 years.

Still about 83.

Hmm. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to neglect the time dilation and just compute the time experienced as D / (v) from the astronaut's frame, which would be incorrect. But that would be D * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2) / v.

Wait, another approach: the exact time.

t_earth = 163,000 ly / (0.99999987 c) → which is 163,000 /0.99999987 years.

tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

We can compute this as:

tau = (163000 / 0.99999987) * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

So, 163000 ≈ 163,000.

Compute the product:

Compute 163000 * sqrt(2.6e-7) / 0.99999987.

Which is (163000 * 0.0005099 ) / 0.99999987.

163000 * 0.0005099 = 82.98.

82.98 / 0.99999987 ≈82.98 years.

Hmm.

So, I'm stuck between this result and the options given. The only option close is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D)77. Let me see: what if the distance is 140,000 ly.

tau = 140,000 * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987 → 140,000 *0.0005099=71.386 → divide by 0.99999987 →71.386 ≈71.39 years. So option B is 72, which would be close.

But I don't know if the problem uses 140,000 ly as the distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps considering only the relativistic gamma factor without considering the distance.

Wait, but that's not possible without the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the time experienced be about 72 years, which is option B.

But according to my calculations, it's about 83, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different distance. Let me see what D would give tau=77, which is option D.

tau = D * sqrt(1 -v²/c² ) / v.

So D = (tau * v ) / sqrt(1 -v²/c^2 )

tau =77.

v=0.99999987 c.

sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2 )=5.099e-4.

So D= (77 * 0.99999987 c) / 5.099e-4 → but D is in ly, so c=1 ly/year.

D= (77 * 0.99999987 ) / 5.099e-4 → approx 77 / 5.099e-4.

77 / 0.0005099 ≈150,700 ly.

So if the distance is 150,700 ly, the proper time is 77 years.

Hmm, but the actual distance is about 163,000 ly, so perhaps the intended answer is 81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the time without considering the exact distance, leading to 81.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the calculations, the proper time is approximately 83 years, but the closest option is C)81.


The problem involves calculating the proper time experienced by an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \). The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 163,000 \, \text{ly} \). Using special relativity, the proper time (\( \tau \)) is related to the coordinate time (\( t \)) by the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the coordinate time (\( t \))
The coordinate time is the time measured in Earth's frame and is given by:

\[
t = \frac{D}{v}
\]

Substituting \( D = 163,000 \, \text{ly} \) and \( v = 0.99999987c \), we find:

\[
t = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

First, compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]

Thus:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}
\]

So:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1960.14
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the proper time (\( \tau \))
The proper time is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma}
\]

Substituting \( t \approx 163,000 \, \text{years} \) and \( \gamma \approx 1960.14 \):

\[
\tau \approx \frac{163,000}{1960.14} \approx 83.13 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated proper time is approximately \( 83 \, \text{years} \), but this value is not among the provided options. The closest option is \( 81 \, \text{years} \), which likely corresponds to a slightly different distance or approximated calculation. Given the options, the best match is:

**C) 81 years**
