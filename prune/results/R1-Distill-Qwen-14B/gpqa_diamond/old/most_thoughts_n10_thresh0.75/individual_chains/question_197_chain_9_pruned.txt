Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when alkenes react with phosphorus and HI, it's a way to do an elimination reaction, maybe a hydride shift or something. Alternatively, wait, no—red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, specifically for radical additions, but I think that's more for alkenes without stabilizing substituents. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus and HI is actually used for the dehydrohalogenation, like an elimination reaction. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Hmm. Alternatively, when an alkyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more about elimination to form alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Hmm, maybe I should think about the other part first—the spectral data.

The problem gives IR and 1H NMR data for Compound X. Let's look at the IR first. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, often indicative of O-H or N-H stretches. But then, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Also, peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might correspond to aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons usually aren't that downfield. Wait, but wait, what about an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But it's broad, which could suggest exchange with something, like an acidic proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH proton, but that's usually broad but maybe in a different region. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have broad signals around 10-12 ppm. So that peak at 10.5 could be a -COOH proton.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with two doublets. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Because the two sets of doublets are probably the two protons adjacent to substituents in the para positions. So for example, if you have substituents in positions 1 and 4, the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be one doublet, and positions 3 and 5 would be another. But wait, actually, if the substituents are in the para positions, the adjacent protons are in positions 2 and 6 (if substituents are at 1 and 4, but that's the same as 4 and 1). Alternatively, maybe it's a para-di
