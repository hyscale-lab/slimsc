Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about particle decays. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I remember that this kind of Lagrangian usually describes a Yukawa interaction, which is the kind that connects bosons with fermions, like how the Higgs field interacts with fermions.

So, Yukawa interactions typically mediate the decay of a boson into pairs of fermions. The mass term here is υ, which I think is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. So the boson X is getting its mass from this term, right? Because when you expand the Lagrangian, the mass of the fermion would come from the υ term, and the X term is the interaction part.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Now, I need to find which fermions can be produced when X decays. The key thing is that the total energy of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Also, since it's a boson decaying into fermions, each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The fermions are produced in pairs, like a quark and its antiquark, right? So each pair's rest mass (sum of the masses of the two particles) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in the rest frame of X, the decay products must be able to have enough energy to create their rest mass.

So I need to list all the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV, so their sum is like a few MeV. So u and d quarks can definitely be produced because their combined mass is way below 6 GeV.

The strange quark is heavier, around 100 MeV? Wait, no, I think more accurately, the strange quark is about 95 MeV, similar to up and down. So s and s̄ would have a combined rest mass of about 190 MeV, which is still way under 6 GeV.

Next, the charm quark is heavier, around 1.5 GeV. So a c and c̄ pair would have a combined mass of about 3 GeV. That's under 6 GeV, so that's allowed.

The bottom quark is even heavier, around 4.5 GeV. So a b and b̄ pair would have a combined mass of about 9 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So that's not allowed. Because the X is 6 GeV, and the bottom quarks would require 9 GeV. So X can't decay into b and b̄.

Wait, but wait another thing. For a boson at rest, the decay products must have enough energy. But when you're producing a fermion pair, the energy required is their rest mass. So if the fermion pair's rest mass is less than the boson's mass, then the decay is allowed. So for example, X → b b̄ would need 2*4.5 GeV = 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So this decay is not allowed.

Next, the top quark is way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So that's way beyond 6 GeV. So t and t̄ can't be produced either
