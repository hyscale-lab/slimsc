Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with acetic acid. Let's break down each step.

First reaction: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that acetic anhydride is a good acetylating agent. Bromine with pyridine... Wait, bromine in the presence of pyridine usually acts as a Lewis acid catalyst. Oh, right! This must be the formation of an acyl bromide. Acetic acid would react with acetic anhydride and Br2 to form acetyl bromide (maybe something like CH3COBr). Because when acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with acetic anhydride, it can form the acid chloride, but here Br is involved. Oh wait, yes, the reaction is: acetic acid + acetic anhydride + Br2 (with pyridine) → acetyl bromide. So product 1 is acetyl bromide, CH3COBr.

Second step: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Heating an acyl bromide with ethanol and acid... That's a typical nucleophilic acyl substitution. The bromide leaves, and ethanol's oxygen attacks. So product 2 would be ethyl acetate. Structure: CH3COOCH2CH3.

Wait, but wait, could it be something else? No, because the conditions are for an esterification. Since it's an acyl bromide reacting with ethanol, it should form the ester. So product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Third step: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophile. Reacting with an ester... In what way? Well, esters can undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. So the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the ester (CH3COOCH2CH3) would react with CN- to form CH2(CN)COOCH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, the structure is O
|
O-C-OCH2CH3. The attack would be on the carbonyl carbon, leading to substitution of the OR group. So the product would be CH2(CN)COO- plus something else? Or wait, maybe the mechanism is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis but with CN- as a nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the OEt group is replaced by CN. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The ester is CH3CO-OCH2CH3. When treated with NaCN, the CN- would attack the carbonyl, leading to substitution of the OCH2CH3 group with CN. So the product would be CH3C(O)CN, which is acrylonitrile? Wait, no, CH3C(O)CN is acetonitrile? No, wait, acetonitrile is CH3CN. Oh wait, no, wait. If the ester is CH3CO-OEt, and the CN- attacks, replacing the OEt group, then the product would be CH3CO-CN, which is acetyl cyanide, also known as ethanenitrile. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the OR is replaced by CN. So yes, product 3 is CH3CN, but wait, that can't be right because the ester is CH3COOEt. Wait, maybe I should think of the structure. The ester is CH3COOCH2CH3. When CN- attacks the carbonyl, they form a tetrahedral intermediate, and then the leaving group (OEt-) leaves, giving CH3C(O)CN. Wait, that's (CH3)CO-CN, which is indeed acetonitrile but with an extra methyl? No, wait. Wait, no. The original ester is ethyl acetate, which is CH3CO-OCH2CH3. When the CN- attacks, the OEt leaves, and the product would be CH3-C(O)-CN. Wait, but that's CH3(CO)CN. Or is it CH2(CN)COOH? No, no, because the ester has to lose the OEt group. So the product would be CH3CO-CN, which is acetonitrile with an ethanoyl group? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The ester is RCOOR'. CN- attacks, leading to RCO-CN and R'OH. So in this case, R is methyl (from acetic acid), R' is ethyl. So product 3 would be CH3CO-CN, which is acetonitrile, but wait, isn't that just CH3CN? No, CH3CO-CN is CH3-C(O)-CN, which is propanenitrile. Wait, no. Wait, the formula would be C2H5OOC-CH3? No, no, wait. Let me correct. The starting ester is CH3COOCH2CH3. When attacked by CN-, the product would be CH3C(O)CN, which is propanenitrile, also called acrylonitrile? Wait, no, acrylonitrile is CH2=CH-CN. So this product is CH3C(O)CN, which is ethanenitrile? No, wait. Let me look it up mentally. Oh, wait, the correct name is acetonitrile, but that's CH3CN. So I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of the ester under basic conditions. But no, it's treated with NaCN, which is a source of CN-.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the ester is undergoing a nucleophilic substitution, not at the carbonyl but somewhere else. But no, the ester's carbonyl is the reactive site. So the product should be CH3CO-CN, which is CH3-C(O)-CN. Wait, but that's a ketonitrile. So product 3 is CH3C(O)CN, which is propanenitrile or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that the reaction is the substitution of the ester's OR group with CN. So for ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3), substitution with CN would give CH3CO-CN, which is (CH3)CO-CN. So the structure is O=C(CN)(CH3). I think that's correct.

Fourth reaction: Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming product 4. NaH is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. 1,5-dibromopentane is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, under these conditions, NaH would deprotonate the compound to form an alkoxide, which then would attack the dibromide. But wait, product 3 is CH3C(O)CN. So, does it have any acidic protons? Let me think. The compound is CH3C(O)CN. The carbonyl oxygen is adjacent to the nitrile. Are there any alpha hydrogens? Yes, the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. The alpha hydrogens (the CH3 group) can be deprotonated by NaH, a strong base. So, when NaH is added to CH3C(O)CN, it will deprotonate the methyl group to form the corresponding enolate. Wait, but wait, nitriles are electron-withdrawing groups, which make the alpha hydrogens more acidic. So CH3-C(O)-CN has two alpha carbons: the methyl (one carbon) and the one adjacent to nitrile (but that's the carbonyl; perhaps not). So the methyl group's protons are alpha to both the carbonyl and the nitrile. So deprotonation would occur here.

Once deprotonated, the enolate would attack the 1,5-dibromopentane. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a vicinal dihalide, but more accurately, it's a dihalide with bromines on both ends of a five-carbon chain. It's BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. When the enolate attacks, it's an SN2 mechanism, so the enolate (a strong base) would attack one of the bromides. But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has two bromine atoms on opposite ends of a five-carbon chain. So when the enolate attacks, it would form a new carbon-carbon bond. Let me visualize:

The enolate is CH2- (from CH3 being deprotonated to CH2-), but wait, no. Let me think about the structure of product 3 again. Product 3 is CH3C(O)CN. The structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-CN

So, the alpha carbon is the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. Deprotonating that gives the enolate: [CH2C(O)CN]^- (but with a negative charge on the alpha carbon). This enolate would attack an adjacent bromide in the dibromide. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a five-carbon chain with Br on both ends.

So, when the enolate attacks one of the Br atoms in 1,5-dibromopentane, a new bond forms between the alpha carbon and the adjacent carbon in the dibromide. Let's model this:

Enolate: (CH2-)C(O)CN (actually, the enolate is CH2-C(O)CN^- )

Attacking 1,5-dibromopentane: Br-(CH2)4-Br

Wait, no. The structure of 1,5-dibromopentane is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So when the enolate (the conjugate base of CH3C(O)CN) attacks one of the Br atoms, the dibromide donates a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group to form a new bond.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the enolate (CH2C(O)CN^-) attacks the central CH2 group in the dibromide. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the enolate attacks the BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br, leading to the formation of a new carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps it's an SN2 reaction where the enolate attacks one of the Br atoms in 1,5-dibromopentane. So each Br is at the end of a five-carbon chain, meaning that the two Brs are on the first and fifth carbons of a five-carbon chain.

So when the enolate (from CH3C(O)CN) attacks, say, the first Br, it would form a bond between the alpha carbon (from the enolate) and the first carbon of the pentane. So the product would have the structure where the alpha carbon is connected to a five-carbon chain (from BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br). So the product would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out. Let me imagine:

The enolate is: CH2- (from the methyl group of CH3C(O)CN) attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is: CH2-C(O)CN^-.

When this enolate attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane (BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br), the enolate's CH2 group attacks one of the Br atoms. Let's say it attacks the first Br, so the enolate's CH2 connects to the first carbon of the pentane chain. The result would be:

CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN.

Wait, but the chain would be longer. Let me count the carbons. The enolate's CH2 is connected to the first carbon of the pentane (which is Br), so the product would have the enolate's CH2 attached to the first carbon, and the rest of the pentane chain would follow. Wait, but the enolate's CH2 is part of the molecule from product 3. So the product would have the structure:

CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN.

Wait, but that would be a six-carbon chain, because the enolate's CH2 is one carbon, and then the five carbons from the dibromide. Or wait, no: the dibromide is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So attacking one Br would give CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN, but that's five carbons from the dibromide plus the enolate's CH2 group, making it six carbons in total. Wait, no: the enolate's CH2 is the same as the first carbon of the pentane chain. So the product would have a chain like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN, but that doesn't seem right because the dibromide is Br-(CH2)4-Br, meaning the two Brs are on each end of the central (CH2)4 chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack is in the middle. Wait, no, because the dibromide is dihalide with Br on both ends, so each Br is on a terminal carbon. So the enolate can attack either end, leading to the same product because the molecule is symmetric.

So the product would be CH2(C(O)CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br), but wait, no, because after the attack, the Br would leave, and the enolate's CH2 would bond to the first carbon of the pentane.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mechanism. The enolate (CH2-) attacks the BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br, replacing the Br. So the product would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. But wait, that's a six-carbon chain, but the initial product is the enolate's CH2 connected to the five-carbon chain from the dibromide. So the structure is actually CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. So, the enolate's CH2 is at one end, and the rest is the five-carbon chain from the dibromide. So the product would have a 6-carbon chain attached to the C(O)CN group.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The enolate is CH2- (from CH3C(O)CN). The dibromide is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So when the enolate attacks, the Br is replaced by the enolate's CH2, resulting in CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. So the molecule would be (CH2)5-C(O)CN. Wait, but that would be hexanenitrile? No, because the C(O)CN is an acyl group. Wait, no. The structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. So the molecule is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-CN

That's 5 carbons from the dibromide plus the CH2 from the enolate, making 6 carbons in a row, ending with a ketonitrile group (C(O)CN). Hmm, so the product 4 would be pentyl ketonitrile? Or perhaps it's more accurately called 6-cyano-hexan-1-one? Wait, the carbonyl is at the end of the chain. So structure: CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN? No, wait, because the enolate connects to the first carbon of the pentane chain. So the structure would be CH2(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)-C(O)CN. Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me try to write the structure step by step.

Enolate: CH2- [from the CH3C(O)CN]

Dibromide: Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br

Enolate attacks one of the Br atoms, forming a bond between the CH2 of the enolate and the adjacent carbon (the one attached to Br). So the product would be:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN ?

Wait, no, because the enolate attack would bring the CH2 from the enolate to the first carbon of the dibromide. So the chain would be CH2 (from enolate) connected to the first CH2 of the pentane, making a longer chain. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN.

Wait, that's a seven-carbon chain? No, wait:

Enolate's CH2 attacks the first Br, so the product would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN? No, that can't be right. Let me think again. The dibromide is Br-(CH2)4-Br. So when the enolate attacks one Br, it replaces the Br with the CH2 from the enolate. So the product becomes CH2-(CH2)4-CH2-C(O)CN.

Wait, that's seven carbons in a row. Because the enolate's CH2 is added to the pentane chain, making a total of 6 carbons, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the number of carbons. The enolate is from CH3C(O)CN, which has 3 carbons (CH3, CO, CN). The dibromide is 1,5-dibromopentane, which has 5 carbons. So when the enolate attacks, the enolate's CH2 adds one carbon, making the new chain 5+1=6 carbons. So the product would have 6 carbons in a row, with the C(O)CN group at the end.

So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN, but that's 6 carbons. Wait, but that can't be because the enolate's CH2 is added to the first carbon of the pentane, making it a 6-carbon chain.

Wait, but the dibromide is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So the length is five carbons between the two Brs. When the enolate attacks, the CH2 from the enolate connects to the first carbon (where Br was), resulting in a chain of CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN. So that's six carbons in a row, with the ketonitrile group at the end.

Wait, but is the product a ketone? Because the enolate is from a ketone (CH3C(O)CN is a ketonitrile, which has a ketone group and a nitrile group). So when the enolate attacks, it's adding a new CH2 group to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, the enolate is the conjugate base, so the attack would be at the position where the bromide is, leading to alkylation of the alpha carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of this as an alkylation of the enolate. So the enolate (CH2-) attacks the dibromide, which is 1,5-dibromopentane. Each Br is on a different end, so the enolate would attack one end, and the other end would have another Br, but perhaps in this reaction, only one equivalent of the dibromide is used. Wait, no, the question says 'excess' sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. So perhaps the reaction is that each enolate can attack both ends. But it's more likely that each enolate attacks once, adding a five-carbon chain. Wait, maybe each molecule of product 3 can react twice with the dibromide? Because the dibromide has two Br atoms, but in this case, each enolate would attack one Br, adding a five-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the product 4 is a di-substituted compound. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the overall structure.

Product 4 would have two long alkyl chains attached to a central carbon, which is connected to a ketone and a nitrile group. Hmm, wait no. Alternatively, perhaps each enolate attacks one of the Br atoms in the dibromide, leading to a longer chain. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate's CH2 attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane once, leading to a product where the CH2 group is attached to the first carbon of the pentane, and the other Br remains. But with excess dibromide and NaH, perhaps both Br atoms are replaced. So maybe the enolate attacks both ends, adding two five-carbon chains. But that doesn't seem right, because the starting enolate is a single molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate attacks one Br, leading to a single substitution. So the product would have a five-carbon chain added to the alpha carbon (the CH2 group). So the structure would be:

CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN ?

Wait, but that's six carbons, but more accurately:

The enolate is CH2- (from CH3C(O)CN), and it attacks the Br in 1,5-dibromopentane, leading to:

CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-C(O)CN ?

Wait, no, that would be seven carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the product is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-C(O)CN? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me try to write it as:

The enolate is CH2−, which attacks the dibromide at one end, replacing Br with CH2. So the product would be CH2−(CH2)4−CH2−C(O)CN. That would make a six-carbon chain: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN.

Wait, but that's seven carbons. Let me count: the enolate's CH2 is one, followed by four CH2 groups from the pentane, then another CH2, making a total of six CH2 groups? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alkyl group added to the alpha carbon. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider that the final product is a ketone with a nitrile group and a long alkyl chain.

Wait, product 3 is CH3C(O)CN. When treated with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, NaH deprotonates the methyl group, forming the enolate CH2C(O)CN^-. Then, this enolate attacks 1,5-dibromopentane. The attack would be on one of the Br atoms, leading to substitution. Each molecule of enolate would attack once, adding a five-carbon chain to the alpha position.

So the product 4 would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN, but with the CH2 group from the enolate attached to the first carbon of the pentane. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN. Wait, that's six carbons in a row, ending with C(O)CN.

Wait, but that's a six-carbon chain, with the carbonyl and nitrile groups at the end. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. So the molecule is 6-cyano-hexan-1-one? Or maybe pentan-1-one with a nitrile at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the carbons correctly. The enolate's CH2 is one carbon, and the pentane chain is five carbons. So when the CH2 attacks the first Br, the product is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN. That's seven carbons, including the C(O)CN group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should think of the product as having a long alkyl chain attached to the alpha carbon of the carbonyl group. So the structure would be something like R-C(O)-CN, where R is a pentyl group (from the dibromide). But wait, the dibromide is 1,5-dibromopentane, which is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So when the enolate attacks one of the Br atoms, R would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2. So the product would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. Which is hexanenitrile with a ketone group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate's CH2 attacks the central part of the dibromide, but I don't think so because the dibromide is symmetrical, with Br on both ends.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double alkylation. Since NaH is in excess and the dibromide has two Br atoms, perhaps each enolate can attack twice, adding two five-carbon chains. But that would give a molecule with two pentyl groups attached to the alpha carbon. So the structure would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN. That would be 2-pentyl groups attached to the same carbon as the C(O)CN group.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the enolate is a strong base, and the dibromide has two Br atoms, perhaps both are substituted, leading to a bis-alkylation. So the product would be a dialkylation product.

So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

So that's two pentyl groups attached to the same carbon, which is also attached to the carbonyl and nitrile groups.

So the compound is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Wait, but that would make the structure a bit branched. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the enolate attacks once, adding a pentyl group to the alpha carbon. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. But that's a single chain, which might not fit with the 'excess' condition.

Wait, the question states 'excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane.' So perhaps two equivalents of the dibromide are used per equivalent of product 3. So each product 3 molecule would react with two equivalents of the dibromide, leading to a di-substituted product.

So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

So, the molecule is a gem-dialkyl ketonitrile, with two pentyl groups on the same carbon adjacent to the carbonyl and nitrile.

Now, the problem asks for the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.

So, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN. Let me write it as (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN, where the two CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 groups are attached to the same carbon (the alpha carbon) adjacent to the carbonyl and nitrile groups.

Wait, but each CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group is a pentyl group. But since both are the same (they came from the same dibromide), the molecule is symmetric, right? So each CH2 group in the pentyl chains would have equivalent hydrogens on both sides.

But wait, the two pentyl groups are identical because they're both derived from the same dibromide. So the molecule is symmetric, meaning that the two pentyl groups are mirror images of each other.

So, the structure is:

  CN
  |
C=O-C-(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2

Wait, no. The actual structure is:

O
||
C(CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2

So, the central carbon is attached to the carbonyl group, the nitrile group, and two pentyl groups.

Now, let's analyze the NMR.

First, the central carbon (the alpha carbon) is attached to two identical pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a nitrile. So the hydrogens on this carbon (if any) would be equivalent. But wait, the alpha carbon is the one attached to the two pentyl groups. So if the alpha carbon has two H's, they would be equivalent. But in the structure above, the alpha carbon (the one attached to the two pentyl groups) is connected to the carbonyl and the nitrile. Wait, no, in the enolate alkylation, the enolate's CH2 would attack, adding a CH2 group to the alpha position. So, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)CN.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the enolate is CH2-, which would add a CH2 group to the alpha position. So the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)CN.

So the central carbon is CH, attached to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a nitrile. Wait, no, because the CH is attached to two pentyl groups, and the C(O)CN is a substituent on that same carbon. So the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)CN.

Wait, but that would imply the central carbon is CH, which doesn't have four bonds. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me correct. The correct structure after alkylation would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)CH2-C(O)CN.

No, that's not right. Let me think again. The enolate is CH2-C(O)CN^-. When it attacks the Br in 1,5-dibromopentane, the Br is replaced by the CH2 group from the enolate. So the product would have the structure:

CH2-(CH2)4-CH2-C(O)CN.

Wait, that's a six-carbon chain: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN.

So the molecule is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. So the NMR would show the hydrogens on this chain.

But wait, considering the entire structure, the molecule is symmetrical? No, because the chain is straight. But if there are two identical chains attached to the alpha carbon, then it's symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the enolate attacks both ends of the dibromide, leading to a central carbon connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a nitrile. So the molecule is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN. So the central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups and the carbonyl and nitrile groups.

In that case, the molecule is symmetric. So each side (the two pentyl groups) would mirror each other. So the NMR would have fewer signals due to symmetry.

Now, let's analyze the NMR signals.

The molecule is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN. The structure is symmetric, so the two pentyl groups are mirror images.

Each pentyl group has five carbons:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

So each CH2 group's hydrogens would have equivalent counterparts on the other side.

Let me number the carbons in each pentyl chain from the central carbon:

1: CH2 connected to the central carbon.

2: CH2 next to 1.

3: CH2 next to 2.

4: CH2 next to 3.

5: CH2 at the end.

Because the molecule is symmetric, the protons on C1 (both sides) are equivalent.

Similarly, C2 on both sides are equivalent.

C3 on both sides are equivalent.

C4 on both sides are equivalent.

C5 on both sides are equivalent.

So each CH2 group in the pentyl chains will contribute a single signal for each position.

Wait, but in reality, the central CH2 (C1) is attached to the central carbon, which is connected to the carbonyl and nitrile. So the C1 CH2 groups are each attached to the same environment on both sides. So their protons are equivalent and will give a single signal.

Similarly, the C2 CH2 groups are equivalent on both sides, so they contribute another single signal.

C3: same, another signal.

C4: another signal.

C5: the terminal CH2 groups. But wait, in a straight chain, the terminal CH2 is the same on both ends, so their protons are equivalent. So C5 on both sides contribute one signal.

Wait, but wait. In the pentyl groups, the end groups are CH3, but wait no, in this case, each pentyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to the central carbon. So the end of each pentyl group is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group attached to the central carbon. So each pentyl chain is a five-carbon chain, with the first carbon attached to the central carbon, and the fifth carbon being a terminal CH2.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Central carbon (C0) is attached to two CH2 groups (each from a pentyl chain). So each CH2 group is at position 1 of the pentyl chain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each pentyl chain as:

C0 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2

But since there are two identical chains on C0, the molecule is symmetric. So the NMR would have signals for each unique set of hydrogens.

Let me outline the possible signals:

1. The two CH2 groups attached directly to C0: these are equivalent (due to symmetry) and would give a single triplet or whatever their splitting is, but all their Hs are equivalent, so one signal.

2. The next CH2 groups (second in the chain): each has two equivalent Hs, and because of symmetry, the two CH2 groups on either side are equivalent. So one signal.

3. Similarly for the third CH2 group: one signal.

4. The fourth CH2 group: one signal.

5. The fifth CH2 group (terminal): but wait, no, the chain is C0-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- (five carbons). So the fifth CH2 is the end, but since the molecule is symmetric, the terminal CH2 groups are equivalent. So another signal.

Wait, no. Wait, the chain is five carbons long. Let me number them:

C0 (central) connected to C1 (CH2), which is connected to C2 (CH2), C3 (CH2), C4 (CH2), C5 (CH2). So each chain is five CH2 groups.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbon atoms between the two Brs. So when the CH2 from the enolate attacks one Br, it forms a bond to the first carbon of the pentane chain, making the structure:

C0 (with C(O)CN and two CH2 groups attached) → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that would make the chain four carbons long from C0, because C0 is connected to the first CH2, then four more CH2 groups. Wait, no, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So when the enolate attacks one Br, the product is (CH2)5-C(O)CN, but that's not correct because the enolate's CH2 is added to the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me take a different approach. Suppose that product 4 has a structure where the central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a nitrile. So the molecule is symmetric, and each hydrogen in each position of the pentyl chains is equivalent to its counterpart on the other side.

So each CH2 in the pentyl chains would contribute a single signal.

Each CH2 in the pentyl group would have a unique environment based on its position.

Let's count the possible signals:

1. The CH2 groups directly attached to the central carbon (position 1): each has two Hs, and due to symmetry, they are equivalent. So one signal.

2. The next CH2 group (position 2): each has two Hs, and due to symmetry, they are equivalent. One signal.

3. The third CH2 group (position 3): same reasoning. One signal.

4. The fourth CH2 group (position 4): same. One signal.

5. The fifth CH2 group (position 5): same. One signal.

Wait, but in a five-carbon chain, the end CH2 (position 5) would be equivalent on both sides, so their Hs would be equivalent. So that's one signal.

So the pentyl chains contribute 5 distinct signals.

Additionally, there's the central carbon. Wait, the central carbon (the one attached to the two pentyl groups) is a CH2 group? Or a CH group? Let me think.

Earlier analysis: The product is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN. So the central carbon is the C in C(O)CN. Wait, no, the enolate's CH2 is attached to the central carbon, which is connected to the carbonyl and nitrile. So the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)CN.

Wait, no, that can't be because that would make the central carbon CH, which can't have four bonds. So the correct structure must have the CH2 groups attached to the carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)CH2-C(O)CN.

But that adds a single CH2 group, not two. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, which is making it hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol. No, because NaH is a strong base, and the reaction is alkylation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the product is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN, a single chain with six carbons. In that case, the NMR would show signals for each CH2 group in the chain.

But in this case, the chain is symmetric only if it's even-numbered, but six is even, so the middle would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, for six carbons, the middle is between C3 and C4. So the chain would have a plane of symmetry, making some of the CH2 groups equivalent.

Wait, let's count the signals in a straight six-carbon chain.

Structure: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN.

But wait, that's seven carbons if we count the C(O)CN as the seventh. Alternatively, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN, where the C(O)CN is at the end. So the chain is six carbons, each CH2.

In this case, the NMR signals would be:

- The two CH2 groups adjacent to the C(O)CN (positions 6 and 5): but in a straight chain, the end groups are equivalent, so their signals would be the same. Similarly, the internal CH2 groups would have different environments.

Wait, but in a straight chain, the two CH2 groups at the end are identical, so their Hs would be equivalent. Similarly, the two CH2 groups next to them (positions 4 and 5) would be equivalent. The middle CH2 groups (positions 3 and 4) would also be equivalent if the chain is symmetric.

Wait, for a six-carbon chain, the symmetry would be such that positions 1 and 6 are equivalent, positions 2 and 5 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 4 are equivalent. So the NMR would have three signals for the chain.

But wait, in this case, the chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN. So the first CH2 (position 1) is connected to the rest, and the last CH2 (position 6) is connected to the C(O)CN. Wait, no, the end is the C(O)CN, so the last CH2 is position 6, and it's attached to C(O)CN. So the first CH2 (position 1) is attached to position 2, and the last CH2 (position 6) is attached to position 5 and the C(O)CN.

In this scenario, the chain is not symmetric because the end (position 6) is attached to the carbonyl group, whereas position 1 is attached to position 2. So the symmetry is broken, meaning that each CH2 group would have a unique environment.

Wait, that can't be. If the chain is six carbons long and attached to the same group on both ends, then it would be symmetric. But in our case, the chain is attached to the C(O)CN group on one end and to the central carbon on the other. So no, it's not symmetric. Each CH2 group is in a unique environment.

So for a six-carbon chain attached to a functional group on one end, each CH2 group would give a different signal.

So the CH2 groups would have six different environments, leading to six signals. But wait, that can't be correct because adjacent CH2 groups would have similar environments.

Wait, perhaps the NMR would have the following signals:

1. The CH2 group directly attached to the C(O)CN (position 6): this is a terminal CH2, so it would be a triplet if next to a CH2, but perhaps a singlet or a different splitting. But more importantly, it's a distinct environment.

2. The next CH2 group (position 5): adjacent to position 6 and 4.

3. Position 4: adjacent to 5 and 3.

4. Position 3: adjacent to 4 and 2.

5. Position 2: adjacent to 3 and 1.

6. Position 1: adjacent to 2 and the central carbon.

So six distinct signals from the chain.

Additionally, the C(O)CN group itself doesn't have any hydrogens, so no signals from that.

So the total number of signals would be 6 from the chain. But wait, earlier steps could have added other groups. Let me re-examine the entire reaction.

Wait, product 4 is the final product after reacting product 3 (which is CH3C(O)CN) with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane. So the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN, with two pentyl groups attached to the alpha carbon.

In that case, each pentyl group has five CH2 groups. But because the molecule is symmetric, the CH2 groups in each pentyl chain would mirror each other.

So the NMR would have:

For each pentyl chain:

- Position 1 (attached to the central C): two CH2 groups, equivalent → one signal.

- Position 2: two CH2 groups, equivalent → one signal.

- Position 3: same → one signal.

- Position 4: same → one signal.

- Position 5 (terminal): same → one signal.

So five signals from each pentyl chain, but since the molecule is symmetric, each position's CH2 groups are equivalent, leading to five signals in total.

Additionally, the central CH2 group (if any) or the alpha Hs. Wait, no, the central carbon is attached to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a nitrile. So the central carbon (the alpha carbon) is a CH2 group? Or is it a CH group?

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CH-C(O)CN. So the central carbon is a CH group attached to two pentyl chains, a carbonyl, and a nitrile. But that doesn't make sense because a carbon can't have five bonds.

Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this.

The enolate is CH2- (from CH3C(O)CN). When it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, it adds a CH2 group to the alpha position. So the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN. Which is a six-carbon chain, with the C(O)CN at the end.

But in this case, the chain is symmetric only if the C(O)CN is at both ends, which it isn't. So each CH2 group in the chain is in a unique environment, leading to six signals from the chain.

But wait, the chain is six carbons long, but the C(O)CN is at one end. So the first CH2 (position 1) is attached to the rest of the chain, and the last CH2 (position 6) is attached to the C(O)CN. So the environments are different for each CH2 group.

So each of the six CH2 groups would have a unique signal in the NMR. But wait, in a straight chain, the middle CH2 groups would be equivalent. For example, in a six-carbon chain, positions 2 and 5 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 4 would be equivalent. So the NMR would have three signals from the chain: positions 1 (singlet), 2 and 5 (equivalent), 3 and 4 (equivalent), and 6 (singlet). Wait, not quite. Let me think about the actual structure.

The structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)CN.

So the CH2 groups are:

1: CH2 connected to C0 (the central carbon) and CH2-2.

2: CH2 connected to CH2-1 and CH2-3.

3: CH2 connected to CH2-2 and CH2-4.

4: CH2 connected to CH2-3 and CH2-5.

5: CH2 connected to CH2-4 and CH2-6.

6: CH2 connected to CH2-5 and C(O)CN.

In this case, the molecule isn't symmetric because the end (position 6) is attached to C(O)CN, whereas position 1 is attached to the central carbon.

So the environments of each CH2 group are distinct. Therefore, each CH2 would give a separate signal. So six signals from the chain.

Additionally, the C(O)CN group itself doesn't contribute any hydrogens, so no signal there.

But wait, the central carbon (C0) is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in this structure, C0 is connected to only one CH2 group (the first one in the chain). So perhaps the central carbon isn't part of the chain but is the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's try to think again.

The product 4 is formed by the alkylation of the enolate of product 3 (CH3C(O)CN) with 1,5-dibromopentane. So the enolate's CH2 attacks the Br in the dibromide, adding a five-carbon chain to the alpha position.

So the structure is:

(CH2)5CH-C(O)CN.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply a six-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(CH2)4CH2-C(O)CN, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)CH2-C(O)CN.

In any case, the NMR analysis is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach.

Assuming that product 4 has a structure with two pentyl groups attached to the same carbon, which is adjacent to a carbonyl and nitrile group, with the molecule being symmetric, the NMR would have:

- Each CH2 group in the pentyl chains contributing a unique signal.

But due to symmetry, the equivalent CH2 groups would give the same signal.

So, for each pentyl group, the CH2 groups are:

1: attached to the central carbon.

2: next to 1.

3: next to 2.

4: next to 3.

5: terminal.

In a symmetric molecule, the CH2 groups at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 would each be equivalent on both sides. So for each position, the two CH2 groups (one on each side) are identical, leading to five distinct signals from the two pentyl groups.

But wait, the terminal CH2 groups (position 5) on each side are identical, so their Hs are equivalent, contributing one signal.

Similarly, the position 4 CH2 groups on each side are identical → one signal.

Position 3: same → one signal.

Position 2: same → one signal.

Position 1: same → one signal.

So the two pentyl groups contribute 5 signals.

Additionally, the central CH2 group (if any) would contribute a signal. Wait, but in the structure (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN, the central C is connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a nitrile. So the central C is a quaternary carbon (no Hs), so no signal from there.

Additionally, the C(O)CN group has no Hs, so no signal.

So total signals are 5 from the pentyl chains.

But wait, each CH2 in the pentyl chains is part of a longer chain. Let me think about the splitting.

Each CH2 group in the chain would split depending on neighboring groups.

But for NMR purposes, the number of distinct environments determines the number of signals.

So, in the symmetric case, the two pentyl groups would each have five CH2 groups, but due to symmetry, each position's CH2 groups are equivalent, leading to five signals.

But wait, the central CH2 group (position 1) is connected to the central carbon, which is attached to the carbonyl and nitrile groups. So the environment of position 1's CH2 is unique. Similarly, position 2's CH2 has a different environment, etc.

So in the NMR, each CH2 group in the pentyl chains would have a unique chemical shift, leading to 5 signals for each pentyl group. But since the molecule is symmetric, each pair (from each pentyl group) contributes one signal.

So five signals from the two pentyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that each CH2 in the pentyl groups is unique, but in the symmetric molecule, some may be equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a single pentyl chain, leading to six signals (as in the earlier scenario). But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the options given.

The options are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

If the product has a single pentyl group (five CH2 groups), that's five signals. Plus any other Hs, like from the enolate's CH2 or the central carbon.

Wait, earlier steps: product 4 is formed by alkylation of product 3, which is CH3C(O)CN. So the enolate's CH2 is added to the dibromide. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN.

In this case, the chain is six CH2 groups (if I count correctly), but that's not right because 1,5-dibromopentane is five carbons. So the chain would be five carbons long. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(O)CN.

Wait, that can't be right because the enolate's CH2 adds to one end, making the chain five carbons long (from the dibromide) plus the enolate's CH2, making six. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)CH2-C(O)CN, which is a six-carbon chain. So each CH2 in the chain would have a unique environment, leading to six signals.

But the options don't have six as an option. The closest is option B)5, which would correspond to the five CH2 groups in a single pentyl chain. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a gem-dimethyl group, but that's not the case here.

Another possibility: perhaps the product is a cyclic structure, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a tertiary alcohol, but no, because the conditions are for alkylation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the enolate is a strong base and attacks both ends of the dibromide, leading to a single molecule with two pentyl groups attached to the same carbon.

So the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

In this case, each CH2 in the pentyl groups would have a unique environment, but due to symmetry, some would be equivalent.

The central carbon is a quaternary carbon, so no Hs there.

Each pentyl group has five CH2 groups. Due to symmetry, the Hs on the first CH2 (attached to the central C) are equivalent on both sides. Similarly, the Hs on the second CH2 are equivalent, etc.

So each position in the pentyl chain (positions 1 to 5) would have equivalent Hs on both sides, leading to five signals.

So the NMR would show five signals from the two pentyl groups.

But wait, what about the Hs on the central CH2? No, because the central C is quaternary.

So total signals would be five.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 5.

So the answer would be B)5.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with acetic acid, leading to a final product whose ¹H NMR spectrum is analyzed for distinct hydrogen signals. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction 1**: Acetic acid reacts with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride to form acetyl bromide (CH₃COBr). This is a nucleophilic acyl substitution where bromine replaces the hydroxyl group of acetic acid.

2. **Reaction 2**: Acetyl bromide reacts with ethanol and sulfuric acid to form ethyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₂CH₃). This is a classic esterification reaction.

3. **Reaction 3**: Ethyl acetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form acetonitrile (CH₃CN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) substitutes the ethoxy group (OCH₂CH₃) in a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

4. **Reaction 4**: Acetonitrile is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. NaH deprotonates the methyl group of acetonitrile, forming an enolate. The enolate undergoes an SN2 reaction with 1,5-dibromopentane, resulting in a symmetric product: (CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂)₂C(O)CN. This molecule has two identical pentyl chains attached to a central carbon, which is also bonded to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a nitrile group (CN).

### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum
The final product, (CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂)₂C(O)CN, is symmetric. Each pentyl chain contributes five CH₂ groups, and due to the molecule's symmetry, the hydrogens on equivalent CH₂ groups in the two chains are chemically identical. The environments of the CH₂ groups are as follows:

1. **Position 1 (CH₂ directly attached to the central carbon)**: Equivalent on both sides of the molecule → 1 signal.
2. **Position 2 (CH₂ next to Position 1)**: Equivalent on both sides → 1 signal.
3. **Position 3 (CH₂ next to Position 2)**: Equivalent on both sides → 1 signal.
4. **Position 4 (CH₂ next to Position 3)**: Equivalent on both sides → 1 signal.
5. **Position 5 (terminal CH₂)**: Equivalent on both sides → 1 signal.

Thus, the two pentyl chains contribute a total of **5 distinct signals** in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The central carbon (quaternary) and the C=O and CN groups do not contribute additional signals.

### Final Answer
The number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product is **5**.

Answer: B
