Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the notation like [Si/Fe] means the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of Si to Fe relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Oh wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the general formula is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

The given data for the stars:
- Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0.
- Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

And the Sun's composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, but wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me rephrase. The solar values are given as 12 + log10(n_X/nH) equals some number. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5. Similarly for Mg, it's 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5, so nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Now, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. That is, (n_Si, Star1 / n_Si, Star2) × (n_Si, Sun / n_Si, Sun) ? Wait no, the ratio would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2). But wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms, so n_Si,Star1 / n_Si,Star2.

Alternatively, maybe I should find n_Si for each star relative to the Sun, then take the ratio.

Let me think in terms of each star's [X/H] and [X/Y] values.

Starting with Star_1:

Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0. That means [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun =0. So log(n_Fe/n_H)_star1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So n_Fe, star1 / n_H, star1 = n_Fe, sun / n_H, sun
