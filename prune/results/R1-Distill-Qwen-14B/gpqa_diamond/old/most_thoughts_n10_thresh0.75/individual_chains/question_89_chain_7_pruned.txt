Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then it goes through several steps, and the goal is to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

Let me break down each step to understand what's happening.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with excess KOH at 240°C, it forms a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. The ¹H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). 

Hmm, thinking about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with bases, it's usually an elimination reaction, forming alkenes via the E2 mechanism. But wait, in the case of vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens), elimination would form an alkene. Alternatively, if the dihalide is not adjacent, but maybe in this case, the structure of adamantane has the two bromines in positions that when eliminated, form a double bond.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the base is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps there's more. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But substitution to what? Hmm. Wait, if KOH is used in a dehydrohalogenation, but the product has a carbonyl. Oh wait, perhaps it's an elimination followed by some other process.

Wait, no. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Or not? Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane rings. The positions 1 and 3 are probably on adjacent carbons. So if each Br is on adjacent
