Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitude has both real and imaginary parts, and these are related to the phase shifts in the scattering process.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored. The energy of the electrons is 50 MeV. I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. 

Wait, I think the formula for the scattering amplitude involves the sum over all the angular momentum states. The general expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over l of (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (something with Legendre polynomials?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Oh right, the full expression is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) [something divided by 1 - e^{2iδ_l}]... No, wait, that's not quite right. Or maybe it's f(θ) = sum (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l] / (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) P_l(cosθ)? No, wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^infty (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l (cosθ)

But wait, another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f(θ), is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l (cosθ). Because when you take the imaginary part, the exponential e^{iδ_l} gives sin δ_l. 

But wait, for the specific case when θ is 0 degrees, which is along the incident beam direction. Because the problem says "along the incident beam direction," so θ=0. So cosθ=1, and P_l(1) is known. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for
