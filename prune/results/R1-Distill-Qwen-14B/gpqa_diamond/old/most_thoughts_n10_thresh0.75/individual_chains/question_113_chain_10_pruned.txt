Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, the first thing I'll do is analyze each of the given spectroscopy data points.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The important peaks mentioned are a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1, and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1.

I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching. O-H in alcohols or carboxylic acids, maybe. But wait, if it's very broad, perhaps it's more like a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols have a broad peak too, but maybe the difference is in the other peaks.

The 1700 cm^-1 peak is a strong one. That's typically a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or an ester. What about 1650? I think that's a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Maybe an conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. Or perhaps an amide, but I don't see any data suggesting that.

So if there's a peak at 1700 and 1650, maybe it's an ester. Wait, esters usually have a strong peak around 1730-1750 for the carbonyl. Wait, but sometimes if conjugated or if it's an acid, maybe it's lower. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps in a ring or something else.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches that are very broad and strong. So that 3000 peak could be that. Then, the 1700 might be a carbonyl (C=O) from a carboxylic acid. But wait, carbox
