Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. That's something to do with the magnetic monopole thing, right?

Wait, Maxwell's equations... right, the four equations describe how electric and magnetic fields behave. Let me think about each equation. The first one is Gauss's law for electricity, which is about the divergence of the electric field. That's ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. I don't think that equation would change because it's about electric charges, not magnetic ones.

The second equation is Gauss's law for magnetism, which says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. So ∇·B = 0. Oh wait, if there are isolated magnetic poles (monopoles), then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because if you have a monopole, like a single north pole, the field lines would start at that pole, so the divergence would be non-zero. So in that case, instead of ∇·B = 0, it would be something like ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So that equation would definitely change.

The third equation is Faraday's law of induction. It states that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux. Mathematically, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. I think that this equation would still hold because it deals with how changing magnetic fields induce electric fields. The presence of magnetic monopoles might not affect this relation. Hmm, or does it? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Faraday's law is about the induced electric fields due to changing B. Magnetic monopoles would maybe change how B behaves, but I'm not sure if that equation itself changes. I'll come back to this.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition. It deals with the curl of the magnetic field and includes the displacement current. So ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. If there are magnetic currents (like if magnetic charge can move), then perhaps the equation would change. Wait, but Maxwell's equations as we know them don't include
