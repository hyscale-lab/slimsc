Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll think it through.

The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice orally. They used in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, because the stomach has a lot of acid, which might degrade some proteins or at least affect their structure. But some made it through and got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Then they looked at the Peyer patches, which I remember are these specialized areas in the intestinal mucosa, part of the immune system. They isolated the proliferating cells and sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, finding high variability.

So the question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A to D, all related to immune processes.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. That's a process where B cells mutate their antibody genes after activation, leading to more diverse antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. So when B cells proliferate and mutate, the variable regions change, increasing diversity. High variability in the variable heavy chain genes would fit this.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the immune response, especially the classical pathway where antibodies bind antigens and help lyse the pathogens. But I don't think it's about complement activation in this scenario. The question is about the process causing the high variability in the gene sequences.

Option C: Class switching recombination. That's when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG), which involves recombination of the heavy chain constant region. But this wouldn't directly cause variability in the variable regions; it affects the type of antibody but not the diversity in the antigen-binding site.

Option D: VDJ recombination. This is the process during B cell development where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. This occurs early in B cell development, in the bone marrow. But once a B cell is formed, the VDJ is fixed unless there's somatic hypermutation. So if they're seeing high variability after the initial immune response, it's probably not VDJ again because that would have happened earlier.

Wait, but in this case, the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are delivered, the mice mount an immune response, and the cells in the Peyer patches (which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue) are proliferating. Peyer patches are sites where antigens are sampled, and B cells there would be activated. Once activated, B cells undergo proliferation and differentiation, and during that time, they undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of the antibodies they produce.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is because of somatic hypermutation. That points to option A.

Other options: Complement activation (B) is more about the function of antibodies after they're made, not the variability in the genes. Class switching (C) doesn't affect the variable regions. VDJ (D) is about initial diversity but not the ongoing variation after an immune response.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence was observed to be destroyed by stomach acid and entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, were identified, and the proliferating cell population was isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells revealed high variability. 

To determine the process responsible for this variability, the following options were considered:

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation**  
  This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers. It involves the mutation of antibody genes, leading to increased diversity in the variable regions of the heavy chain. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes aligns with this process.

- **Option B: Complement activation**  
  This is a functional response of antibodies and complement proteins, not a mechanism that directly causes variability in the variable heavy chain genes. Therefore, it is not relevant to the observed phenomenon.

- **Option C: Class switching recombination**  
  This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) by recombining constant region genes. It does not affect the variable regions of the heavy chain, so it cannot explain the observed variability.

- **Option D: VDJ recombination**  
  This process occurs early in B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. However, this process occurs before the immune response and does not account for the variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, leading to increased diversity in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies. This matches the experimental observations.

Answer: A
