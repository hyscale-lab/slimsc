Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting velocities like in classical mechanics, right? Oh right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. I remember it's something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So the relative speed of B from A's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If we're calculating the speed of B as seen from A, which is moving at 0.6c in the same direction as B. So from A's frame, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), where v is A's speed relative to the original frame and u is B's speed. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The velocity of object B from the perspective of A is (u' - v) / (1 - (u' v)/c²), where u' is B's velocity in the original frame (which is 0.5c), and v is A's velocity (0.6c). So putting the numbers in.

So, u' is 0.5c, v is 0.6c. So numerator is 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c². Let's compute that denominator: 0.5*0.6 is 0.3, so 0.3 c² /
