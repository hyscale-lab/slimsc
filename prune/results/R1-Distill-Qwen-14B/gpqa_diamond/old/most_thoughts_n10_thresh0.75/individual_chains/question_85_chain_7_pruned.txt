Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question is a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, first, the setup. There are two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. So, it's a bit more massive and larger than our Sun, but the Teff is about the same as the Sun, which is 5778 K. Wait, no, 6300 K is a bit hotter than our Sun. That might affect the star's luminosity.

The planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably means their reflectivity is the same. They're in circular orbits.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature, I remember, is based on the energy balance. The formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, since both planets are around the same star and have the same albedo, the albedo terms would cancel when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures would depend on the square root of (R_star/(2a)) for each, but wait, actually, a is inversely proportional to the square root. Let me think again.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). Since both planets have the same A, the (1-A) term is the same for both, so when taking the ratio, that term cancels. So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R1/(2a1)) / (R2/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( (R1 a2) / (R2 a1) ) )

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2 a) ) ) * ( (1 - albedo
