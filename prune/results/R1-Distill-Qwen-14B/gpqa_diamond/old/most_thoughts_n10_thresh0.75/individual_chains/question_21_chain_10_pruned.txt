Okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of isomers and tautomerism. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It mentions two compounds, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and asks which one doesn't show tautomerism. Then, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, it asks which shows optical isomerism.

Let me break this down. Part A is about tautomerism. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds, leading to different structures. This usually happens in compounds with conjugated systems or where a hydrogen can move between adjacent atoms, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic dienone. It has two ketone groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. Wait, but wait, benzoquinone is actually a dihydroxybenzene that's lost two hydrogens to become a dienone. So the structure is like a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms double-bonded. So it's O=C6H4=C=O or something like that. But wait, no, benzoquinone is more accurately described as a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. So it's an aromatic compound with two ketone groups in para positions.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups. Positions 1,3,5, so they are all on the same ring, each separated by one carbon. So the structure would have three double bonds? Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Trione means three ketone groups. So the structure would have three ketone groups on adjacent carbons? Or maybe every other carbon. So 1,3,5, meaning each is two carbons apart. So the ring would have three ketone groups, each opposite each other? Wait, no, because 1,3,5 in a six-membered ring are all alternate positions. So they are in a trigonal arrangement, maybe like a chair conformation with three double bonds? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, each ketone is on a carbon. So each of the three carbons has a carbonyl group. So the structure is like O=C-O-C-O in a ring? No, wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5. So that's like three adjacent carbonyl groups? No, wait, no, because 1,3,5 are every other carbon. So the ring has three carbonyl groups spaced around.

Wait, but wait, can a cyclohexane ring have three ketone groups without being aromatic? I think cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds. So having three ketone groups would mean three carbonyl groups. But in such a structure, is there any possibility for conjugation that would allow
