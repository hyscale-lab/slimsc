Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem has two reactions, and I need to find the major products for each, then match them with the options given. Let's take them one at a time.

First Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (with t-BuOK) â†’ A

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with an enolate, it's usually an aldol addition or maybe some kind of cycloaddition. Wait, but ethyl acrylate is an ester; maybe this is a Michael addition? Or perhaps a conjugate addition?

Wait, no, wait. The starting material is a ketone, and the reagent is t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. So maybe it's an enolate formation. Enolates can attack other carbonyl compounds. So this is probably an aldol reaction.

But wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So maybe it's a conjugate addition, like a Michael addition. Oh, right, in the presence of a strong base, the ketone can form an enolate, which can then attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester in a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, the base could abstract a proton from the cyclohexanone to form an enolate, which would then attack the ethyl acrylate. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

Wait, let's think about the structure of the starting material. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). So the ketone is at position 1. The cyclohexane ring has substituents: at position 2, an ethyl group; position 6, a methyl group.

When t-BuOK is used, a strong, bulky base, it likely deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. But where are the alpha protons? The alpha carbons are next to the ketone group. The positions adjacent to C1 are C2 and C12 (since it's a ring, numbering is cyclical). Wait, C1 is the carbonyl, so the adjacent carbons are C2 (which has an ethyl group) and C6 (which has a methyl group). So, the alpha protons are on C2 and C6.

But wait, formation of enolates depends on which protons are more acidic and where the base can abstract them. Bulky bases like t-BuOK tend to form the more substituted enolates because they can't reach the less accessible protons easily. So, steric hindrance plays a role here.

The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So, the ketone is at C1. So, the carbons adjacent are C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups?), wait no. Let me draw this mentally. The cyclohex
