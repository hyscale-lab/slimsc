Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about mutations in a gene responsible for an anti-nutritional compound in barley. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that there's a gene with five exons and four introns. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutations in exons could potentially affect the protein product. The problem is this gene produces a compound that's bad, so we want to eliminate it. So I'm guessing we need to find a mutation that disrupts the gene function.

They used EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations, often leading to missense mutations (changing an amino acid) or nonsense mutations (premature stop codons). Looking at the sequences, the changes are at the beginning of the first exon.

Looking at the wild-type (intact) gene sequence:

5’-ATG TTT CTG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’

Wait, wait, maybe I should write it without the spaces for clarity. Let me see each exon is probably in the sequence, but since exons are parts that stay after splicing, the introns would be the spliced out parts. But the question says mutations are in the first exon, so all the options would be in the coding region.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAA... etc. Hmm, I see a T changed to A in the third codon? Let me parse the sequences.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for where the differences are. Let's compare each mutant to the wild type.

Wild type first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Looking at the first part, Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT… 

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TTCT… Hmm, so in the first few codons:

Wild has TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant 1: TTT CT A CGC TGG? Wait, let me look again. Wait, the wild type is 5' ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: 5' ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TTCT...

So the third codon in Wild: TTT. Next codon is CT C (so that would be CTC). Wait, perhaps it's better to look for each position.

Alternatively, perhaps the differences are in the third codon. Let me compare each codon.

Wait, perhaps the changes are in the first few codons.

In the wild type, the first part is ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), etc. 

Mutant 1: ATG, then TTT, then CTA (Leu?), then CGC (Arg?), because the third codon is CTA, and fourth is CGC.

Wait, the wild type's third codon is CTC (Leu), and Mutant 1's third is CTA (still Leu, since CTA is another Leu codon). Hmm, so same amino acid. Then the fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant 1, it's CGC (Arg), which is a different amino acid. So that would be a missense mutation.

Mutant 2: ATG TTT CT A AGC TGG TAC TTCT...

Wait, in the wild, after TTT, it's CTC GCT... So in
