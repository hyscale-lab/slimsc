Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is split by two neighboring protons. Wait, no, wait. The splitting depends on the number of neighboring Hs. So a triplet would be from two adjacent Hs, meaning one neighboring group with two Hs. Or wait, the n+1 rule. So a triplet is from two neighboring groupsâ€”each H is next to two others. Or maybe I'm mixing that up.

Wait, for a triplet, the integration is for 6H. Let me think. Maybe it's a set of equivalent protons. Like, perhaps a methyl group attached to something that's next to another CH2. Because a triplet in a methyl group would suggest that each methyl proton is next to two others. Wait, wait. No, maybe it's a methyl group next to a CH2. So, for example, a CH2CH2CH3 structure. Let me think: if it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the triplet. If 6H is a triplet, perhaps it's two equivalent methyl groups each attached to a CH2. Because each methyl group is next to a CH2 with two Hs. So each methyl's triplet would be from the neighboring CH2. So maybe the structure for the 6H is two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. So the triplet at 0.9 ppm could be two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. But wait, that would be 6H in total (each CH3 has 3H, two of them make 6H). So the CH2 would be next to each CH3. But then, the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H. Quartet implies each H is split into four, which would suggest each H has three neighboring Hs. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Because a quartet would come from a CH2 next to another CH2. Wait, yeah, because the two Hs on a CH2 would split each other into a triplet, but if they're next to another CH2, maybe that's where the quartet comes from. Wait, no, the quartet in NMR for a CH2CH2 would be a quartet. Let me think: if you have a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, each H in the first CH2 would
