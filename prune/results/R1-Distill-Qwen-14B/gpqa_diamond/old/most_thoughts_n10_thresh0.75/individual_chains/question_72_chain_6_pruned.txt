Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, I've got an organic chemistry problem here, and honestly, it's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a product, and then we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, product 4. The options are A) 8, B) 4, C) 10, D) 7.

First, I'll try to break down each reaction step to understand what's happening.

The first reaction is between 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide at elevated temperature. The product is product 1.

Hmm. So, I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile, yielding a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is a bicycloheptadiene, which is a bridged bicyclic compound. So, the diene part is part of the bicyclo structure. The other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That molecule has two dienophiles, each with a dibromomethyl group attached.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The dienophile is usually something like a dienophile, which is an electron-deficient molecule, like a carbonyl or a nitrile. But in this case, the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile? Or is it the bicycloheptadiene acting as the diene?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene: it has two double bonds? No, cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it's a conjugated diene. So, perhaps it's the diene here. But that would mean the other molecule is the dienophile.

Wait, no. Wait, the diene is the conjugated diene, and the dienophile is a molecule with a triple bond, or a good electron-deficient double bond, like a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The first reactant is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene with substituents. So the structure
