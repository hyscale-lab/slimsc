Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, let's see... I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says the compound is a white solid. The mass spec shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100%, and another peak at 158 (32%). Wait, molecular ion usually is the molecular weight, right? So the molecular weight is 156. But then there's a peak at 158, which is two more. That makes me think about possible isotopes or maybe a chlorine atom because chlorine has a mass around 35, but adding two... Oh, maybe it's a chlorine in the structure. Chlorine has a common isotope at 35 and 37, so if the molecule has one Cl, the molecular ion would have two peaks, 35 and 37. But wait, the molecular ion is at 156, and the other is 158. That's a difference of 2. So 35Cl is 35, 37Cl is 37. So 156 for Cl-35, and 158 for Cl-37? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think. The M+ is at 156, but with a chlorine, the exact mass would have two peaks. Hmm, but wait, the molecular weight is 156. If the formula includes Cl, then Cl's atomic weight is about 35.5, so if the molecular weight is 156, what's the rest?

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see the formula. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If it's substituted with Cl and OH. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2? Because 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have Cl, OH, and the aldehyde group. So the molecular weight would be (7*12) + (5*1) + 35.5 (Cl) + (2*16 for O). Let me calculate: 84 +5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32 (O2)=156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, maybe the formula isn't exact. Or perhaps it's due to rounding. Alternatively, maybe it's benzoic acid with Cl.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula is C7H5ClO2. Same calculation as above: 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. Again, close to 156. The molecular ion is at 156, perhaps the exact mass is 156.5, but maybe the instrument measures around 156. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, but the molecule actually weighs 156. Maybe we're looking at a molecular formula with a molecular weight of 156, but perhaps Cl is involved.

Wait, the mass spec has a peak at 158, which is 2 higher than 156. That might be the M+2 peak for chlorine. So if the molecular weight is 156, and the M+2 is 158, then the molecule contains a chlorine atom. Because Cl has a natural abundance of about 75% for Cl-35 and 25% for Cl-37. So the M peak would be Cl-35 (35), and M+2 would be Cl-37 (37). So the ratio of M to M+2 would be roughly 3:1, because Cl is present once. The M is 156 and the M+2 is 158, and their percentages are 100% and 32%. Let me check the ratios: 100% for M, 32% for M+2. So 32 is roughly a third of 100, which fits with the 3:1 ratio expected for chlorine. So that suggests that the molecule has one chlorine atom. So that would make sense.

So the molecular formula probably includes Cl. Let's consider the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight is 12*7 +5 +35.5 +16*2 = 84 +5=89; 89+35.5=124.5; 124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular weight around 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156, which is just a bit lower. Maybe it's a mistake or the exact mass is considered.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid: same formula as A, C7H5ClO2. Same molecular weight.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is O=C(OCl)OPh? Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O- attached to something else. Wait, phenyl chloroformate would be ClCOOPh? So the formula would be C6H5COOCl. Let's compute that: C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as the others. Molecular weight same as A and B. So all three options (A, B, C, D) have same formula? Wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as B, so same molecular weight. So all the options except perhaps C may have same molecular formula, but C is phenyl chloroformate. Let me see:

Phenyl chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2 (since C6H5 is 6 carbons, COO adds two more, Cl adds one more. Hmm, same formula as the others. So maybe all have same formula? Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is phenyl chloroformate. The formula is C7H5ClO2. So same as A, B, D. So the mass spec data just tells us the molecular weight, which doesn't help differentiate the options. So we need to look at other data.

Next, the IR data. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Because O-H in alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, etc., show broad absorption. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. The exact position can help. A carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is typically around 1700 cm^-1, maybe a bit lower. An ester or acid chloride is higher, maybe around 1720-1740. So 1720 would fit an acid chloride or possibly an ester. Wait, but in
