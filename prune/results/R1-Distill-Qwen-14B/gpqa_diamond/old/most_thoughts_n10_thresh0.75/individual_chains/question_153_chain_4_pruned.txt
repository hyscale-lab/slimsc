Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each, and then match them to the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt in EtOH as the conditions.

Wait, what's a Michael addition? From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (like an enolate) to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So the enolate attacks the beta position of the Michael acceptor, which is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In this case, dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile. Dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl, and it's a good source of an enolate. When it deprotonates, it forms an enolate which can attack the beta position of another compound.

The other component here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at position 3. Wait, actually, the (E) configuration would mean the substituents on the double bond are opposite. Hmm.

Wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So the position numbering: the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the carbonyl is on C3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be that the substituent is on the C3, but that doesn't make sense because the carbonyl is already there. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CO-O-p-tolyl? No, I think it's CH2=CH-CO-O-p-tolyl. No, wait, acrylate is an ester, so the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-R, where R is p-tolyl. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the carbonyl on C3, and the ester group is on C4.

Wait, maybe it's methyl ester of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent (p-tolyl) on the double bond. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-3
