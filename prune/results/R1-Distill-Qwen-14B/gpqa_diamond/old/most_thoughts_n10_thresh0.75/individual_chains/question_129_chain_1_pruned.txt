Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are some hints given. Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So this reaction is probably a Wittig reaction. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, the substituents on the cyclopentane are 1,2-dimethyl and a propenyl group at position 4.

So, the Wittig reaction usually converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So compound A must be a ketone because the product is an alkene. Let me draw that product structure. The cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached. So the structure is a cyclopentane with substituents at 1, 2, and 4 positions. The substituent at 4 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2-? Wait, no. The structure of propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)-, but wait, the ylidene would have a double bond. So propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2=C(CH3)-, so the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl branch. So the Wittig reaction product is a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups on adjacent carbons (1 and 2) and at C4, a substituent that's a vinyl group attached to a methyl (so maybe CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.)

But the key point is that the Wittig reaction forms a double bond. So compound A must have a carbonyl group that's part of a ring. Because the product is a cyclopentane with an exocyclic double bond. So the starting material (compound A) might be a cyclopentanone? Because when you do a Wittig reaction with a ketone, you get an alkene.

Wait, but the Wittig adds a double bond. So cyclopentanone reacting with a ylide would give cyclopentane with an exocyclic double bond. But in this case, the product is a dimethyl-substituted cyclopentane with another substituent. So perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents that, upon Wittig reaction, lead to the given product.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2 (methyl), and 4 (propan-2-ylidene). So in the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl must have been at position 4 of the cyclopentane. Because when the ylide attacks the carbonyl, it forms a new double bond. So if the carbonyl is at position 4, the ylide would add across it, creating a double bond
