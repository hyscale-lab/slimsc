Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by carefully reading the question.

The question says that we've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound, which has a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and an aromatic-halogen bond, so there must be a halogen substituent on the ring.

So, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Let's think about the possible structures. The total carbon count is 8. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, no: wait, the ring itself is 6 carbons, and the substituents bring the total to 8, so the substituents contribute 2 carbons in total.

Wait, no. Wait, no. The molecule is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so the ring has 6 carbons. The substituents are two groups attached to the ring. So the total number of carbons in the entire molecule is 8. So the substituents contribute 2 carbons. Let me see: if each substituent is a single carbon, then two substituents would add two carbons. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a two-carbon group and the other is a halogen, but wait, that would make the total carbons 6 (ring) + 2 (from substituent) + 0 (halogen is not carbon) = 8. Wait, because the substituents are two groups on the ring. So, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait: a carbonyl group is a double bond. So perhaps one substituent is a ketone (like a carbonyl attached via an oxygen, but that would require more carbons), or maybe it's a halogen (like Cl or Br) and another group which has a carbonyl.

Let me think. The substituents are two groups on the benzene ring. So the possibilities are:

Substituent 1: X (like Cl, Br, etc.)
Substituent 2: R group that contains a carbonyl.

But wait, the total carbons are
