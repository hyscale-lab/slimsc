Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and honestly, it's a bit overwhelming at first glance, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm going to think through it as if I'm just starting to learn this stuff, because maybe that'll help me understand better.

The problem is about heating a mixture of two salts, A and B. They're equimolar, so their moles are equal. The total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through some tubes, and based on the weight changes, we can figure out what the gases are.

Let me jot down the key information:

- Salts A and B are heated. Only gases form; no solid or liquid remains. So all the salts decompose into gases.
- The gases pass through three tubes:
  1. Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. It gained 3.60 grams.
  2. Tube №2: Ca(OH)2 solution. No change in weight.
  3. Tube №3: Red-hot copper. Gained 0.80 grams, forming CuO. 

And after that, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure (STP).

The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let's think about each step.

First, what's happening in each tube.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. It probably absorbs water. So when the gas mixture passes through, any water vapor would be absorbed, increasing the tube's weight. The increase is 3.60 grams, which likely corresponds to the mass of water.

Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. If it absorbs water, it would form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, right? So the increase in mass is the mass of the water that was absorbed. So 3.60 grams of H2O.

So that suggests that the gas mixture contains water vapor, which is removed here. So H2O is one of the gases.

Moving on to tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If any CO2 is present, it would react with the solution. The reaction would be CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3↓ + H2O. So the Ca(OH)2 solution would gain mass due to the CO2. But the problem says the weight of the second tube hasn't changed. So this implies that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. Because if there was CO2, the tube would have reacted and gained mass. But since it didn't, probably no CO2 in the gases.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the solution was already saturated or something else. But the simplest explanation is that there's no CO2.

Then tube 3: Red-hot copper. So the gas that reacts here is likely carbon monoxide (CO), which would react with copper oxide. The reaction is 2CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80 grams. Let's calculate how much CO was absorbed.

The reaction produces Cu, and the mass difference comes from the oxygen in CuO replacing the CO. Alternatively, the mass gained is due to the oxygen from the CO.

Wait, let's think about the molar masses. Let's see, the reaction is 2 CO → 2 CO2 (in the presence of CuO, which is a catalyst perhaps?), but that might not be correct. Wait, no, the actual reaction is CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. So each CO molecule contributes to the oxygen in CuO.

Wait, more accurately, each CO molecule reacts with CuO to produce Cu and CO2. So the mass change can be calculated based on the oxygen in the CO.

Wait, let's think of it this way: each mole of CO that reacts adds one mole of O to the copper, turning it into CuO. So the mass increase is due to the O in the CO.

Wait, let's get into the stoichiometry:

Molar masses:
- CO: 28 g/mol (12 +16)
- O:16 g/mol

Each mole of CO contributes one O atom to the CuO, so the mass gained per mole of CO is 16 g.

So the mass increase is 0.80 grams. So moles of O = 0.80 /16 = 0.05 moles. So moles of CO = 0.05 mol.

So, 0.05 moles of CO were present in the gas.

But wait, wait. Because the reaction is 2CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. So for each 2 moles of CO, we get 1 mole of CO2. But the mass change is
