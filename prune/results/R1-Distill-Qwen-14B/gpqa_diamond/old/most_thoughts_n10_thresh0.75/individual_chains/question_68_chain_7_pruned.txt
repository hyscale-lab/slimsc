Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have magnetic moments, right? The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. So mu = γ S_z. 

The setup is that the magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. So the magnetic field is B in the z-direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. Now, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. So initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z, so its spin is aligned with Z. Then the field switches to Y. I remember when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The energy eigenstates will change, leading to time evolution of the state.

Wait, the initial state must be the eigenstate of S_z before the field change. Since the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, the state is probably |↑⟩ along Z, which is (1, 0) in the spinor notation.

After the field is turned off and then on in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic field is along Y, the Zeeman term is proportional to S_y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. Wait, wait, the magnetic dipole interaction energy is typically H = -μ·B. But since μ is given as γ S_z, and here the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian should be H = -γ B S_y. Wait, but sometimes the sign conventions can vary. Maybe the Hamiltonian is H = γ B S_y? Hmm, not sure about the sign, but I suppose the key is that the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

So the state after the change is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the system will evolve over time, and the expectation values of various observables will oscillate.

The question asks specifically about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. So ⟨S_z⟩ as a function of time. But wait, the magnetic moment is mu = γ S_z, so the average of the z-component of mu is γ⟨S_z⟩. So if I find the frequency of ⟨S_z⟩, that's the key.

I think I need to find the time dependence of ⟨S_z⟩. For that, I need to find how the state evolves under the new Hamiltonian H = γ B S_y (or something like that, maybe the sign is different).

Let me model the time evolution. The initial state is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑_z⟩ = (1, 0)^T. The Hamiltonian after the change is H = ω S_y, where ω is some frequency. Wait, let me get the exact expression. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S·B. Since B is along Y, H = -γ B S_y. But I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let me think: the energy of a dipole in a field is U = -μ·B. So μ = γ S_z, but when B is along Y, μ·B becomes γ S_z * B in Y direction? Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is a vector, so if B is along Y, the dot product would involve S_y. Because μ = γ S, so μ·B = γ B S_y. So U = -μ·B = -γ B S_y. So H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but sometimes, the Hamiltonian is written as H = γ B S·B, without the negative. I might get the sign wrong here. Let me think again. The magnetic dipole energy is U = -μ·B. So H = -μ·B. Since μ is γ S_z, but wait no, μ is the vector, so it's γ times the vector S. So μ = γ S. So H = -γ S · B. When B is along Y, this becomes H = -γ B S_y.

Alternatively, maybe the sign doesn't matter for the frequency, just the magnitude. Let's proceed.

So, the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. Since S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y, so H can be rewritten as H = -(γ B ħ / 2) σ_y.

But for a spin-1/2 system, S_y has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues will be ± (γ B ħ /
