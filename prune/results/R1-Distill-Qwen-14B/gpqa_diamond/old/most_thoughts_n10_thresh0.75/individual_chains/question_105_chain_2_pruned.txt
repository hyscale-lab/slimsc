Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed. Then, they're asking about the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same signal as these spots.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is the same as R_sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. They observe brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots into our view. This setup can look like an exoplanet transit. So, the question is, what exoplanet radius would give the same brightness dip as these spots do?

Wait, but if the star wasn't spotted, what would cause the same signal? The exoplanet's transit would block some light. So I need to compare the dip caused by the spots to that of an exoplanet transit.

Wait, but wait. Hmm, the star's brightness variation due to spots and the planet's transit are both dips in brightness, but their causes are different. The spots cause a dip because they are cooler, so when they come into view, the overall brightness decreases. But when a planet transits, it blocks the star's light, also causing a dip.

Wait, but the problem says the situation resembles an exoplanet. So, the spot-induced dip is similar to a planet transit. Now, the question is to find the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spot-induced variation.

Wait, but the amplitude here isn't just a simple area blockage. Because the spots are cooler, their effect on brightness is a bit more involved. So, I think I need to calculate the change in flux due to the spots and compare that to the change from a planetary transit.

Let me think about the star's flux. The star emits with a certain flux, and the spots contribute less. So the total flux when the spots are visible is lower.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT^4. But since the star is not uniform, we have to consider the spots.

So the star
