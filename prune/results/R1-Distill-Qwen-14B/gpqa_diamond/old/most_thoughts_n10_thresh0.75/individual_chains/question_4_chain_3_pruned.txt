Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate a single pole because they're bound together. So the question is about how Maxwell's equations would change if that weren't the case.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total. They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and relate to each other. Let me recall them. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E is rho over epsilon zero.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is negative the time derivative of B.
4. Amp√®re's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of B is mu zero times J plus epsilon zero mu zero times the time derivative of E.

Right, in our universe, the second equation (Gauss's Law for magnetism) says that the divergence of B is zero. That implies that there are no isolated magnetic charges, like how there are electric charges. So, if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles, that would mean that magnetic monopoles exist.

So Maxwell's equations would have to change to account for this. Let me think: if magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So Equation 2 would change.

Wait, but what about Faraday's Law? In our world, the curl of E is -dB/dt. If there were magnetic charges, would that affect Faraday's Law? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think that if you have magnetic monopoles, then the curl of B might change as well. Because in our equations, both the divergence and the curl of B are governed by Maxwell's equations.

Wait, another point: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B would be rho_m / epsilon_0 or something like that. But also, the divergence of E is rho_e / epsilon_0. So if magnetic monopoles exist, we would have sources and sinks for B just like for E.

So, Maxwell's equations would have to be modified in two places. Let me think: The
