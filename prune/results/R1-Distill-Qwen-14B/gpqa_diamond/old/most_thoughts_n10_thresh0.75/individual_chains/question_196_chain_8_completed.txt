Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, and they involve expressions with c, the speed of light.

Wait, but in the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m). Oh right, because the potential energy at maximum displacement converts into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m). So that's option C. But wait, the question is about a relativistic oscillator, so I can't just use the classical formula.

Right, because in relativity, the equations change. The problem is relativistic, so I need to consider relativistic mechanics. In special relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic anymore. The total energy includes rest mass energy.

So the potential energy in the relativistic case is still (1/2)kA², assuming that the maximum displacement is A. But the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point, where the potential energy is zero. At maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, so E = rest energy + kinetic energy at equilibrium.

Wait, no. Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, when the mass is at the maximum displacement (amplitude A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. When it's at the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic. So in the classical case, E = (1/2)mv_max² + (1/2)kA², but because energy is conserved, they are equal. So (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max².

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)m v²; it's something else. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So wait, the total energy E would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. At x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc². Because in the relativistic case, the rest energy is mc², and when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential (assuming no kinetic energy there).

Then, when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So E = mc² + kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy at equilibrium is (1/2)kA², because E is the same.

Wait, no. Wait, in the classical case, E is (1/2)kA² because the potential and kinetic are equal. But in the relativistic case, E is higher because it includes the rest energy. Wait, not necessarily. Let me think again.

Wait, in the relativistic scenario, the total energy (which includes rest mass energy) must be conserved. So at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc². At x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy is kinetic energy plus rest energy.

Wait, no. Wait, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy in the rest frame. So E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. So at x=0, E = mc² + K_max. But also, E = (1/2)kA² (from x=A, where K is zero). So:

E = (1/2)kA² + mc² (at x=A) = mc² + K_max (at x=0)

So,

(1/2)kA² = K_max.

Wait, but K_max is the relativistic kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) mc². So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

We can solve for gamma.

Gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)

Because:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc²

Multiply both sides by 2/(mc²):

kA²/(m c²) ) = 2 (gamma -1)/1

Wait, wait:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc²

Then,

gamma -1 = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a term for simplicity. Let's call this term t.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + t

Take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + t )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + t )²

Rearranged,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + t )²

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + t )² ]

But t is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so:

v² = c² [1 -1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))² ]

Take square root:

v = c sqrt [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))² ]

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see.

Option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which matches what I just derived. So D is the correct expression.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because earlier, I thought that the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which is correct in the classical case. But in the relativistic case, does the potential energy change? I think for small oscillations, the potential is approximately (1/2)kx², but I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption here.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. So potential energy is (1/2)kx². So that part remains the same. Then, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², which is correct.

So, the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc² when the particle is at x=A. Then, when it's at x=0, all that energy is converted into kinetic, which in this case is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Thus, the approach is correct. So the maximum speed is given by option D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. In the relativistic regime, the total energy \( E \) includes both the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the kinetic energy. 

At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all the energy is potential energy, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 \). At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic. The kinetic energy in special relativity is expressed as \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at both points, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 = mc^2 + (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]
Simplifying, the rest energy \( mc^2 \) cancels out, leaving:
\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]
Solving for \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]
Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]
Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]
Rearranging for \( v^2 \):
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]
This matches the expression in option D. The other options are incorrect because they either use classical mechanics (option C) or introduce incorrect relativistic corrections.
