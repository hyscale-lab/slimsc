Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all acetates with different substituents, either propenyl or butenyl, and either cis or trans configurations.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quartets
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm. That's a common region for an acetate group. The singlet suggests that the three protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. So, that's probably the OAc (acetyl) group. Acetate groups in esters usually show up around 2 ppm as a singlet because the three CH3 protons are all equivalent and there's no splitting.

Next, the doublet at 7.0 ppm. That's a downfield region, so probably aromatic protons. Wait, but wait—these are not from an aromatic ring because the options are alkenes. Oh, right, in alkenes, the protons on the double bond can show up in the 5-7 ppm region. But wait, a doublet with J=16 Hz—that's a large coupling, which suggests a trans coupling. Because cis coupling (like vicinal coupling) can also be around 10-18 Hz, but trans is usually larger. Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, wait. For double bonds, the coupling between the two protons (cis or trans) would be around 10-18 Hz. So a J of 16 is in that range. So maybe that's a vinyl proton.

Wait, but the 7.0 ppm is a bit high for a vinyl proton. Hmm. Let me think. Acetates with propenyl or butenyl groups. Let's think about the structures.

The possible compounds are propenyl acetates and butenyl acetates. Let's consider the structures:

Cis-propenyl acetate: Structure would be CH2CH2OAc but wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but as an ester, it's OAc-O-CH2CHCH2? No, wait, the structure is more like CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe the double bond is in the middle.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So propenyl would be CH2CHCH2, but as an ester. So propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2OAc, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should draw the structures.

Wait, more accurately, the general structure for propenyl acetate is CH2CH2OAc with a double bond. Wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- (but
