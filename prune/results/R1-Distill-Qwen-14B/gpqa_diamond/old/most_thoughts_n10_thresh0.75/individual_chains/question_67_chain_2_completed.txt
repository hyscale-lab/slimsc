Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 and l2. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, the total angular momentum l is 2, and m is -1.

Wait, I remember that the total angular momentum L is the sum of the individual angular momenta, L = L1 + L2. The state is a coupled state, so it's an eigenstate of L², Lz. But the question is about measuring L1z and L2z individually.

The question asks for the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both eigenvalues are -ħ. So, each L1z and L2z would have eigenvalues of -ħ * their respective m values? Wait, no, because L1z is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for the first electron. For an electron in a p-orbital, l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So the eigenvalues for L1z and L2z would be m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, right?

So for each electron, L1z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. Same for L2z.

In this state |1,1,2,-1>, what are the possible m1 and m2 values that add up to m = -1?

Wait, because Lz = L1z + L2z, so m = m1 + m2. Here m is -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-2,... wait, no, wait m can't be less than -1 because each m is at least -1. So for m1 and m2, each can be -1, 0, or +1.

So the possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

(-1, 0) → because -1 + 0 = -1.

(0, -1) → same.

And are there any others? What about (-2, +1)? No, because each m is at least -1, so the maximum negative sum is -2, but that would require m1=-1 and m2=-1, which sums to -2, but we need sum -1. So the only possibilities are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, but wait a second, another possibility: let me list all possible m1 and m2 combinations that add up to -1.

m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

Similarly for m2.

So let's see:

m1=-1, m2=0 → sum -1 → yes.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1 → yes.

m1=+1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2. So no.

Similarly, m1 can't be anything else without making m2 go beyond -1.

So only two possible pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, but wait, the state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So this state is a combination of the individual states of the two electrons.

Wait, but electrons are fermions, so the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But since we're considering only the orbital angular momentum part here, maybe I don't need to worry about spin. The question says 'ignoring spin angular momentum' so perhaps we don't have to consider the Pauli exclusion here. Hmmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the question specifically says to ignore spin, so perhaps the state is just the product of their angular momenta states.

Wait, but when you have two particles, the coupled state can be expressed in terms of the product states. So the |1,1,2,-1> state can be expanded as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of these two product states.

But how?

Hmm, for two angular momenta coupling, the states can be built from the product states. The |l1, l2, l, m> states are expressed as a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m.

So, for l=2 and m=-1, the state is a combination of (m1, m2) where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sum_{m1 + m2 = -1} [ coefficients ] |m1> |m2>.

In this case, the coefficients for m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

Wait, but what are the coefficients? I think I remember that for two l=1 particles, the possible total l can be 2, 1, 0.

For each l, the m values range from -l to +l in steps of 1.

For l=2, m can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2.

The state |1,1,2,-1> corresponds to the coupled state with total angular momentum 2 and m=-1.

The expansion of this state in terms of the product states is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states to get l=2, m=-1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2, m=-1 are the same as for combining two spin-1 particles.

So the formula is:

|l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> = sum_{m1, m2} [ CG coefficients ] |m1, m2>,

where m1 + m2 = M = -1.

The coefficients can be found in tables or from the formula.

I think the CG coefficients for adding two l=1 to get L=2 are:

For each M from -2 to +2:

The coefficients are:

For M=2: (m1=1, m2=1) → coefficient sqrt(1/3).

For M=1: (m1=1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=1). The coefficient for each would be sqrt(1/6).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think.

The general formula for the CG coefficients when combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M is:

|l1, m1; l2, m2> → |L, M> = sum CG coefficients * |l1 m1> |l2 m2>.

Alternatively, the expansion is:

|L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ CG(l1, l2, L, M; m1, m2) ] |l1 m1> |l2 m2>.

For our case, l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

What are the CG coefficients for this?

I remember that for two spin-1 particles, the state |2, -1> is a combination of the product states |1, -1> |1, 0>, and |1, 0> |1, -1>.

Wait, no, because m1 + m2 = M.

So for M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

So the state |2, -1> is a combination of these two.

The CG coefficient for each of these can be found. I think the coefficient for each is sqrt(1/2), but I might be wrong.

Wait, let me recall the formula for CG coefficients for combining two l=1's into L=2.

The general formula for CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2:

The state |L=2, M> is a sum over m1 and m2 with m1 + m2 = M.

The coefficients are:

For M=2: only (1,1) → coefficient sqrt(1/3).

For M=1: (1,0) and (0,1), each with coefficient sqrt(1/6).

For M=0: (1,-1), (0,0), (-1,1), each with coefficient sqrt(1/3), but wait no, I think M=0 has more terms.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the |L=2, M= -1> state.

The state |2, -1> can be written as a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

Which are the states |1, -1> |1, 0> and |1, 0> |1, -1>.

So, the state |2, -1> is a combination of these two product states.

The coefficients for these are:

√(1/2) each.

Wait, wait, because when you combine two spin-1 particles, the state |2,1> is (|1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1>) / sqrt(2), right?

Wait, no, perhaps the coefficients depend on M and the possible combinations.

Alternatively, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2, M=-1 would be:

The coefficient for |m1= -1, m2=0> is sqrt(1/2), and the same for |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So,

|2, -1> = (|m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the normalization.

The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.

Each term contributes (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. So two terms sum to 1/2 +1/2 =1. So yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the state |2, -1> is an equal superposition of the two product states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So the state in the problem is this |2, -1> state, which is a combination of these two.

Now, the question is, what is the probability that measuring L1z and L2z both give -ħ.

Wait, L1z is the z-component of the first electron's orbital angular momentum. So for the first electron, when in state |m1=-1>, L1z has eigenvalue -ħ. Similarly, for m2=-1, L2z is -ħ.

So the product state where both are in m=-1 would have L1z = L2z = -ħ.

But wait, in our expansion, do we have such a state?

No, because in the expansion of |2,-1>, the product states are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

Neither of these has both m1 and m2 equal to -1.

So the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

Because the state is a combination of |(-1,0) and (0,-1), which don't include the state where both are -1.

So the probability is zero.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the total $z$-component of angular momentum. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring the $z$-components of the orbital angular momenta $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for both electrons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Expansion**: The coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states $|m_1, m_2\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the $z$-components of the orbital angular momenta of the two electrons. Since $m = m_1 + m_2 = -1$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are:
   - $(-1, 0)$
   - $(0, -1)$

   These pairs are combined with Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For $|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$, the state is an equal superposition of the two product states:
   \[
   |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \right).
   \]

2. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are determined by $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, with eigenvalues $m_1 \hbar$ and $m_2 \hbar$. To have both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ equal to $-\hbar$, we need $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, this product state $(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1)$ is not present in the expansion of $|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$.

3. **Probability Calculation**: Since the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$ does not include the product state $(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1)$, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for both electrons is $0$.
