Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let me think about what I know.

The problem says that the anti-nutritional compound is made because of a gene. They found the gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations, usually by adding methyl groups to DNA bases, leading to changes like transitions (like C to T or G to A) which can cause missense mutations.

The wild-type gene sequence is given, and each mutant shows some changes in the first exon. I need to look at the mutations and see which one would disrupt the gene's function, probably leading to a non-functional compound, hence eliminating it.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the wild type.

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant 1:
ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the start, the wild type has TTCTCGC. Mutant 1 has TTCTACG. Let me see the exact change. Wait, the wild is TTCT C G C. Wait, maybe the start is: ATG T T C T C G C T G G T... Hmm. Let me compare each part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the sequences aligned.

Let me write the wild type and each mutant.

Wild type starts:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1:
ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA-3’
Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe I should compare each position.

Looking at the first part:

Wild type: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, so the change is in the 4th position of that segment. For the wild type, positions 5-10 perhaps are T C G C T G, while in mutant 1, it's T A C G C T. Hmm, so the 5th base changes from C to A? Or maybe the change is in the 4th position.

Alternatively, perhaps the first few nucleotides are where the change is. Let's look at the exact differences.

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…T
