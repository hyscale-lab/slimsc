Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light diffraction. Hmm, let's see. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field region where intensity maxima and minima occur. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ is approximately θ.

Wait, N is infinitely large, so the polygon becomes a circle? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So the aperture is effectively a circular one. But wait, the original question says it's a polygon with all apothems equal. An apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, all apothems are equal. So when N is large, it's a circle with radius equal to the apothem a. Or is it the radius? Wait, I think for a polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the aperture is a circle with radius a.

But wait, when light passes through a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk. The minima in the diffraction pattern occur at certain angles. The first minimum is at an angle θ where the argument of the Bessel function J1 is at
