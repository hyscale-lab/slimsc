Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved in complex ion equilibria. Let me try to think through this.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and thiocyanate is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the structure of these complexes? I think for Co(II), the common thiocyanate complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m. The stability constant βn is for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- maybe, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or wait, sometimes the charge might be different. I'm a bit confused about the charges, but maybe I don't need to know the exact charges because the question is about the percentage of a specific complex.

The question asks for the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, right? And the stability constant is β2=40.

But wait, I think the problem refers to the blue color as the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the blue one is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Hmm, not sure, but I'll proceed with the given data.

The problem is about finding the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex. So, the approach is to calculate the fraction of Co that exists as each possible complex (n=0,1,2,3,4) and then find the fraction for n=2.

We can model this using the stability constants. The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations. But with multiple complexes, it's a bit tricky because each complex formation depends on the previous ones.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be calculated based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The formula involves the logarithm of the product of β and the ligand concentration to some power, divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible complex.

Let me think of the formula. The fraction f_n for each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN-]^n) / sum over k of (β_k * [SCN-]^k )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each complex is formed stepwise: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, then [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So the formation of each complex depends on the previous ones.

Alternatively, the fraction can be calculated using the stepwise formation constants. Hmm, wait, the stability
