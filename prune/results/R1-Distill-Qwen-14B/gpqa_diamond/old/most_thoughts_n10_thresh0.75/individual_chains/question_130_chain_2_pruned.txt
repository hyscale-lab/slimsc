Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about astronomy, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of objects (like quasars) such that large clouds of neutral hydrogen can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The specific absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. So, let me think. Neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs at a wavelength of about 121.6 nanometers, right? Oh wait, that's 1216 Angstroms because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers. So 121.6 nm is 1216 Angstroms.

The question says that these clouds absorb the light from background quasars at this Lyman alpha wavelength. So the quasars emit light, and the hydrogen clouds in front of them (from our perspective) absorb this light at 1216 Angstroms. But wait, when a cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength of the absorption line changes. So the redshift z affects the observed wavelength.

Redshift z is given by the formula: observed wavelength (λ_observed) = λ_rest * (1 + z). So if the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, then λ_obs = 1216
