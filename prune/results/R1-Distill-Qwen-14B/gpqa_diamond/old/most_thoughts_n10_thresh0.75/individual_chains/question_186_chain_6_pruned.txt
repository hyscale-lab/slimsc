Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. 

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane... right, that's norbornane structure. So it's a norbornene derivative with a substituent.

The question is about the product after a Cope rearrangement. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a thermal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. But wait, this compound isn't a diene, it's an azabicyclo compound. Oh right, but the Cope rearrangement can also apply to other systems, maybe involving conjugated ene and amine groups or something like that.

Wait, the structure here is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the main ring is norbornene, with a 2-azabicyclo, meaning there's a nitrogen in the ring. The substituent is a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but I think it's CH₂=CH-) at position 2. 

Wait, the structure: the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene part means there are two rings, a bridge structure
