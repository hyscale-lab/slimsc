Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. The name suggests there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part. So, I think the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (from the aldehyde) and another substituent which is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

So, ethynylcyclohexane is the starting material. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, the compound is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group.

I need to find the sequence of reagents that will transform this into the target. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me look at each step in the possible reactions.

Let's think about what's needed. The target has an aldehyde group. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond, so maybe that can be converted into a carbonyl. Also, there's a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group which is connected to the cyclohexane. So perhaps I need to form that substituent.

Let me consider possible reaction steps. The triple bond can be manipulated via various methods. One common way to convert a triple bond to a carbonyl is through oxidation. For example, using O3 (ozone) followed by work-up, but that usually gives ketones or aldehydes depending on the structure. Alternatively, using a mercury-based oxidizing agent, like HgSO4 in H2SO4, which is the oxymercuration method. Wait, but that typically is for alkyl halides, maybe?

Alternatively, maybe we can do a hydration of the triple bond. Like, adding water across the triple bond to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH. No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent of C≡CH.

So, to get the aldehyde group, perhaps we can add a hydroxyl group and then oxidize it? Or maybe add something else. Alternatively, maybe we can perform a hydrohalogenation, then a substitution.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the triple bond can be converted into an aldehyde via a two-step process. First, perhaps deprotonate to form a lithium acetylide, then add a methyl group or something to form a longer chain. Hmm, not sure.

Looking at the options, the first reagent in each is either NaNH2, methyl chloride, or methanol. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent, perhaps in an alkylation reaction. If it's NaNH2 and methyl chloride, that might be an alkylation of an acetylide.

So, let's think about the first step. If we have ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH), and we treat it with NaNH2 (a strong base), perhaps deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide. Then methyl chloride would methylate it. So, the acetylide (C6H11-C≡C-) would react with CH3Cl to form C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that would be a longer chain. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so the proton is acidic (pKa around 25), so NaNH2 would deprotonate it to form the cyclohexylacetylide.

Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it, so the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexyl-1-propyne (C6H11-C≡C-CH3). But wait, then we have a longer alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming the acetylide, then perhaps adding a group adjacent to the triple bond.

Wait, but the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group. Wait, perhaps the idea is to form a cyclopropyl ring or perform a ring expansion?

Alternatively, maybe the first step is for deprotonation and alkylation, adding a methyl group. Then, the next step is hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. Wait, but hydrogenation of a triple bond typically leads to a single bond with perhaps a double bond in between, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group. So, perhaps a neighboring group participation or some kind of ring-forming reaction.

Wait, let me think about the target structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring (let's say ring A) has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a CH2 group, which is connected to an -OH and a cyclohexyl group (ring B). So, the substituent is -CH2-OH-(cyclohexyl). And the same ring A also has a carbonyl group (from aldehyde).

So, ring A has two substituents: the -CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group and the -CHO group at the same carbon (position 1), I suppose.

Wait, no. Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent is at position 1: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the structure is cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (CHO) and another substituent at the same carbon (position 1), which is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl (OH) and another cyclohexyl group.

So, how to get there from ethynylcyclohexane.

Let me think about each step as per the options. Let's look at Option C: steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride would deprotonate the ethynyl group to form the acetylide, then methyl chloride would methylate it, giving a longer alkyne.

Step 2: H2 with Pd as catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond. So, the alkyne becomes a single bond, but what's the product? So, if we have CH2CH2 after hydrogenation? Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne (like HC≡C-R) would add two H's and become CH2-CH2-R. Wait, but that would require a catalyst. But wait, sometimes hydrogenation of terminal alkynes can be tricky, but with a catalyst like Lindlar's, it gives cis addition, but with H2 and Pd, maybe it's full hydrogenation to single bond?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option.

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride. Then H2/Pd. Then Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxidation? Not sure. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are in the presence of H2O, that's the typical oxymercuration conditions, but I'm not sure.

Option B: Steps: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in liquid NH3; then O3, H2O; then NH4OH.

Hmm, ethyl chloride would provide an ethyl group. Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Wait, O3 is ozone, which is used for ozonolysis. When you ozonolyse an alkene, it breaks the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. But in this case, after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, which is a single bond. Wait, but if step 2 is H2/Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so if the starting material was ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH), after hydrogenation, it becomes C6H11-CH2-CH2-? No, wait. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. So, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So, the structure would become C6H11-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and a catalyst (like Pd) would give an alkane. So, it would become C6H11-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's not correct because ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-Cyclohexane, so the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, after hydrogenation, it would be cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH3 group. So, that would be ethylcyclohexane.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to get us closer to the target. The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group that's attached to the cyclohexane.

Hmm, maybe I should think about each option's reagents and what they do.

Let me think about the target molecule. The aldehyde group might come from oxidizing a primary alcohol. So perhaps there's a step where an -OH group is oxidized to an aldehyde. Alternatively, the triple bond could be oxidized directly to the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl. Let's think about the possible reagents.

Ozonolysis (O3) of an alkyne would give different products. Ozonolysis of alkynes typically results in breaking the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if we have R-C≡C-R', ozonolysis would give R-O and R'-O, but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, ozonolysis of terminal alkynes can give diketones or other products, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, using a mercury-based oxidizing agent like HgSO4 in H2SO4. Oxymercuration is used for alkyl halides, but wait, if we have a triple bond, perhaps it can be hydrated to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility: The triple bond is converted into a carbonyl via hydration. For that, we can use HgSO4 and H2SO4 (H+ and Hg2+), which would hydrate the triple bond to form a carbonyl.

So, for example, ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH) when treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would form C6H11-CO-H. Wait, no, that's not right. The hydration of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) would give R-C(OH)CH3? Wait, no, wait. The hydration of a terminal alkyne typically produces an enol, which tautomerizes to a ketone. Wait, no, that might not be right.

Wait, no. Hydration of a terminal alkyne (HC≡C-R) can form either a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on conditions. For example, acidic conditions with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would lead to the formation of a ketone. Alternatively, using a different catalyst might give an aldehyde.

Wait, but in this case, the target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps we need to form an aldehyde from the triple bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde via a two-step process: first, deprotonate to form the acetylide, then add a methyl group, then hydrogenate, then oxidize.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the options again.

Option C: The steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride (so deprotonate to acetylide, then methylate to form a longer alkyne?), 2. H2/Pd (hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane?), then O3 with (CH3)2S (probably a reductive work-up in ozone cleavage), and then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let me imagine each step:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Ethynylcyclohexane has the structure C6H11-C≡CH. When treated with NaNH2, a strong base, it deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide ion: C6H11-C≡C^- + NH3^-.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate the acetylide. So the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, giving C6H11-C≡C-CH3. So now, the compound is 1-propynylcyclohexane? Or perhaps 1-propargylcyclohexane.

Wait, no, the initial structure is ethynylcyclohexane, so it's CH2-Cyclohexane with the triple bond. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, when you deprotonate that, you get the cyclohexylacetylide.

Adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexyl-1-propyne: C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So, the product would be C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's an alkane, which doesn't have any functional groups—so that might not be helpful.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is usually for cleaving double bonds. But if the molecule after step 2 has a single bond, perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe step 2 doesn't hydrogenate completely, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation to a cis or trans alkene, but I thought that H2/Pd would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Hmm.

If after step 2, the molecule is an alkane, then ozonolysis wouldn't do much. Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me think about another option. Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li in liquid NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol: Methanol is a methylating agent. So, deprotonate to form acetylide, then methylate to form C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

Then, Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. So, if you have a structure like C6H11-C≡C-CH3, treating with Li in NH3 might induce elimination, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's for forming a more substituted alkyne via deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's about forming a Grignard reagent or something else. Alternatively, Li in liquid NH3 could be for deprotonating something to form a strong base.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction after alkyne alkylation is to form a diene or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an alkene. For example, using a reducing agent like Li and NH3 can lead to the formation of an alkene via a deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is being hydrogenated to a double bond. But I thought H2 with Pd would do full hydrogenation.

Alternatively, maybe the first step isn't alkylation. Maybe NaNH2 and methyl chloride is for a different purpose.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is then attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps we need to form a new ring or a bridge.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is attached via a CH2-OH group. So, maybe the synthesis involves forming a hemiacetal or some kind of ring-opening.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is first modified to form a ketone or aldehyde, then further reactions add substituents.

Hmm, maybe I should think about each reagent's role in each option.

Looking at option C again:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: forms the acetylide and methylates, giving C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane, so it becomes C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis is typically for double bonds, but in this case, the molecule is all single bonds. Unless I'm missing something, perhaps the hydrogenation step didn't go all the way, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation doesn't occur.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation step is actually a hydrogenolysis or something else. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, the alkyne becomes an alkane.

Then, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything as there's no double bonds. So that step wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the step 3 is not ozonolysis but something else. Hmm.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in NH3; then O3, H2O; then NH4OH.

So first, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group: C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, Li in NH3: perhaps elimination to form a longer alkyne? Or maybe it's a Birch reduction? Not sure. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is a strong base for elimination, perhaps forming a more substituted alkyne or alkene.

After that, O3 and H2O: ozonolysis. But if the molecule is an alkyne, ozonolysis may not do much. Unless it's converted into a double bond.

Wait, maybe the Li/NH3 step is for deprotonating and eliminating to form a double bond.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me take a different approach.

The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group, which is attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group next to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenating the triple bond to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis of the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Oxidation or other steps to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Wait, another possibility: The triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. For that, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (option A, step 3), which is a method for oxidizing terminal alkynes to carboxylic acids. Wait, but in that case, the triple bond would become a COOH group. But the target has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if we have a triple bond, maybe we can oxidize it to a ketone or aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into an aldehyde, then further reactions form the hydroxyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the triple bond to form an acetylide.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

3. Hydrogenation to form a single bond.

4. Ozonolysis to break the bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in that case, after step 3, the molecule would have a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis breaks the double bond into carbonyls.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, let's think:

Step 1: Deprotonate and alkylation to form a longer alkyne. For example, ethynylcyclohexane becomes a propargyl group.

Step 2: Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene. So, H2 and a catalyst would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, making a double bond.

Then, step 3: Ozonolysis of the alkene to form two carbonyl groups.

But wait, the ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for a propargyl group, after hydrogenation to propene, ozonolysis would give formaldehyde and another carbonyl.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group. So, perhaps the alkyne is extended, then hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the target structure. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1: a CH2 group connected to OH and another cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bridged structure. For example, using a cyclopropane or some ring expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to add a new substituent. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide, then alkylation to add a group, then hydrogenation to form a new substituent, then oxidation.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: makes the acetylide and adds a methyl group, so structure becomes C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate the triple bond to CH2-CH2 (so it's now C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3).

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis on the single bond? Doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the steps don't make sense in option C.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li in NH3; O3, H2O; NH4OH.

So, step 1: acetylide + ethyl chloride gives C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3: Maybe elimination to form a more substituted alkyne? Or perhaps deprotonation to form a strong base. Alternatively, it could be a dehydrohalogenation if there was a leaving group, but in this case, we have an alkyne.

Wait, maybe the Li in NH3 is used to reduce the alkyne. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings, which we don't have here.

Step 3: O3 and H2O. Ozonolysis would cleave double bonds, but if step 2 didn't form a double bond, then this step wouldn't do much. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 forms a double bond via elimination.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a reduction. No, Li in NH3 is a strong base, not a reducing agent. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the first step adds an ethyl group, then step 2 forms a double bond via elimination, then step 3 ozonolysis breaks it into carbonyls.

Let me imagine that:

After step 1: C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 could deprotonate and eliminate, converting the alkyne into an alkene. For example, if the alkyne is C≡C-CH2CH3, elimination could form a double bond, perhaps between the two central carbons, making CH2=CHCH2CH3. But I'm not sure if that's what happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if the alkene were, say, CH2=CHCH2CH3, ozonolysis would give formaldehyde and another carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure if this leads to the target structure.

Option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li in NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide, then methylate with methanol. Wait, wait—methanol is a nucleophile. So, the acetylide would attack the methyl group from methanol? Or perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 in methanol would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then methyl chloride would methylate it. But in option D, the second reagent is methanol. Wait, so step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, the acetylide would take a methyl group from methanol? But methanol is a poor methylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Then step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe elimination or another reaction.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to rethink the entire approach.

Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group and an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxymethyl group and then forming the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the steps involve adding a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond, then hydrogenating the triple bond to form a CH2 group, and then introducing a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group first, then functionalized.

Wait, let me think. To form an aldehyde, perhaps we can oxidize a primary alcohol. So, perhaps the steps involve forming a primary alcohol, then oxidizing it.

So, perhaps the plan is:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize that primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But how?

Alternatively, let's think about the possible reagents.

If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH), perhaps step 1 is deprotonation to form the acetylide, then alkylation to add a methyl group, making C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane: C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that doesn't lead us towards an aldehyde.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, we hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene, then perform ozonolysis to cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think: If after step 1, we have C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond. Using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis addition, but perhaps using a different catalyst would give trans. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Then, step 3: Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the molecule becomes C6H11-CO and O=CH3. But that seems unlikely, as I'm not sure about the exact products.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups.

Wait, but the target has a single aldehyde group. So this might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for the correct option based on each step's likely reagents.

Another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. So, perhaps we need to form a new ring or a branch. One possible way is using a Grignard reagent or a similar addition.

Wait, but the options don't include Grignard reagents. So, maybe the alkylation is part of that.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, which then undergoes oxidation to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then a neighboring group is added.

Wait, another approach: Think about each option's reagents and see which leads to the target.

Option C: Steps after alkylation and hydrogenation would produce an alkane, but then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that can't be right.

Option D: Steps include O3 and then NH4OH. So, perhaps it's a way to form carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, let's imagine:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane becomes C6H11-C≡C-CH3 (after alkylation).

Step 2: Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, making C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning C≡C into CH2-CH2. So, from C6H11-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that's an alkane with no functional groups. Then, step 3: ozonolysis doesn't do anything. So that's not helpful.

Hmm... Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target molecule's structure again.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1: a CH2 group linked to an OH and a cyclohexyl group. And the same carbon also has a carbonyl group (CHO). So, it's a geminal di-substitution: both substituents on the same carbon.

Wait, but that's not possible because a carbon can't have five bonds. Oh wait, no. Wait, the substituents are on the same carbon of the cyclohexane ring, which is a secondary carbon. So, the substituent is a group that has a CH2 connected to OH and another cyclohexyl group.

So, the substituent is a CH2-OH-(cyclohexyl) group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl and also a CHO group on the same carbon.

Wait, that's confusing. Oh wait, no. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is attached to the cyclohexane. Then, at position 1, there's a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexane has two substituents: the aldehyde (CHO) and the (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group on adjacent carbons.

No, wait, the numbering is such that the substituents are on the same carbon. So, the same carbon has both the aldehyde and the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, but that's not possible because a carbon can only have four bonds. So, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to OH and cyclohexyl, and the same carbon has the aldehyde group. So, the structure would be:

Ring carbon - C(=O)H and -CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl.

Wait, that's possible. So, the same carbon has both substituents. So, that carbon is connected to:

- Two cyclohexane rings (the main ring and the substituent ring),

- A carbonyl group (CHO),

- And a hydroxyl-methyl group.

Wait, but that would make five bonds. That can't be right. So I must have misunderstood the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is:

Ring carbon - CHO and -CH2-OH-(cyclohexyl).

Ah, that makes sense. The substituent is a CH2 group attached to OH and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon has the aldehyde group.

So, the substituent is a CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl group attached to the ring, and the same carbon has a CHO group.

So, the ring has two substituents at the same carbon: CHO and CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl.

Wait, no, the substituent is only one: the (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group, and that's at position 1. The aldehyde is part of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so it's at position 1 as well. So, perhaps the same carbon has both groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try to draw it mentally.

The main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group. The substituent at position 1 is a CH2 group, which is attached to an OH group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH)-cyclohexyl.

Wait, but that would make the substituent -(CH2-OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the same carbon as the aldehyde has a CH2 group attached to OH and cyclohexyl.

So, the structure is:

Cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1: a CH2 group that is connected to OH and another cyclohexyl group, and the same position also has an aldehyde group.

But that would require the carbon to have four bonds: two to the cyclohexane ring (as it's a substituent on a ring carbon), a CH2 group, and an aldehyde. That's four bonds, which is possible.

Wait, no. The substituent is a single group attached to the ring. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group which is attached to both OH and cyclohexyl. So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH)cyclohexyl, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -(CH2-OH)(cyclohexyl) group, which is a bit ambiguous in terms of structure.

At this point, perhaps the best approach is to think about the reagents and see which sequence logically forms the target structure.

The target has an aldehyde group, which likely comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is oxidizing an -OH group to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, the steps that involve oxidation include:

- Option A: Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4/HgSO4.

- Option C: O3 and (CH3)2S followed by Ba(OH)2.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Option D: O3 and (CH3)2S followed by NH4OH. NH4OH is a mild reducing agent, maybe for reductive work-up in ozonolysis.

Wait, but ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if a double bond is present, ozonolysis can break it into two carbonyls.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is converted into a longer alkyne via alkylation.

2. Hydrogenated to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's consider option C again. Steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: forms C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates to C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: perhaps no reaction since no double bonds.

So, that can't be correct.

Option B:

1. Ethyl chloride alkylation gives C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3: maybe forms a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis: breaks double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH: work-up.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 step is for elimination, converting the alkyne into an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

If the alkene is in the middle, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. So, maybe the target has an aldehyde.

But the target has only one aldehyde group. So, perhaps the other carbonyl is a ketone or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 step is for forming a more substituted alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Option D:

Steps: NaNH2 and methanol; then Li in NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Methanol as a methylating agent may not work well, but perhaps it's for some other purpose. Then, Li in NH3 could be for elimination or deprotonation.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps it's time to think about the most logical steps to form the target.

Given that the target has an aldehyde, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, which is then oxidized or functionalized.

The usual method to convert a terminal alkyne to an aldehyde is via hydration using HgSO4 and H2SO4, but I think that typically gives a ketone, unless the alkyne is internal. Wait, no, terminal alkynes upon hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 give ketones if it's RC≡CR', but if it's HC≡C-R, it gives R-C(OH)CH3, which is a ketone.

Wait, but in the target, we need an aldehyde, so perhaps the starting alkyne is internal. But our starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via a different method. Another approach is via the hydroboration-oxidation of alkynes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the oxidation step. The target has an aldehyde, so perhaps there's an oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing an -OH group, then oxidizing it.

But how to get the -OH group in the correct position.

Another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. So, perhaps a cyclohexyl group is added via a Grignard reagent or another alkylation method.

Wait, but the options don't include Grignard reagents. So, perhaps the alkylation step is done via an acetylide.

So, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

4. Introduce an -OH group via some method.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then a neighboring group is added.

Wait, maybe after converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group, we can perform a nucleophilic addition to attach the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the target has the cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. So, perhaps the OH is introduced via a hydroxylation step, like oxymercuration or some other method.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, in option C, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as a work-up. So, that would give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or forming epoxides.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, we get a carbonyl group, then Ba(OH)2 could cause some kind of aldol condensation or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Base treatment to form the final structure.

But I'm not certain.

After struggling through this, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, but earlier analysis didn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Another approach: The target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol or a geminal diol.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl, then subjected to some addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a ring. For example, through a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard addition is done, but again, Grignard isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne into a ketone.

2. Perform a nucleophilic attack to add a cyclohexyl group.

3. Oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

In conclusion, after considering all the options, the correct sequence of reagents is option C.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent at position 1: a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride likely form an acetylide and methylate it.
   - Step 2: H2/Pd hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but its role here is unclear.
   - Step 4: H2SO4 and HgSO4 suggest oxidation, but this sequence does not align with forming the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride form an acetylide and ethylate it.
   - Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 could induce elimination or deprotonation, potentially forming a double bond.
   - Step 3: O3/H2O suggests ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH4OH is a mild reducing agent, but this sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride form an acetylide and methylate it, resulting in a longer alkyne.
   - Step 2: H2/Pd hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane.
   - Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S suggests ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond after hydrogenation, making this step ineffective.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but its role here is unclear. This sequence does not align with forming the target structure.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol form an acetylide, but methanol is a poor methylating agent.
   - Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 could induce elimination or deprotonation.
   - Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S suggests ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond, making this step ineffective.
   - Step 4: NH4OH is a mild reducing agent, but this sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly align with the steps required to synthesize the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite gaps in the logical sequence.
