Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves the scattering of particles where they don't lose any kinetic energy, so it's like a perfectly elastic collision. But wait, the question is about phase shifts and the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Oh right, I think that's related to the partial wave expansion in scattering theory.

The problem gives me some phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the energy of the electrons is 50 MeV. They want the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. The options are A to D, all in fm, which is femtometers, 1e-15 meters.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude... Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics and phase shifts. The general form is something like f(θ, φ) = (1/(2i)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} }. But wait, perhaps I should think about the expression for the imaginary part. Or maybe there's a simpler formula for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is when θ=0 degrees.

Wait, when the scattering is along the direction of the incident beam, θ=0. The scattering amplitude along that direction is known as the forward scattering amplitude. So, I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0, φ), but since when θ=0, the azimuthal angle φ doesn't matter because it's symmetric around the beam axis. So perhaps the dependence on φ disappears here.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is f(s, θ, φ) = (1/(2i)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} ). 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about how to compute the imaginary part. Alternatively, I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude relates to the optical theorem, which connects the total cross-section
