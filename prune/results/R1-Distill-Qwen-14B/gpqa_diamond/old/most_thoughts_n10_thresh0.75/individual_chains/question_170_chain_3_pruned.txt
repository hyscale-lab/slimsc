Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I need to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, that notation probably means a two-component spinor. So the state vector is (3i, 4)^T. Oh, right, because electrons have spin-1/2, so the state is a two-component vector.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation. So for S_y, the expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ>. But wait, what's S_y in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh, right, the spin operators are given by S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix.

The Pauli Y matrix σ_y is given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

So the expectation value would be ψ† S_y ψ.

Let me write out ψ as a column vector:
ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, the state is given as (3i, 4). So in vector form, it's [3i, 4]^T. But when calculating the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ, which is the same as (S_y)_{ij} ψ_i^* ψ_j.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute by first finding ψ†, then S_y, then ψ.

Let me write down each step.

First, ψ is [3i, 4], so ψ† is [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Let me correct. The conjugate transpose of ψ would be [ -3i, 4 ] because (3i)* is -3i (since i* is -i). Wait, no, wait. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, no: 3i is 3 multiplied by i. Its conjugate is 3*(-i), which is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no
