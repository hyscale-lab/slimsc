Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature has to do with the balance between the incoming radiation and the outgoing infrared radiation. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but wait, that's probably more detailed than I need right now.

Wait, the question says all planets have the same albedo. Oh right, because albedo affects how much of the light is reflected. So same albedo means that the factor for reflection is the same for all, so it might not come into play in the ratio. Or does it? Let me think. The equilibrium temperature formula is often given as T = T_eff * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( L / (4πσd²) )^(1/4). Wait, maybe I should simplify it. Since all planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is the same for all. So when taking the ratio between two planets, that term cancels out.

So the ratio of their temperatures depends on the ratio of the square roots of their distances from the star. Because the formula involves (L/(4πσd²))^(1/4), which is the same as (1/d²)^(1/4) if L and σ are the same for all (since they're around the same star). So that's (d^(-2))^(1/4) = d^(-0.5). So the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So if the periods are in that ratio, how does that relate to their distances?

I remember that for planets in circular orbits, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed (Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³). So P² = k * a³, where k depends on the star's mass and other factors. So a³ is proportional to P², which means a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So if Planet_2 has a period P2, and Planet_4 has P4, then a4 is proportional to (P4/P2)^(2/3) times a2. So the distance ratio a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, the periods are given in ratios. Let me list them:

Planet 1: 1
Planet 2: 2
Planet 3: 2.5
Planet 4: 3.5
Planet 5: 5

So P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4, so (7/4)^(2/3) = ( (7/4)^(1/3) )².

Alternatively, I can compute 1.75^(2/3) numerically.

What's 1.75^(1/3)? Let's approximate. The cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So 1.2^3 ≈ 1.728, which is just a bit less than 1.75. So 1.2 maybe a little higher. Let me think, 1.2^3 = 1.728. 1.21^3 is about 1.21*1.21=1.4641, then *1.21 is around 1.771561. Oh wait, that's over 1.75. So 1.21^3 is ~1.7716. So 1.75 is between 1.2 and 1.21.

So maybe 1.205^3? Let me see: 1.2^3=1.728, 1.205^3 = (1.2+0.005)^3. Let's compute:

(1.2 + 0.005)^3 ≈ 1.2^3 + 3*(1.2)^2*0.005 + 3*1.2*(0.005)^2 + (0.005)^3.

1.2^3=1.728, 3*(1.44)*(0.005)=3*0.0072=0.0216. 3*1.2*(0.000025)=0.00009. And the last term is negligible. So total is ~1.728 + 0.0216 + 0.00009 = 1.74969. Close to 1.75. So 1.205^3 ≈ 1.7497, which is almost 1.75. So (1.75)^(1/3) ≈ 1.205.

So (1.75)^(2/3) = (1.205)^2 ≈ 1.452.

Wait, 1.205 squared is (1.2 +0.005)^2 = 1.44 + 0.012 +0.000025 ≈ 1.452.

So a4 is about 1.452 times a2. So a4/a2 ≈1.452.

But since the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (because T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2)), the temperature ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = 1 / sqrt( a4 / a2 ) = 1/ sqrt(1.452).

Compute sqrt(1.452): sqrt(1.44)=1.2, sqrt(1.45)= approximately 1.204. Let me compute 1.204^2: 1.204 *1.204. 1.2*1.2=1.44, 0.004*1.2=0.0048, so (1.2 + 0.004)^2 = 1.44 + 2*(1.2)(0.004) + (0.004)^2 → 1.44 +0.0096 +0.000016=1.449616. Hmm, but 1.452 is a bit higher than 1.449616. So 1.204^2=1.4496, which is just under 1.452. So let me try 1.205^2: 1.205 *1.205 = (1.2 + 0.005)^2=1.44 + 0.012 +0.000025 = 1.452025. Oh, that's exactly 1.452025, which is very close to 1.452. So sqrt(1.452) ≈1.205.

So sqrt(1.452) is about 1.205. Thus, the ratio T4/T2 = 1/1.205 ≈ 0.8298.

Wait, but wait, the options are A) ~0.57, B) ~0.69, C) ~0.83, D) ~0.75.

So 0.83 is option C. So the answer would be C.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the planets. The planets are Planet_1 through Planet_5, and their periods are in the order 1, 2, 2.5,3.5,5.

So Planet_2 has period 2, Planet_4 has period 3.5. So the ratio of their periods P4/P2 is 3.5/2=1.75.

So yes, that's correct. So the distance ratio a4/a2 is (1.75)^(2/3) ≈1.452. So the temperatures would be T4 = T2 * (a2 / a4)^(1/2) → T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(1.452)≈0.829.

Which rounds to approximately 0.83, so option C is correct.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the fact that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star, i.e., \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto a^3 \)), the semi-major axis (distance) ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

Approximating \( (1.75)^{1/3} \), we find it is close to \( 1.205 \). Squaring this gives \( (1.75)^{2/3} \approx 1.452 \). Thus, the distance ratio is \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.452 \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1.452}}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{1.452} \), we find it is close to \( 1.205 \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.205} \approx 0.829.
\]

This value rounds to approximately \( 0.83 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
