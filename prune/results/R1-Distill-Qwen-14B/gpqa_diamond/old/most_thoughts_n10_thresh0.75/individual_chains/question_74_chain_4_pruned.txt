Okay, so I have this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think through it. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Wait, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance the atom has decayed. But wait, probability in radioactive decay usually refers to the chance that the atom decays within a certain time period. So I think this relates to the concept of half-life or the decay constant.

I remember that the decay follows an exponential law. The formula I think is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, and λ is the decay constant. But wait, the problem gives a probability of decay within 100 minutes as 32%, which is 0.32. So the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt), right? Because N(t) is the remaining, so the decayed fraction is 1 - N(t)/N0.

So given that at t=100 minutes, the probability is 32%, that means 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Taking the natural log on both sides, -λ*10
