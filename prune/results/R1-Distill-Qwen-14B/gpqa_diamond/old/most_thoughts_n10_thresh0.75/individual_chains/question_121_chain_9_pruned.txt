Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident about epoxide reactions yet. But I'll try to think it through.

The question is about reacting a specific epoxide with Me2CuLi, which is a organocuprate reagent. The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack epoxides in an SN2 mechanism. 

Wait, the problem says that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. Also, for disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the starting epoxide. The bicyclo [4.1.0]heptane part means it's a norbornane-like structure. The substituents are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Let me draw it mentally: norbornane has two bridgeheads. The numbering goes such that positions 1 and 4 are bridgeheads. So, 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.

Wait, the epoxide is at position 7-oxa, so the oxygen is in the seven position. So, in norbornane, the bridge between carbons 6 and 1 would have an oxygen, making it an epoxide ring. So the epoxide is between carbons 6 and 1? Or 1 and 6? Because in bicyclo [4.1.0], the bridge is between positions 1 and 6, I think. So the epoxide is between C1 and C6.

Wait, the structure is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So the oxygen is at position 7, which is one of the bridge positions. So the epoxide is between C1 and C6, perhaps.

So the starting molecule is a norbornene-derived epoxide, with methyl groups at 1,3,4, and 6 positions. Wait, noâ€” the substituents are 1,3,4,6. So, 1,3,4,6 all have methyl groups. Wait, the formula given is 1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So the substituents are methyl at 1,3,4, and the oxygen is at 7 (so the epoxide is between 1 and 6? Or 6 and another position? Hmm, maybe I should look up the structure of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the epoxide as a three-membered ring. When the organocuprate attacks, it will open the epoxide by adding the methyl group (from Me2CuLi) to the less hindered carbon.

Wait, in the epoxide, each oxygen is connected to two carbons. Let's say the epoxide is
