Alright, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, okay, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, that's the initial probability. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. Oh right, radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which means the decay is memoryless. That's the key here. So, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the future probability—it's like a fresh start. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Oh, right, the decay probability given is for a certain time interval. The 32% is the probability over 100 minutes. But maybe I should find the decay constant first. Because decay probabilities over different time intervals depend on that.

So, the formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. The probability of decay is 1 - N(t)/N0, right? So, the probability P is 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that P is 32% for t=100 minutes. Let me write that equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So, λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, but ln(0.68) is a negative number, so when I multiply by -1, it becomes positive. Let me compute that. Let's see, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but 0.68 is a bit higher than 2/3. Let me actually compute it. Using a calculator in my mind, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.

So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is about the probability after an additional 150 minutes. But wait, the 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So, the total time from the initial setup is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or is it that the 150 minutes is just the next period? Hmm, wait no. Wait, the initial 100 minutes was the time for the 32% probability. Now, after 50 minutes have passed without decay, we're looking at the next 150 minutes.

Wait, no, the decay is a memoryless process. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes regardless of the past. So, the remaining time is 150 minutes, and we compute the probability for that time period.

Alternatively, maybe we should compute the probability over the next
