Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

So the question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. The problem gives some elemental abundance ratios determined using the EW method, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

The given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need to find (nSi/Star1) / (nSi/Star2) → nSi1 / nSi2.

Wait, no, actually, the ratio would be nSi1 / nSi2? Or is it the other way around? The question says the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2, so Star_1 over Star_2. So nSi,1 / nSi,2.

I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(nX/nY) relative to the Sun. Oh wait, no, wait. The [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY) minus log10(nX/nY)_sun. So for example, [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. If [Fe/H] is 0, that means Fe abundance is the same as the Sun.

So for Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 is 0 → log10(nFe1/nH1) = [Fe/H]_1 + log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → which is 0 + (-4.5) = -4.5. So nFe1/nH1 = 10^(-4.5)

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log10(nSi1/nFe1) = [Si/Fe]_1 + log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The definition is [X/Y] = log10(nX / nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)
