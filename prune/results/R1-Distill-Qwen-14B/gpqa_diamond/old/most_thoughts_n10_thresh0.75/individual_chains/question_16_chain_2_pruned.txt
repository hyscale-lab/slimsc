Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a compound has chiral centers or some other form of asymmetry, like if there's a plane of symmetry or not. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)Cl? Or wait, butene is four carbons. Let me think. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, wait. No, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no, butane is four carbons. So 1 is the first carbon, butene is double bond between 1-2. So the structure is ClCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- something? Wait, no. Wait, the formula would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But with a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl on C1, double bond C1-C2, and a methyl on C2. So it's Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 which has a methyl group. So, would this molecule have a double bond with substituents on each end? Wait, but on C1, Cl and a double bond, and on C2, a methyl group and another CH2? Hmm. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 and
