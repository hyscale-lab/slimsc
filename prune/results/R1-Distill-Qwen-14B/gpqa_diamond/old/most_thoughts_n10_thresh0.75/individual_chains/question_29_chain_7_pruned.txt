Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found mutations in the first exon. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so the gene's normal sequence is given, and each mutant has a different change in the first exon. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so changes here can affect the protein product. Since the compound is anti-nutritional, the gene probably codes for a protein that produces it. So, if the gene is mutated, maybe the protein won't be made, thus eliminating the compound.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, compare the first part: the intact has ...TTTCTCGCTGG..., while mutant 1 is ...TTCTACGCTGG...

Wait, so the first change is at the 4th position maybe. Let me count the letters. Let me see:

Intact: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C... Hmm, maybe a substitution. Like a change from CTC to CTA? Or wait, looking at the exact differences.

Wait, the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, looking at the first part. So the intact is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT, mutant 1 is TTCTACGCTGGTACT. So the intact has positions 4-6 as TCT, and mutant has TCT as well? Wait, maybe I should count the letters line by line.

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are. The first part of the intact gene is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

In Mutant 1, the same area is ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC T... Hmm, so maybe a substitution in the third codon? Or perhaps a frameshift? No, because the length is the same. It's a point mutation.

Wait, looking at the exact sequence:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant
