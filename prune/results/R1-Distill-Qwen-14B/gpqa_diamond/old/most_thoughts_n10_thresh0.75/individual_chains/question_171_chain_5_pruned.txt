Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions, specifically with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—either ortho, meta, or para. But wait, the question is asking about the weight fraction of the para-isomer in each case. So I need to figure out which substituents favor para substitution and how that affects the yield.

The substances given are 1 to 6. Let me list them out again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (Bromobenzene, but wait, no—Cl is the substituent here)
4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)

Wait, no, wait. For each compound, the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So each substituent will have a directing effect.

I think the para-directing groups are the meta directors and para directors. Let me recall:

- Strongly activating groups (like -O- (like in phenol), -NH2, -OH) are ortho/para directors. But wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think. Some groups activate the ring (electron-donating) and some deactivate (electron-withdrawing).

So, activating groups are typically ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups are either meta or, if they can donate through resonance, maybe ortho/para but deactivating.

Wait, nitro groups (-NO2) are strong deactivating and meta directing. So in nitrobenzene (substance 4), the incoming electrophile would add in the meta position. That would mean the para isomer isn't the main product, but perhaps a minor one?

Wait, but wait. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So if a substituent is meta directing, then the major product would be the meta isomer, but some para might still form. Similarly, if it's para directing, then more para is formed.

Wait, but which
