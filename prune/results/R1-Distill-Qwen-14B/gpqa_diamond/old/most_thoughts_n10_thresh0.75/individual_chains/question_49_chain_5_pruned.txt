Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question has three parts, each involving a different reaction, and I need to figure out the products based on the options provided.

Let's start by understanding what each reaction is about.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form product A. Hmm, I think this might be a Claisen rearrangement. Wait, but the Claisen is usually between an allyl vinyl ether and a carbonyl, right? Wait, but in some cases, amines can be involved. Oh, wait, the starting material has a methoxy group and an amine. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Cope rearrangement. The Cope is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. But I don't see a diene here. Let me think again. The first molecule is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Its structure is CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2. Wait, but that's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So the structure is (CH3O)2CHNH2. When it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOH with a double bond between C2 and C3? So structure is CH2CH2(OH)CH2? No, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on C2 and the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, so it's CH2-CH(OH)-
