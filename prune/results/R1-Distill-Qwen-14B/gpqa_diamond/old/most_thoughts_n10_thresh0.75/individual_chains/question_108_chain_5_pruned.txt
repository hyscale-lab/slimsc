Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so I guess m is like 0, 1, or -1 or something. I remember that the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field, is given by the Zeeman effect.

Wait, right, the Zeeman effect has two parts: the linear term and the quadratic term. But since m is small, maybe we're only considering the linear term here. The energy for the linear Zeeman effect is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin quantum number. But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, orbital magnetic quantum number is l, but the magnetic quantum number is m. Wait, the paramagnetic term is usually due to the electron's spin, but sometimes orbital contributions are considered too. Hmm.

Wait, no, paramagnetic effects are due to the spin of electrons, whereas the orbital contribution is part of the diamagnetic effect. So maybe in this case, the paramagnetic coupling term refers to the spin
