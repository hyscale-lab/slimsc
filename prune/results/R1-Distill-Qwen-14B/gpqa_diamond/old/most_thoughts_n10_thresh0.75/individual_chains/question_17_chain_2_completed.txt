Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to tackle it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so it's a 1:1 ratio because calcium is divalent (charge +2) and EDTA is tetravalent (charge -4). So each Ca²+ binds with one EDTA^4- ion.

The problem says the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex. I'm trying to find [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait a second, I think I need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The K for this dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant, right?

Wait, the formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But when the complex dissociates, the reaction is CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. So the equilibrium expression for dissociation is K_dissociation = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-].

But K_dissociation is 1/Kf. So K_d = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think that's the concentration of the complex. Let's denote the concentration as C = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the complex will dissociate a little. Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (because before dissociation)
[EDTA^4-] = 0.

Change:
Let x be the amount that dissociates. So:
[CaEDTA^2-] decreases by x → 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] increases by x → x
[EDTA^4-] increases by x → x.

Assuming that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the dissociation constant K_d = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02.

We know K_d is 2e-11.

So, x² = K_d * 0.02 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, 2e-11 multiplied by 0.02 is 4e-13? Let me compute that. 2 * 1e-11 is 2e-11. Multiply by 0.02 (which is 2e-2), so 2e-11 * 2e-2 = 4e-13. Yes.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, the square root is sqrt(4)=2, and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. Wait, wait, but 2e-6.5 is 2 * (1e-6.5). Let me compute 1e-6.5: 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 is between 6 and 7. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * that is about 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. The Kf is 5e10, which is a large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, which is why I assumed x is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So this makes sense.

Another way to think: since Kf is so large (5e10), the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low. Which is what we got, 6.3e-7 is much lower than 0.02, so the approximation holds.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we consider the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant for the complex is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of calcium ions that dissociate at equilibrium. Using the ICE table:

- Initial concentrations:  
  \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] = 0.02 \, \text{M}, \, [ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = 0, \, [ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = 0\).  
- Change:  
  \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \rightarrow 0.02 - x, \, [ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] \rightarrow x, \, [ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] \rightarrow x\).  
- At equilibrium:  
  \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \, (\text{since } x \ll 0.02), \, [ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x, \, [ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\).

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}.
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_d = \frac{x \cdot x}{0.02} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \cdot 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
