Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what the starting material is. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, benzene rings are usually numbered in a way that substituents get the lowest numbers. So 1-bromo-2-d... Wait, maybe that's a typo. Oh wait, wait, I think I've heard of 1,2-dibromo compounds before, but here it's 1-bromo and 2-d, maybe deuterium? Or perhaps it's a typo for something else. Wait, no, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichloro something. Wait, no, wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene, which would have Br and two Cl on adjacent carbons? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, perhaps the question is about 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Hmm, but the deuterium probably doesn't play a role in this reaction. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomp
