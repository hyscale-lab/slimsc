Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, I think. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two states might overlap, and you couldn't tell them apart. 

So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let me compute that sum. 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = approximately 7.216e-7 eV. 

Now, looking at the options: 

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 7e-7, so no.
B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, same issue.
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7e-7, so this would work.
D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is less than 7e-7 eV. So no.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the numbers. 

Wait, no, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute the uncertainties. 

Wait, ħ is 1.05e-34 J·s.

ΔE for E1: ħ / τ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J. To eV: 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.56e-7 eV. So yes, that's correct.

ΔE for E2: ħ / (1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J. 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 = 6.56e-8 eV.

Wait, but when you have two energy levels, each with their own lifetimes, what's the total uncertainty? Hmm, perhaps I should consider the uncertainty in the energy difference. Because the energy difference's uncertainty would be the sum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2. Because, if E1 has an uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 has ΔE2, then the difference E2-E1 would have an uncertainty of sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), assuming the uncertainties are independent.

Wait, is that right? Alternatively, the uncertainty in ΔE = E2 - E1 would be the sum of the uncertainties, because ΔE is a combination of E2 and E1.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the energy difference having an uncertainty of ΔE_diff = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But sometimes, when the two states are being observed, perhaps the time uncertainty is the same for both. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. 

Alternatively, perhaps the relevant time is the difference in lifetimes. Or perhaps the time uncertainty in the energy difference would be the average of the two times? Hmm, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference's uncertainty is the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. 

Wait, wait. Let me think about the energy resolution. To resolve two peaks in a spectrum, the energy difference between them should be greater than the combined resolution. The resolution is typically determined by the uncertainty in the energy. So, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, no, I think when you're trying to distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference should be larger than the total uncertainty in the energy measurements of each. So, to clearly separate them, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state.

In this case, each state has an uncertainty. So, the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 ≈ 6.56e-7 eV, and E2 is ΔE2 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So the total uncertainty in the system would be the sum, perhaps. So, ΔE_total ≈ 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = 7.216e-7 eV.

So, to clearly resolve the two states, ΔE should be larger than this sum. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is much larger than 7e-7, so that would work. 

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7, so it wouldn't. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let's compute the exact numbers more precisely.

Calculate ΔE1: ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J. To eV: 1 J = 6.242e18 eV, so 1.0545718e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J = approx 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 * 6.242e18 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 6.58e-8 eV. The sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than 7.238e-7 eV. 

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-6 eV = 1e-9 eV → much smaller than 7.2e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV = 1e4 * 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 100 times bigger than 7.2e-7. So yes, 1e-4 eV is much larger than the required. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.2e-7, so no.

So the correct option is C.


To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the total uncertainty in energy. The uncertainty in energy for each state is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, \( \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar / 2 \), where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. 

For \( E_1 \), the lifetime is \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), so the energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \), the lifetime is \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), so the energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
