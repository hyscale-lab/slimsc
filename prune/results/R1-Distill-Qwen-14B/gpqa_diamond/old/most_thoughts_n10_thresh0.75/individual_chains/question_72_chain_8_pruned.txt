Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions leading to a final product, and I need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in that product. The options are A to D, with numbers 4 to 10. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down.

First, let's read the problem carefully. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That sounds like a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, so this is a diene version, right? And at the 7 position, there's a tert-butoxy group. So structure-wise, I imagine the norbornene with a big substituent on one bridgehead.

Next, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, and the elevated temp probably means some kind of elimination or substitution reaction.

Wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group. That structure has two substituents on adjacent carbons, each with two bromine atoms. So each substituent is CH2Br2. Hmm, maybe this is a dienophile? Or perhaps it's undergoing some kind of coupling.

Wait, but norbornene is a diene. Maybe a Diels-Alder reaction is happening here. But for Diels-Alder, you need a diene and a dienophile. So the norbornene would be the diene, and the other molecule would be the dienophile. But wait, the other molecule, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, that's a conjugated diene itself. So maybe it's not acting as a dienophile but is undergoing some substitution.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a nucleophilic substitution. The norbornene compound has a tert-butoxy group. Oh wait, no, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy) bicyclo... so the oxygen is an ether. The norbornene system has an ether substituent. But the main thing is that when it's treated with a dihalide and a base, perhaps we're looking at a ring-opening or some coupling.

Wait, the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,
