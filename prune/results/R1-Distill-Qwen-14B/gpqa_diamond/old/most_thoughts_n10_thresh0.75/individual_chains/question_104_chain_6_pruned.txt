Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The idea is that the planet causes the star to wobble, and we can detect this wobble by shifts in the spectral lines.

The problem states that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, and the planets are similarly massive, but their Doppler shifts are different.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is understanding what factors affect the Doppler shift observed. The RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh, but since both planets are detected, the orbits must be edge-on enough (high enough inclination) for us to see the shift. So maybe inclination isn't varying here, or it's considered the same for both.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula. I recall that K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. Or maybe the formula is K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P * (2Ï€))^(1/3) * c )) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I'm just thinking through it. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but I might be mixing up the exponents.

Wait, the formula for K, the RV semi-amplitude, is something like:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c)) )^(1/3)

Wait, I think that's not quite right. Let me think again.

I think the correct formula is K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_*^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV method's semi-amplitude can be approximated as:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can think that for a given planet mass and star mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube
