Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The researcher used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the target gene. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, so the anti-nutritional compound is bad, and they want to stop its synthesis. That probably means they want to disrupt the gene so it doesn't produce the compound. So, the idea is that the mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene product—maybe a nonfunctional enzyme that can't make the compound.

Looking at the sequences given. The intact gene is the wild type. Each mutant has a change in the first exon area. Exons are the coding regions, so changes there could affect the protein.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the wild type.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, I'll compare each part. Let's see: the first part is ATGTTTCTCG... for the wild type. In Mutant1, it's ATGTTCTACG... So, let's break down the first few codons.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAAC ATAT TATTGTCGC...
Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are. Let me align them.

Looking at the first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...

Wait, no, perhaps better to write the differences.

Alternatively, perhaps I should see which mutations cause a frameshift or a missense mutation that disrupts the protein.

Looking for stop codons might be key because a premature stop would truncate the protein, possibly making it nonfunctional.

Wait, the question doesn't specify if the mutations are in exons or introns. But since all the mutations are in the first exon area, which is coding, the changes are in the exons, so they affect the protein.

Let's look for each mutant. I'll compare each to the wild type:

Wild type: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

Mutant1:
Looking at the sequence, the first part where it differs from wild type is in the third codon after ATG. Let me count the nucleotides:

Wild: position 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, etc.

Mutant1 at position 7-9: CTA (instead of CTC?), wait wait let me look again.

Wait, the full sequences:

Wild: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, so in Mutant1, after the TTT, it's CTA CGC TGG TAC... Hmm, so in the wild type, it's CTC GCT GGT ACT. Let's write the wild type's first exons:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC.

So, in Mutant1, the first change is at position where the wild has CTC GCT, mutant has CTA CGC.

Wait, the first few codons:

Wild: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), TTG (Leu), TCG (Ser)... 

Mutant1: ATG, TTT, CTA (Leu?), CGC (Arg?), TGG (Trp?), TAC (Tyr?), TTCT (maybe a frame shift?), etc.

Wait, maybe looking for where the reading frame changes. Let me count the nucleotides.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each mutation.

Looking for changes that introduce a stop codon. Because if a stop codon occurs early, the protein would be truncated. That could disrupt the function.

So, for
