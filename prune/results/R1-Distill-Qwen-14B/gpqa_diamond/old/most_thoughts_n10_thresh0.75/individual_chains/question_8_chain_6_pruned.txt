Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about gene interactions in plants related to disease resistance. Let me read through the question again and take notes.

So, the setup is that we've got three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in white lupine. They were identified as candidates for resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. We made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

We know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. The question is about figuring out the relationships between these genes based on the mutant resistance data.

The data given is the resistance percentage compared to the wild type. Higher means more resistance, right? So, 100% is the control (wild type), and lower numbers mean more susceptibility.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → so more susceptible than wild type. 75% is three-fourths, so less resistance.
- g2: 0% → super susceptible, all plants infected. So, without G2, they can't resist at all.
- g3: 50% → half resistance, so more susceptible than wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → very little resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm, okay. So, the double mutants involving g2 all have 0% resistance. That suggests that when G2 is knocked out, regardless of the other genes, the plant can't resist the disease. So if g2 is non-functional, the resistance is gone. That makes me think that G2 is upstream or is necessary for the resistance pathway.

Looking at the single mutants: g2 is the most severe, which suggests that G2 is critical. Because even a single knockout of G2 wipes out all resistance, it's probably a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for defense. So G2 might be the transcription factor upstream.

Now, the other single mutants: g1 has 75% resistance. So, they're more susceptible but not completely. This means G1's product contributes to resistance but isn't absolutely necessary. Because without it, the plant can still resist at 75%. Similarly, g3 has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1, but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance plummets. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, maybe working redundantly or in a linear way.

So let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, then the expression of Gene B's phenotype is dependent on Gene A. So, if a double mutant of A and B has the same phenotype as a single A mutant, A is epistatic to B.

Looking at the data:

When g2 is knocked out, all the double mutants (g1g2, g2g3, g1g2g3) have 0% resistance. Wait, but wait, what about the double mutants without g2?

Wait, the double mutants given are g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. So, for example, the g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So together, they're worse than either alone. That suggests that their contributions are additive or maybe they function in separate pathways. But when both are knocked out, the effect is more severe.

Wait, but when G2 is present, like in G1 and G2 both being functional (the wild type), then maybe G1 and G3 are in a pathway downstream of G2. So, G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So, if G2 is not working, neither are G1 and G3.

But wait, in the single mutants, the g1 and g3 have partial resistance. That suggests that even without G1 or G3, some other genes are providing some resistance. So G2 might be a transcription factor activating other genes besides G1 and G3, or perhaps G1 and G3 aren't the only ones in that pathway.

Wait, but the results show that the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are as bad as g2 alone, which is
