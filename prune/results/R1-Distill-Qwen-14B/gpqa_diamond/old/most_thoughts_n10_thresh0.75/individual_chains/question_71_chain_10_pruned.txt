Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

First, the question says that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered via the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The planets have the same albedo, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right. The formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is based on the inverse square law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) / (sqrt( (1 - A) ) ), where A is the albedo. But since all planets have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the key factors are the star's temperature (T_star) and the planet's orbital distance (a). But since the question doesn't mention the star varying, I can assume T_star is the same for all. So the temperature ratio will depend on the square root of the ratio of their distances.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Or is it directly proportional? I think I'm mixing up the period and the distance here.

Oh wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So for a star like our Sun, P² is proportional to a³. So the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of a. But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), substituting that in, T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(P^(2/3)) ) = 1 / (P^(1/3)) ).

So T is proportional to P^(-1/3). Because if a planet's period is P, then T scales as P^(-1/3).

Wait, let me double-check. The equilibrium temperature
