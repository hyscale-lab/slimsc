Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about nucleophilicity and arranging nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, I should consider the effect of solvation. In polar protic solvents like water, strong nucleophiles are often not very reactive because they get solvated tightly. So the more polarizable and less solvated a nucleophile is, the more reactive it will be.

Let me list out the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (which is a conjugate base of a tertiary alcohol)
2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻)
3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻, since ethanethiol is CH3CH2SH, so the conjugate base is CH3CH2S⁻)

Wait, wait. No, wait. Ethanethiolate would be CH3CH2S⁻. Right.

So, I need to order these from most reactive (strongest nucleophile) to least reactive.

In aqueous solution, the order is usually influenced by both the basicity and the ability to shed solvent molecules. In polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity trends can differ from their basicity trends because of solvation. So, stronger bases are not necessarily better nucleophiles in such solvents if they are highly solvated.

Let me think about the basicity of these nucleophiles. Stronger bases are generally better nucleophiles, but in polar protic solvents, the strongest bases may be too stabilized by solvation to act as good nucleophiles.

So, the basicity order might help, but I have to adjust for solvation effects.

Looking at the given nucleophiles:

Hydroxide (OH⁻) is a stronger base than ethanethiolate (HS⁻) because S is larger, so the HS⁻ ion is a weaker base. Wait, wait, no. Actually, size matters. S is bigger, so the S⁻ ion is less stabilized than OH⁻. Wait, no. Wait, I think that the conjugate acid strength relates inversely to the strength of the base. So, since H2S is a weaker acid than H2O, HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻. Wait, no. Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me think clearly.

Conjugate acid strength: If HA is a strong acid, A⁻ is a weak base. For example, HCl is a strong acid, so Cl⁻ is a weak base. Conversely, if HA is weak, A⁻ is strong. So, H2O is a weaker acid than H2S. No, wait, wait. Wait, actually, H2S is a weaker acid than H2O. Because water is more polar and can stabilize the negative charge better. So in the gas phase, H2S is a weaker acid than H2O, so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let's get this straight.

The acid strength order in water: H2O is a weaker acid than H2S. Wait, no, wait. No, I think H2S is a weaker acid than H2O. Let me recall the pKa values. H2O has a pKa around 15.7, while H2S has a pKa around 7. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. Wait, no, that can't be because H2S is a weaker acid. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Remember, lower pKa means stronger acid. So H2S has a pKa of about 7, H2O has a pKa of about 15.7. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. So its conjugate base HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Because the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base.

So, basicity order: OH⁻ is a stronger base than HS⁻. So OH⁻ is a stronger base. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because I seem to remember that in aqueous solution, thiolates are stronger bases than the corresponding hydroxide ions. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think about pKa values. The pKa of H2S is about 7, so HS⁻ has a pKa2 around 19. H2O has pKa 15.7, so OH⁻ comes from that. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ because the conjugate acid (H2S) is stronger. So OH⁻ is a stronger base.

Wait, no, wait: Let me get this straight. For H2O and H2S:

H2O: pKa ~15.7
H2S: pKa ~7
