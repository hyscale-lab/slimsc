Okay, so I've got this question about immunology and the processes happening in the immune system. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves rotavirus tagged with GFP. They delivered it to mice via oral gavage. From the experiment, they observed a couple of things: some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability.

Hmm, what's going on here. So, Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized areas where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated. So, when the rotavirus is delivered orally, it probably gets taken up by these patches.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. I'm guessing that as the virus is processed in the gut, the capsid proteins are exposed, allowing the immune system to detect them. But some are destroyed by stomach acid which might break down some antigens, but others make it through. The ones that reach the Peyer's patches would then be processed by the immune cells there.

They isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in the immune context are likely B cells, which are dividing and differentiating after being activated by an antigen. High variability in the variable heavy chain genesâ€”wait, the variable regions are where the diversity comes from in antibodies. So, each B cell has a slightly different variable region, allowing for a broad range of antigen recognition.

But what process causes this high variability? Let's think about the options.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. That's a process that happens in B cells after the initial immune response, especially during the germinal center reactions. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This could lead to high variability in the variable heavy chains.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. Not directly related to the variability in variable regions.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but doesn't change the variable regions themselves. So it wouldn't explain the variability in the variable heavy chains.

Option D: VDJ recombination. That's the process during B cell and T cell development in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. It's how the variable, diversity, and joining regions are combined to create diverse receptors. But this happens early on, during the maturation of the immune cells, not in response to a specific antigen. So after the initial setup, during an immune response, VDJ isn't happening again. So the high variability observed here wouldn't be due to VDJ.

Wait, but the question says that the cells were isolated from the Peyer's patches after the GFP was delivered. So this is a response to the rotavirus antigen. The variable regions are already set during the maturation of the B cells (VDJ), but the high variability in the variable heavy chains suggests that something is changing them after the initial setup. So that points towards somatic hypermutation, which can increase the diversity of the antibodies during the immune response.

So the process that's taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence of some GFP molecules is destroyed by stomach acid, while others reach the Peyer's patches, where they are processed by the immune system. The Peyer's patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the gut where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that increases diversity in the immune response. Among the options:

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation** is a process that occurs during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions to increase diversity and affinity of their antibodies. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chains.
- **Option B: Complement activation** is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of antibodies.
- **Option C: Class switching recombination** changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions themselves, so it cannot explain the observed variability.
- **Option D: VDJ recombination** occurs during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow, where the variable, diversity, and joining regions of the B cell receptor are combined. However, this process occurs early in immune cell development and does not explain the variability observed during an immune response to a specific antigen.

The high variability in the variable heavy chains is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response to increase diversity and specificity of antibodies. 

Answer: A
