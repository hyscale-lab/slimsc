Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are about different power laws.

Wait, parallax. Parallax is related to distance. Right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax. So we're looking at how many stars there are when we consider a small range of parallax values. Let's say we pick a range from plx to plx + dplx. How does the count of stars in that range depend on plx?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is uniform in some way. Wait, but in 3D space? So maybe I should think in terms of volume. Because the number of stars depends on the volume of space we're considering.

In a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region. So let's imagine that we're considering a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of such a shell would be 4πd² dd, right? Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between r and r+dr is approximately 4πr² dr.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then plx ranges from high values (close stars) to low values (far away). So if I have a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance?

Let me express d in terms of plx. d = 1/plx. So, the distance between two parallax values would be, say, plx and plx + dplx. Let me see, when plx changes by dplx, how does d change?

Taking d = 1/plx, the derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So the change in distance dd is approximately -dplx/(plx²). But since d is positive and plx is positive, perhaps I should think in terms of the absolute values.
