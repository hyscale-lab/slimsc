Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is made of elements X and Y, and it's currently in its fundamental state. We need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will take the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, I remember that in such models, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either change its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. But the question is about the next state with the lowest energy, so I think that means the smallest possible energy increase, which would likely be a transition to the next vibrational state, since vibrational energy changes are generally larger than rotational ones. Wait, no, wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (which is the ground rotational state, typically J=0 or J=1, depending on the molecule's symmetry). 

Wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational quantum number J can start at J=0, but sometimes the ground state is J=1. Oh right, because for a diatomic like O2, which is a homonuclear, the J=0 state is not allowed due to symmetry, so the ground state is J=1. But in this problem, since the masses of X and Y are different (20 amu and 2 amu), I think it's a heteronuclear diatomic, so the rotational states can have J=0,1,2,... So the ground state would likely be J=0 in the v=0 vibrational state.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state after the fundamental state would probably be the next vibrational state, v=1, with J=0 again? Or perhaps the next rotational state, J=1, in the same vibrational state? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about which transition gives the lower energy change. Let me think: the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model (which includes both vibration and rotation) are given by the sum of vibrational and rotational energies.

The energy for the vibration is quantized and given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h w_vib, where w_vib is the vibrational angular frequency. The rotational energy is E_J = [ (J)(J+1) ] h c_e / (R^2), but wait, no, the rotational energy is actually E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

Wait, correcting myself: For a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B = (h²)/(8 π² μ R²), and μ is the reduced mass. The vibrational energy is E_v = (v + 1/2) h w_vib.

So the total energy is E = E_v + E_J.

The fundamental state is the state with the lowest energy, which is v=0 and J=0, I think. Wait, but sometimes for certain molecules, J=0 might be forbidden. But in this case, since X and Y have different masses, the molecule is heteronuclear, so J can be zero. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy could be either increasing J (to J=1) in the same vibrational state, or increasing v to 1 with J=0. Which of these transitions requires less energy? Because the question is about the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should be the smallest possible increment that can cause a transition.

So I need to calculate the energy difference for both possible transitions and see which is smaller.

First, calculate the energy required to go from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1.

Second, calculate the energy required to go from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0.

The photon's energy should match the smallest of these two. So I'll compute both and compare.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the reduced mass μ.
   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)
   Given Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

2. Convert μ to kg because Planck's constant h is in SI units. 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (let me calculate that) 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

3. Calculate the rotational constant B. B = h²/(8 π² μ R²). Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

   Let's compute B:

   h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s.

   So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² * μ * (2e-10)^2 )

   Let me compute numerator and denominator.

   Numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

   Denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.87 ≈78.96.

   μ is approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

   (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

   So denominator overall: 78.96 * 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 78.96 *3.018e-27 *4e-20.

   Let's compute that:

   78.96 *4 ≈ 315.84.

   3.018e-27 * 1e-20 =3.018e-47.

   So denominator: 315.84 *3.018e-47 ≈ 952.2e-47 ≈9.522e-45.

   So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.522e-45 ≈ 4.39e-67 /9.522e-45 = approx 4.39/9.522e-22 ≈ 0.4605e-22 ≈4.605e-23 J.

   Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the calculation again.

   Wait, wait, B is in units of J, but actually, no, rotational constants are often expressed in cm^-1 or other units, but wait, in any case, let me compute it correctly.

   Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate:

   Let me compute each part step by step.

   Denominator: 8 * π² * μ * R².

   8 * π² ≈ 78.96.

   μ ≈3.018e-27 kg.

   R²= (2e-10 m)^2 =4e-20 m².

   So 78.96 *3.018e-27 *4e-20.

   Let's compute constants first: 78.96 *3.018 ≈ 78.96 *3=236.88, 78.96 *0.018≈1.421, so total ≈238.3.

   Then, 238.3 *4 ≈953.2.

   So the denominator is 953.2e-27 * e-20 = 953.2e-47 ≈9.532e-45.

   So denominator is 9.532e-45.

   Numerator is h²= (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

   So B= 4.39e-67 / 9.532e-45 = 4.39 /9.532e-22 ≈0.460e-22 ≈4.60e-23 J.

   Wait that's 4.6e-23 J. But this seems very small. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it differently.

   Alternatively, maybe I should compute B in terms of cm^-1? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B as (h²)/(8 π² μ R²). Let me compute each component again.

   h =6.626e-34 J·s.

   h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

   8 π² ≈ 78.96.

   μ= 20*2/(20+2) amu =40/22 amu≈1.818 amu. 1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg, so μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.018e-27 kg.

   R=2 angstroms=2e-10 meters.

   R^2=4e-20 m².

   So denominator is 78.96 *3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =78.96 *3.018e-27 *4e-20.

   Let's compute 78.96 *3.018e-27 first: 78.96 *3.018 ≈238.3, so 238.3e-27.

   Multiply by 4e-20: 238.3e-27 *4e-20 = 953.2e-47 =9.532e-45.

   So B=4.39e-67 /9.532e-45 = (4.39 /9.532) *1e-22 ≈0.460e-22 =4.60e-23 J.

   That seems correct.

   Now, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). So from J=0 to J=1, the energy change ΔE_rot = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) = 2B.

   So ΔE_rot = 2B =2 *4.6e-23 J=9.2e-23 J.

   Now, for the vibrational energy. The vibrational energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h w_vib. So the change from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = (1.5 h w_vib) - (0.5 h w_vib) )= h w_vib.

   So ΔE_vib = h * w_vib. Given w_vib =4e14 rad/s.

   So ΔE_vib =6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

   So now compare the two possible transitions:

   - Rotational: ΔE_rot ≈9.2e-23 J.

   - Vibrational: ΔE_vib ≈2.65e-19 J.

   The rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the molecule would preferentially undergo a rotational transition if possible. But wait, wait. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state in energy after the fundamental state would be the one with the smallest possible ΔE. So the rotational transition is much smaller in energy, so the photon needed would have energy equal to ΔE_rot.

   But wait, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. So the next possible state would be the next lowest energy state, which is either J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0.

   Since ΔE_rot is much smaller than ΔE_vib, the next state with the lowest possible energy is J=1, v=0.

   So the photon's energy should match ΔE_rot, which is approximately 9.2e-23 J.

   Now, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. The momentum p of a photon is related to its energy E by E = p c, where c is the speed of light.

   So p = E / c.

   So E_photon = ΔE_rot =9.2e-23 J.

   c=3e8 m/s.

   So p= (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2 /3) e-31 kg·m/s ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

   Wait, that's 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But looking at the options, they are on the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27 N·s.

   Wait, but 1 N·s is equal to 1 kg·m/s. So the p is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 N·s.

   But none of the options are that small. The options are all around 1e-27 or 1e-28 N·s. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

   Let me check where I could have gone wrong.

   Wait, perhaps I got the energy levels mixed up. Maybe the molecule can't have J=0 in the fundamental state. Wait, no, for a heteronuclear diatomic, J can be zero, so that's correct.

   Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing B.

   Let me recompute B.

   B = h^2/(8 π² μ R²).

   Let me compute each part again.

   h =6.626e-34 J·s.

   h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

   8 π² = 8*(pi^2) =8*(9.8696)=78.9568.

   μ=1.818 amu =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.018e-27 kg.

   R=2e-10 m.

   R squared is 4e-20 m².

   So denominator: 78.9568 *3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

   Compute 78.9568 *4 =315.827.

   Then, 315.827 *3.018e-27 = let's compute 315.827 *3.018 = approx 315 *3=945, 315 *0.018=5.67, so about 950.67. So 950.67e-27.

   Then multiply by 1e-20: 950.67e-27 *1e-20 =9.5067e-25.

   So denominator is 9.5067e-25.

   So B=4.39e-67 /9.5067e-25 = (4.39 /9.5067) * 1e-42 ≈0.4618e-42 ≈4.618e-43 J.

   Wait, that's a completely different number. So B is approximately 4.6e-43 J.

   Then, the energy change when J increases from 0 to 1 is 2B = 2*4.6e-43 =9.2e-43 J.

   So the energy required is 9.2e-43 J.

   Then, the photon's momentum p = E/c =9.2e-43 J /3e8 m/s = 3.067e-51 kg·m/s.

   Wait, that's way smaller than the options given, which are in 1e-27 N·s (which is 1e-27 kg·m/s).

   So something's definitely wrong. Maybe I messed up the calculation of B.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of wavenumbers or other units?

   Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the rotational constant in terms of bond length and mass:

   B = (h/(8 π² c μ R² )) * c, but I'm getting confused here.

   Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula that B (in cm^-1) is given by (h c)/(8 π² μ R²), where c is the speed of light.

   Let me try that. Because sometimes B is expressed in wavenumbers (cm^-1), which is energy per photon (E = hcν).

   So, let's compute B in cm^-1:

   B = (h c)/(8 π² μ R²)

   h=6.626e-34 J·s.

   c=3e8 m/s.

   μ=3.018e-27 kg.

   R=2e-10 m.

   R^2=4e-20 m².

   So B = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (8 π² *3.018e-27 *4e-20)

   Let me compute numerator and denominator.

   Numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

   Denominator:8 π² ≈78.96.

   So denominator:78.96 *3.018e-27 *4e-20.

   Let me compute 78.96 *3.018e-27 =78.96 *3.018 ≈238.3 *1e-27 =2.383e-25.

   Multiply by 4e-20: 2.383e-25 *4e-20 =9.532e-45.

   So B =1.9878e-25 /9.532e-45 = (1.9878 /9.532) *1e20 ≈0.2084 *1e20 =2.084e19 cm^-1.

   Wait, that can't be right. Because rotational constants are usually on the order of cm^-1 in the range of 1e-2 to 1e3. 2e19 cm^-1 would be way too large.

   Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

   Wait, the denominator is 8 π² μ R². Let me compute each part again.

   8 π^2 =78.96.

   μ=3.018e-27 kg.

   R²=4e-20 m².

   So denominator: 78.96 *3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

   Compute 78.96 *3.018e-27 = 78.96 *3.018 = let's compute 78 *3=234, 78 *0.018=1.404, 0.96 *3=2.88, 0.96 *0.018=0.01728. So total approx 234 +1.404 +2.88 +0.01728 ≈238.299. So 238.3e-27.

   Multiply by 4e-20: 238.3e-27 *4e-20 =953.2e-47 =9.532e-45.

   So denominator is 9.532e-45.

   So B= (1.9878e-25) / (9.532e-45) = (1.9878 /9.532) *1e20 ≈0.2084 *1e20=2.084e19 cm^-1.

   That's way too high, which can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

   Wait, perhaps the formula for B in cm^-1 is B = (h c)/(8 π² μ R²) [cm^-1].

   But let me think, the units:

   h has units J·s = (kg·m²/s²)·s = kg·m²/s.

   c is m/s.

   μ is kg.

   R is in m.

   So the denominator is in kg * m².

   So numerator (h c) is (kg·m²/s) * (m/s) ) = kg·m³/s².

   Denominator is 8 π^2 μ R^2 = kg * m².

   So overall, (kg m³/s²) / (kg m²) )= m/s. So B would have units of m/s.

   Hmm, that makes sense because rotational constants can be expressed in terms of m/s.

   Wait, but I thought B was in cm^-1. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing different expressions.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of Joules.

   Let me try to compute B again.

   B = h^2/(8 π² μ R²).

   h=6.626e-34 J·s.

   So h^2=4.39e-67 J² s².

   8 π² μ R² =8*(pi)^2 *3.018e-27 kg*(2e-10 m)^2.

   Let me compute R² again: 4e-20 m².

   So 8 pi² *3.018e-27 =78.96 *3.018e-27 =2.38e-25.

   Multiply by 4e-20: 2.38e-25 *4e-20=9.52e-45.

   So denominator is 9.52e-45.

   B=4.39e-67 /9.52e-45≈4.6e-23 J.

   So B is about 4.6e-23 J.

   Then, the energy change for J=0→1 is 2B=9.2e-23 J.

   So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J. Then, the momentum p = E/c.

   E =9.2e-23 J.

   c=3e8 m/s.

   So p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 N·s.

   But the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So there's a discrepancy here.

   Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the question is considering the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the model.

   Wait, another thought. The non-rigid rotor model (also called the rotation-vibration model) treats the bond as having variable length, so the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. But perhaps the problem is simplifying it by treating rotation and vibration separately. Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are considered as a sum of both rotational and vibrational energies.

   The question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so v=0 and J=0.

   The next state with the lowest possible energy could be either J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0. Depending on which requires less energy.

   Earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires much less energy: 9.2e-23 J vs 2.65e-19 J. So the lower energy transition is the rotational one.

   So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J, and the momentum p=E/c=3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 N·s.

   But the options don't have this value. Let me check the options again.

   Options:
   A) 1.9e-28 Ns
   B)2.3e-27 Ns
   C)1.1e-27 Ns
   D)1.4e-28 Ns

   None match 3e-31. So perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating B.

   Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for B. Let me double-check the formula for the rotational constant.

   The rotational constant B is given by:

   B = (h^2) / (8 π² μ R^2)

   So that's correct.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the moment of inertia I = μ R², and B is h/(8 π² I) in J.

   So I can compute I = μ R².

   I = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.207e-46 kg·m².

   Then, B = h^2/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi^2 *1.207e-46).

   Let me compute numerator and denominator.

   Numerator:6.626e-34^2=4.39e-67.

   Denominator:8 pi² *1.207e-46 =78.96 *1.207e-46≈78.96 *1.207≈95.2, so 95.2e-46=9.52e-45.

   So B=4.39e-67 /9.52e-45 ≈4.61e-23 J, which is the same as before.

   So the calculation of B is correct. Then, the energy change is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 N·s. But the options are much larger.

   Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the energy of a photon. The energy of a photon is E = h f, and momentum p = E/c = h f /c = h/(lambda) * 1/c = h/(c lambda). But another way is E = p c. So p = E/c.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the wavelength or frequency, but that doesn't change the calculation.

   Another approach: compute p in terms of B.

   Since E=2B, p=2B/(c).

   So p=2*(4.6e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

   Same result.

   Hmm. Now I'm really confused because none of the options match. Maybe I should check if the problem is considering the next state as a vibrational transition instead.

   If the photon's energy is 2.65e-19 J, then p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

   Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. 8.8e-28 isn't an option. So perhaps the transition is not vibrational but something else.

   Wait, perhaps the model requires that the photon's energy corresponds to both a vibrational and rotational transition. For example, the molecule could transition to v=1 and J=1, but that would require more energy than either transition alone, which doesn't make sense since the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy.

   Alternatively, perhaps the model allows for the simultaneous change in both J and v, but that's not the case for the lowest energy transition.

   Alternatively, perhaps I've confused the concept of the fundamental state. Maybe the fundamental state isn't v=0, J=0, but perhaps a different combination.

   Wait, another thought: the quantum rotation-vibration model sometimes combines the rotational and vibrational energies, and the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state. So in that case, the next state could be the next vibrational state with J=0, which would be the first overtone.

   But since the vibrational energy change is much larger, the photon would have to have a much higher energy. So perhaps the question is asking about the vibrational transition.

   But why are the options in the 1e-27 or 1e-28 range? Let's see.

   Let me recompute the vibrational energy.

   w_vib is given as 4e14 rad/s.

   So E_vib = h w_vib =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

   So p=E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

   None of the options match this. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). But 8.8e-28 isn't an option.

   Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition from J=0 to J=1, which requires 2B, but B is so small that the momentum is negligible. But that brings us back to the same issue.

   Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

   Let me recalculate the reduced mass.

   Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

   So μ=(20*2)/(20+2) =40/22=1.818 amu.

   1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg.

   So μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 3.018e-27 kg. That's correct.

   Alternatively, perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, but I used it in meters. Wait, R is 2 angstroms which is 2e-10 meters, which is correct.

   I'm getting stuck here. Let me think if there's another approach. Maybe the problem is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the first overtone (v=2, J=0), but that's not the next state in energy. The next state would be v=1, J=0, which is higher in energy than J=1, v=0.

   Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition to the next possible state, regardless of being vibrational or rotational. But in that case, the smallest energy change is the rotational one, but how the options don't match.

   Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for R. If R were in a different unit, say picometers or something, but the question says 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the next state is the first excited state, which could be a combination of both. But that's unclear.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, not energy. But that's unlikely.

   Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the model being used is the rigid rotor, not the non-rigid one. But the question states it's the non-rigid rotor model, so that's probably not the issue.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it and transitions to the next energy level. But in that case, I'm not seeing any option that matches the calculated momentum.

   Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the energy change in rotation.

   The energy levels for rotation are E_J = B J (J+1). So ΔE = B [ J'(J'+1) - J (J+1) ].

   For J=0 to J=1, ΔE= B(2-0) =2B.

   So that's correct.

   Alternatively, perhaps the model includes both rotational and vibrational changes. But that would require more energy.

   Wait, perhaps the molecule can't have J=0, but must have J=1 in the fundamental state. For example, in O2, which is homonuclear, J must be even. But in this case, since X and Y have different masses, J can be 0,1,2,...

   So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

   Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of J=1 and v=1, but that would require even more energy.

   Another approach: looking at the options, the options are around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

   Let me compute what energy would correspond to these momenta.

   For example, option C is 1.1e-27 Ns.

   E = p c =1.1e-27 kg·m/s *3e8 m/s=3.3e-19 J.

   Which is similar to the vibrational energy I calculated earlier (2.65e-19 J). So perhaps the correct photon energy is 2.65e-19 J, which would correspond to a momentum of 8.83e-28 N·s. But this isn't one of the given options.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the vibrational transition but I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate E_vib.

   E_vib = h w_vib =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. Correct.

   So p=2.65e-19 /3e8≈8.83e-28 N·s.

   No option matches this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

   Another thought: perhaps the model considers the vibrational energy with a different frequency, but the given w is 4e14 rad/s, which I used.

   Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the vibrational frequency in terms of wavenumbers, not angular frequency.

   Wait, vibrational wavenumber is usually given as ~w/(2 pi c), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy as E_vib = h c w̃, where w̃ is the wavenumber.

   But the given w is the angular frequency, so E_vib = h w, which is correct.

   Another possibility: perhaps the problem considers the transition to the next state as a combination of a rotational and vibrational change, but that's more complicated and not the minimal energy change.

   Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (v=0, J=1), requiring ΔE=2B, which we calculated as 9.2e-23 J. So the momentum is ~3e-31 N·s, but that's way smaller than any option.

   Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model where the next state is the first overtone (v=2, J=0), but that would require even more energy.

   I'm stuck. Let me think about the options.

   The options are:

   A)1.9e-28

   B)2.3e-27

   C)1.1e-27

   D)1.4e-28

   The only options in the 1e-28 range are A, D, and maybe C if it's 1.1e-27. Wait, 1.1e-27 is larger than 1e-28.

   Earlier, for the vibrational transition, I got p=8.83e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not quite. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

   Wait, let me recompute E_vib.

   E_vib = h w_vib.

   h=6.626e-34 J·s.

   w_vib=4e14 rad/s.

   So E=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

   Then, p= E/c=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 Ns.

   So approximately 8.8e-28 Ns.

   None of the options match. The closest is option A (1.9e-28), which is about a quarter of that.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for h, like h=4.135667696e-15 eV·s. But that's in eV·s. Let me compute E in eV.

   E_vib =2.65e-19 J =2.65e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈1.65 eV.

   Hmm, but that doesn't help with the momentum calculation.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's wavelength.

   lambda = h/(E)=6.626e-34 /2.65e-19 ≈2.5e-15 m.

   Which is 2.5 femtometers, which is very small, but I don't see how that helps.

   Another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the momentum, and perhaps I should express it in terms of the reduced mass and bond length, but I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition to the next vibrational state but using only part of the energy, but that doesn't make sense.

   Alternatively, perhaps I've messed up the formula for the rotational energy. Wait, the rotational energy is E_J = (J(J+1) h c )/(8 pi² mu R²), which is the same as B J(J+1). So the earlier calculation would be correct.

   Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

   Wait, perhaps I forgot that the vibrational transition involves a change in vibrational state only, but when the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state (v=1, J=0) would require more energy than the rotational transition. So the photon's energy should be 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

   But 9.2e-23 J/c = 3e-31 Ns.

   So the answer must be 3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which is 8.8e-28 Ns. But that's not an option either.

   Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition to the next state in terms of energy, not the minimal possible. But I thought the question says 'lowest possible energy'.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition to the next possible energy level, which could be either a rotational or vibrational transition. But since vibrational transitions are forbidden unless certain conditions are met (like dipole moment change), but that's more in the realm of selection rules, which the problem doesn't mention.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor, which doesn't include vibrational transitions. So the only possible transition is rotational.

   If the molecule can only change its rotational state, the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns. But no option matches.

   Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the question is about the photon's energy causing the molecule to transition to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, regardless of whether it's the lowest energy. But that would require knowing which transition is allowed.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibration energy differently. Let me see if I can recalculate the vibrational energy.

   Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is 2h w_vib, because each vibrational quantum is 2h w_vib?

   No, wait. The energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h w_vib. So the change from v=0 to v=1 is h w_vib.

   So my earlier calculation is correct.

   Hmm.

   Given that none of the options match either of the two transitions, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

   Let me try to compute B again, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

   B = h²/(8 π² μ R²) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² *3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 )

   Numerator:6.626e-34^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

   Denominator:8 π^2 ≈78.96.

   μ=3.018e-27 kg.

   R^2 =4e-20 m².

   So denominator:78.96 *3.018e-27 = (78.96 *3.018) = approx 238.3e-27.

   Multiply by 4e-20:238.3e-27 *4e-20 =953.2e-47 =9.532e-45.

   So B=4.39e-67 /9.532e-45 ≈4.60e-23 J.

   So the energy change is 9.2e-23 J.

   So p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

   Still not matching any option.

   Perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the question is referring to the vibrational transition, and perhaps the given options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

   Alternatively, perhaps the energy is being considered as 1/2 h w_vib, which would be 1.325e-19 J, leading to p=4.42e-28 Ns. Still not matching any option.

   Another idea: perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the wavelength corresponding to the vibrational energy.

   lambda = h/(E) =6.626e-34 /2.65e-19 ≈2.5e-15 m.

   So p = E/(c) =2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈8.83e-28 Ns.

   Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next rotational state plus the vibrational state, but that would require more energy.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the force instead of momentum, but that's not relevant here.

   Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

   The calculated vibrational transition gives p≈8.8e-28 Ns, which is closest to option A (1.9e-28) but not very close. Alternatively, none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

   Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of B and should recheck.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the next state as the first overtone, which would be v=2, but that's higher energy.

   Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state in terms of the rotational energy, which is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns, but none of the options match.

   Alternatively, perhaps the model being used is the rigid rotor, where the moment of inertia is constant, but the problem states non-rigid rotor.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the next state is the first vibrational level, which requires a photon with energy h w_vib, leading to p=8.8e-28 Ns. But again, no option matches.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational frequency as w/2pi, which would change the energy.

   Wait, angular frequency w is 2 pi times the frequency f. So if the given w is 4e14 rad/s, then the frequency f is w/(2 pi)= ~6.366e13 Hz.

   But that doesn't change the energy calculation because E=h w = h *2 pi f.

   Wait, no, because E= h w, which is correct.

   Hmm. I think I'm stuck and have to make a choice.

   Looking at the options, the only one in the 1e-28 range is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). Since my vibrational calculation gives 8.8e-28, which is about 4.4 times larger than option A. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should use the vibrational frequency in terms of cm^-1. Wait, but the given w is in rad/s.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the wavenumber in cm^-1, but I'm not sure.

   Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions. But that's more energy.

   Another thought: perhaps the model being used treats the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, where the energy levels are equally spaced. The transition would be from v=0 to v=1, requiring E=h w.

   So p= E/c = h w /c.

   Let me compute that.

   E=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

   p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

   So again, no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's not possible.

   Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units when calculating B. Let me double-check.

   Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, but I used it in meters. No, I correctly converted 2 angstroms to 2e-10 m.

   Hmm.

   I'm out of ideas. Perhaps the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I don't see how that would come about.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the energy for a transition to J=1, which is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option.

   Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the transition to the next state as the next quantum state, which could be a combination of J and v. But without more information, I can't proceed.

   I'm forced to conclude that I've made a mistake somewhere, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns, but I can't justify it.

   Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy as E_J = (J)(J+1) h c_e / (8 pi^2 mu R^2), where c_e is the speed of light? No, that doesn't make sense because c_e is a constant.

   Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but I can't see how that would change the momentum calculation.

   Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given in bohr radii, but the problem states angstroms.

   Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the change in vibrational state, but the energy is (3/2) h w_vib instead of h w_vib. But I don't think that's correct.

   Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the next allowed state, which is a combination of J=1 and v=0, requiring 2B. But earlier calculations show that this leads to a very small p.

   In conclusion, I think the correct calculation leads to a momentum of approximately 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, and the correct answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis considers both rotational and vibrational transitions:

1. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_J = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2} \).  
   - Reduced mass \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).  
   - Bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
   - Rotational constant \( B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  
   - Energy change for \( J=0 \to J=1 \): \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  
   - Photon momentum: \( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \).  
   This value is far smaller than any of the given options.

2. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_v = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega_{\text{vib}} \).  
   - Vibrational angular frequency \( \omega_{\text{vib}} = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).  
   - Energy change for \( v=0 \to v=1 \): \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).  
   - Photon momentum: \( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).  
   This value is also not listed among the options.

3. **Comparison of Transitions**:  
   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)) is far smaller than any of the given options. The vibrational transition momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)) is closer to the options but still does not match exactly.

4. **Given Options**:  
   The options provided are:  
   - (A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)  
   - (B) \( 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)  
   - (C) \( 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)  
   - (D) \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)  

   None of these match the calculated values for either transition. The closest option to the vibrational transition is (A), but it is still not a perfect match. Given the lack of alignment between the calculated values and the provided options, the most reasonable choice based on the analysis is **(C)**, as it is the only option in the \( 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \) range, which might correspond to a miscalculation or approximation in the problem setup.

Answer: C
