Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to remember what I can.

The question says that a quasar's observations in the near-infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, wait, I think this relates to the Lyman-alpha forest or something about absorption lines. Oh wait, no, Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But quasars can have emission lines too.

Wait, another thought: redshift. The peak at 790 nm might be the observed wavelength. If the rest wavelength is something else, like the Lyman-alpha emission line at 121 nm, then we can calculate the redshift. But wait, quasars emit in various lines. Let me think: the Lyman-alpha emission line is about 121 nm, but maybe the peak here is from something else.

Wait, 790 nm is in the near-infrared. I remember that for distant objects, their light is redshifted. So if the quasar emits in the optical or ultraviolet, but we see it in the infrared, that would mean a high redshift.

Wait, what's the typical rest wavelength for certain emission lines? Let's see. The Lyman-alpha line is about 121 nm (far UV), the Balmer-alpha (H-alpha) is about 656 nm (red
