Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized, right? The sum of the squares of the absolute values should equal 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. Maybe I need to normalize it first before proceeding. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the column matrix is given as (-1, 2, 1), but perhaps that's a typo? Or maybe I'm supposed to use it as is without normalization. I'll keep that in mind.

The problem mentions two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given by square matrices. The matrix for P has specific elements. Let me write them down. First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Hmm, I notice that the diagonal elements for P are zero. So P doesn't seem to be a diagonal matrix, which might complicate things.

The matrix for Q is diagonal: first row [1,0,0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-1]. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That makes things easier because measuring Q will give one of these three values.

The question is about measuring Q just after measuring P. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, no. Wait, the question says: the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So the first measurement is P, then Q. So the order is important. So the first measurement is P, and the second is Q.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, measuring P will project the system into an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q on that state.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1. Hmm. So the process is:

1. Measure P, get outcome 0.

2. Then, measure Q, get outcome -1.

So the overall probability is the product of two probabilities, but only under certain conditions. Wait, no. Because once you measure P and get 0, the system is in an eigenstate of P corresponding to 0, and then when you measure Q in that state, you get the probability of measuring -1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by first finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

Wait, let me think again. The state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). I think that's in a three-dimensional space, maybe because the matrices are 3x3. So it
