Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator, Ay. 

Wait, the operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. Oh right, I remember that angular momentum operators for spin-½ particles are represented by 2x2 matrices. The S matrix here has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

So, I think the first step is to figure out what the matrix Ay looks like. Let's compute that. Since c is h/(4π), and S is the given matrix, so Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. 

Wait, S is the matrix:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So when multiplied by c, which is h/(4π), each element becomes c times the corresponding element of S. So Ay would be:

[0, -i*(h/(4π))]
[i*(h/(4π)), 0]

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that for a matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So, let's set that up. The matrix Ay - λI would be:

[-λ, -i*(h/(4π))]
[i*(h/(4π)), -λ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π))]. Let's compute that.

The (1,2) element is -i c, and the (2,1) is i c (c = h/(4π)). So, the product of these two is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c². Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = +1. So (1,2) * (2,1) is (i c)(-i c) which is -(i^2) c². Wait no, wait: (i)(-i) is -i² = -(-1)
