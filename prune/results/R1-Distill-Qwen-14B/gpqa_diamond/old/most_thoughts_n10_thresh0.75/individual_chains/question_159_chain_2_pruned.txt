Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and the comoving distance. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to piece this together.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops significantly. Wait, what does that signify? Oh right, that sounds like the Lyman-alpha forest or some kind of absorption feature. Or wait, maybe it's the Lyman limit? Or perhaps it's the Balmer break? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines blueward of the Lyman-alpha emission line, right? But in this case, the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. Let me recall the wavelengths. The Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm, which is in the far UV. The Balmer break is around 400 nm, which is in the near UV/optical. Wait, but 790 nm is in the near infrared. Hmm, maybe the Balmer break is the key here.

The Balmer break occurs because when a star emits in the near UV, but if the star's spectrum is redshifted, the Balmer break (which is originally around 400 nm) could shift into the optical. If we see the break at a longer wavelength, that would mean the object is at a higher redshift. So, if the peak is at 790 nm, perhaps that's where the break is. So the rest frame wavelength would be about 400 nm (Balmer break) redshifted to 790 nm. So the redshift z would be (790 / 400) - 1. Let's calculate that: 790 /400 is 1.975, so z is about 0.975. So z is approximately 0.975.

Wait, but wait. The peak is at 790 nm. Does that mean the rest wavelength is 790 or that the observed wavelength is 790? Oh, right, the peak's rest frame would be where the break occurs. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, the rest frame would be (observed wavelength)/(1+z). Alternatively, if the rest frame is the Balmer break (400 nm), then 400*(1+z) =790. So 1+z=790/400=1.975, so z=0.975. So z≈1.

So the quasar is at a redshift z≈1. Now, the question is about the comoving distance. Comoving distance is the distance we use in cosmology, which depends on the expansion history of the universe. The parameters given are the Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and flat universe.

Wait, comoving distance is given by the integral from a=0 to a=1 of c/(a^2 H(a)) da, but I think for a=1, it's
