Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs, and I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up under the confocal microscope. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the setup to understand what's going on. So, the experiment involves neural crest cells and a ligand-receptor pair. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which means the vector has two genes under a single promoter but in opposite directions. The ligand is at the 5' end and is fused to mCherry, while the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand's expression is controlled by the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES regulatory element upstream. 

Wait, I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, often used for expression of transgenes. IRES elements are important in bicistronic vectors because they allow the ribosome to terminate translation at the IRES and then switch to the next mRNA. So, in this case, the ligand is downstream of the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after the IRES. 

The vector has stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites. The ligand-mCherry part has a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor-eGFP has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. Oh, right, these are different lox sites, which means that Cre recombinase will only excise one of them. I think loxP is the wild-type site, and lox2272 is a variant that's not cut by wild-type Cre but requires a mutant version. But wait, the Cre used here is from the SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I believe.

So when they create a mouse model that's homozygous for this construct, and then cross it with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre should bind to the lox sites. But because the mice are hemizygous for SOX10-Cre, that means each offspring has one copy. But wait, the construct has two different lox sites, so which one gets cut? LoxP is recognized by wild-type Cre, so the loxP stop cassette in the ligand's region would be excised in the presence of Cre. Similarly, the lox2272 site isn't cut by wild-type Cre, so the stop cassette for the receptor would remain, unless they have a mutant Cre.

Wait, but the parents are crossed such that the offspring (from the homozygous construct and SOX10-Cre hemizygous) would have the construct in their genome. SOX10-Cre is present in the offspring, so the Cre is active where SOX10 is expressed, which is in neural crest derivatives. 

So, when the Cre is expressed, it should recombine the loxP sites. The ligand is first in the vector, so the loxP-stop-loxP would be removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor is after the IRES. The stop cassette for the receptor is lox2272-based, which Cre from SOX10 wouldn't cut because wild-type Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So, the stop remains for the receptor, meaning the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. Oh wait, no, the vector is designed so that the two genes are in opposite directions. So the ligand is in one orientation, the receptor in the other. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two cistrons, each driven by their own promoters or using IRES elements. 

Wait, no, the vector is a single transcription unit. So the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the ligand OR
