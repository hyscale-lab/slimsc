Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, the question is a bit different because it's mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh right, when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider which ones are reacting and in what way.

First, I think I should figure out the moles of each acid and base. Because the neutralization reaction depends on the moles available. Let me jot down the data.

The solutions are:
- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl
- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4
- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is a strong acid too. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, the H+ ions from the acids will react with OH- ions from the base.

But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So I need to account for that. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base, and each formula unit provides two OH- ions. Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻ when dissolved.

So let's compute the moles for each.

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

For HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since it's a monoprotic acid, each mole gives 1 mole of H+.

For H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Since it's diprotic, each mole gives 2 moles H+. So that's 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions, so 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the H+ is 0.28 moles and OH- is 0.2 moles. The reaction between them will produce water. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the limiting reagent here is OH- because it's 0.2 moles, while H+ is 0.28. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

The enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction is based on the moles of H+ that react. Each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases about 57.3 kJ (I think that's the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases). But wait, the value might be given in kcal? Or the options have different units.

Wait, the options have kcal and kJ. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.3 kJ/mol, which is about -13.7 kcal/mol. Wait, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.7 kcal.

So for each mole of H+ that reacts, it releases 57.3 kJ (or about 13.7 kcal) of energy. So since we have 0.2 moles of OH-, which is the limiting reagent, the reaction will involve 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

So the ent
