Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the stability of cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are involved here. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. 

Wait, the compounds in question are the cobalt thiocyanato complexes. The problem gives me the stability constants β1 to β4. So each β corresponds to a different complex, right? Let me think: I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions.

So, Co(II) can form different complexes like [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]^-, and [Co(SCN)4]^2-. Each of these has a different stability constant. Stability constants tell us how stable (or how much) the complex will form.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, the solution is at a certain [SCN^-], which is relatively high. But wait, the stability constants are given, so I need to find the distribution of each complex.

I think the general approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. For each complex, the fraction is (β^something) multiplied by the concentration terms. 

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of a complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / (Σ for each m of βm [SCN]^m + 1). Because the denominator includes all possible complexes plus the free ions.

So, for each n, the fraction fn is (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of βm [SCN]^m) where m=0 would be just 1 (since [SCN]^0 is 1), but wait in the denominator, the term is [Co] times something? No, I think the formula is:

The fraction for each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 βm [SCN]^m + K0), where K0 is the term for free Co^2+? Or maybe the sum includes all possible complexes and the free ion.

Wait, in the overall expression, the sum is over all possible species, so each species contributes its term. The free Co^2+ would have β0 = 1 (I think), and [SCN]^0 is 1. Wait, no, the complexes are formed by Co^2+ and SCN^-.

So the general expression is that the fraction of each species is (βn [SCN-]^n) divided by the sum of all (βm [SCN-]^m) for m from 0 to 4.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The formation of each complex is stepwise, and the overall fraction is based on the cumulative effect. So the fraction f_n for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is (β_n [SCN]^n) / D, where D is the sum of β_m [SCN]^m for m=0 to
