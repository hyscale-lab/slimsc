Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, there's this alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super fast spaceship that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to c, right? The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. Wait, the options are about whether they'll die or how many years they'll live when they get here.

Wait, the question says the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So, the astronaut is 22 now. If the trip takes, say, 70 years from their point of view, then they'd be 92 when they arrive. Which is way under 150, so they'd survive. But if it's longer, maybe they wouldn't. So, the key is calculating the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

The spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, which is a high fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic effects definitely apply. From Earth's frame, the distance is probably something we need to calculate, but wait, the problem says to find the time from the astronaut's perspective. So, I think we need to use time dilation and length contraction.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The proper time (tau) is the time experienced by the traveling astronaut. The Earth-based time (t) would be longer due to time dilation. But since the question is about the astronaut's own lifetime, we need to find the proper time for the journey.

But wait, how do we find the proper time? The proper time is the shortest time between two events (departure and arrival) in the spaceship's frame. So, the astronaut's own time is tau, which is calculated using the Lorentz transformation.

The formula for proper time is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but wait, that's not right. Wait, the formula is tau squared equals t squared minus (v squared/c squared) times x squared. Oh, right, because tau^2 = t^2 - (x^2)/(c^2), but that's in the Earth frame. Alternatively, using the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but
