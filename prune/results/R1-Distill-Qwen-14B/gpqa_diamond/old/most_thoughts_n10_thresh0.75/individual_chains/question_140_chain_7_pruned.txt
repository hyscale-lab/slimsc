Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I remember that water freezes at 273 K, so 277 is just a bit above that. Maybe B is something that's a solid at that temperature or maybe a different compound.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So, X is probably something that can react with a keto acid, maybe a base or something like that. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The mention of a heavier isotope suggests that X has an element with an isotope that's heavier than the common one. So maybe X is an isotope-containing compound.

Wait, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So I need to find out what elements are present in X and their isotopes. Then sum the lightest and heaviest atomic masses.

Let me think about the reactions. X reacts with Y to produce W, G, and B. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm, possible gases with that property. Let's think of H2O, but that has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (assuming H and O)? No, wait, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons if H1) and O which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since O-16 is 8p,8n). So H2O molecule: protons=2+8=10, neutrons= 0*2 +8=8. Not equal. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe another gas. Like CO2? CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if C-12) and O (8 each). So each CO2 molecule has 6+8*2=22 protons, and 6 + 8*2=22 neutrons. So 22 each. That fits. So W is CO2? Or maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: NH3. But NH3 has 7+3*1 for each molecule. Protons: 7+3=10. Neutrons: (7-1) + 3*(1-1) =6. No, that's not equal. Not matching.

Wait, could it be O2? O2 is O-O, each O has 8 protons. So the molecule has 16 protons. Each O has 8 neutrons (O-16). So each molecule has 16 neutrons. So protons=16, neutrons=16. That would fit. So W could be O2. But O2 is a diatomic gas.

Another option: maybe CH4? Protons:6+4=10. Neutrons:6 (if C is 12C) + 4*(0) =6. Not equal.

Wait, maybe another approach. The gas W has protons equal to neutrons. So for a molecule, sum of protons (from all atoms) equals sum of neutrons (from all atoms). So for example, let's say the molecule is H2O. Protons:2 +8=10. Neutrons: (0 from H) +8=8. Not equal. So no.

Maybe another molecule: like CO. C has 6p, O 8p. So molecule: 6+8=14p. Neutrons: 6 (if C-12) +8 (if O-
