Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. So mu = gamma * S_z.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, so I guess that means it's in an eigenstate of S_z. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so when the magnetic field is applied along Z, the spin will precess around Z, right? But when it's turned off, the spin might start to evolve differently. Oh, but then another field is applied along Y. So the spin is now under the influence of a magnetic field in the Y-direction.

I remember that in such cases, the spin state will precess around the new field direction. The energy levels of the spin in a magnetic field are determined by the Zeeman effect. The energy is proportional to the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So the Hamiltonian would probably be something like H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, that would make H proportional to gamma S · B.

Wait, let me think again. The magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma * S_z. Oh wait, no, actually, wait, mu is the magnetic moment vector. So more accurately, mu is mu = gamma * S, since the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin. So each component would be mu_x = gamma * S_x, etc.

Wait, but the initial setup: the magnetic field is along Z. So the Hamiltonian at that time was H_initial = - gamma B S_z. The eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with energies proportional to +gamma B and -gamma B, respectively.

But then the field is turned off, so for a moment, the Hamiltonian must be zero. Then, a new field is turned on along Y, so the new Hamiltonian is H_final = - gamma B S_y. Because the field is along Y now.

Wait, but wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is - mu · B.
