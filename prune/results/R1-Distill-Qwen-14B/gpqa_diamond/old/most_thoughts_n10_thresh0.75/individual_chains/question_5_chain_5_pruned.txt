Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that I'm dealing with a quantum mechanical operator P, which is a vector operator composed of components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The direction in question is an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin or angular momentum components usually have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But wait, here the operator is P. Hmm, I think it's similar to the Pauli matrices. Hmm.

The given components are:

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1), second row (1,0). That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,-i), second row (i,0). That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.

And P_z is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (1,0), second row (0,-1). That's the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

So the operator P is a vector operator, and I need to find its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That direction can be represented as a unit vector (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. So the eigenvalue equation would be P · n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator along direction n is the dot product of P with n. So the operator is P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z (since n is in x-z plane, ny is zero). Because n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

So the operator we're considering is:

P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write out the matrix for this operator. Since each P component is scaled by ħ/2, I can factor that out.

So P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

So the matrix form would be:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you multiply by n_x and n_z respectively, and add them:

n_x σ_x: [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z σ_z: [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]
So sum is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Multiply by ħ/2, so the operator is:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Now, to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to solve (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. So (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] - (ħ/2) I = ħ/2 [ [n_z -1, n_x ], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Wait, no, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So the subtraction gives:

Each diagonal element is (n_z -1) and (-n_z -1), multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

So the equation is (ħ/2) [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ]] |v> = 0.

We can ignore the scaling by (ħ/2) since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple. So the matrix equation becomes:

[[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]] |v> = 0.

So the system of equations is:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

Let me write this as:

(1) (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

(2) n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

We can write these as:

Equation (1): (n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2

Equation (2): n_x v1 = (n_z +1) v2

So from equation (1), v1 = [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 )

From equation (2), v1 = [ (n_z +1 ) v2 ] / n_x

So setting these two expressions equal:

[ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 ) = [ (n_z +1 ) v2 ] / n_x

Assuming v2 is not zero (if v2 is zero, then from equation (1), v1 would also have to be zero, which can't be since that's trivial), we can cancel v2.

So:

- n_x^2 / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1 )

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1 ) = n_z^2 -1

So:

- n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1

Rearranging:

n_z^2 -1 + n_x^2 = 0

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So substituting:

(1 - n_x^2) -1 + n_x^2 = 0 → 0 = 0. So this holds.

So the two equations are consistent.

Now, back to the expressions for v1 and v2.

From equation (2), v1 = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] * v2

Let me choose v2 as a parameter, say v2 = c (some constant), then v1 = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] c.

But since the eigenvector can be scaled, we can set c=1, so v1 = (n_z +1 ) / n_x.

Wait, but we can also write this as the ratio between components.

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( (n_z +1 ), n_x )

Wait, is that right? Let me see.

Wait, because v1 = (n_z +1)/n_x * v2 → so v1 : v2 = (n_z +1) : n_x.

So the vector is proportional to [ (n_z +1), n_x ].

But I need to remember that n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of the spherical coordinates or angles.

Since the direction is in x-z plane, we can define the angle θ as the angle between the direction vector and the z-axis. So n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ. Because in the x-z plane, the unit vector can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But wait, no, the usual convention is that θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So yes, n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since phi is zero (since the direction is in x-z plane, so φ=0 or π?), no, wait, any angle in x-z plane would have φ=0 or π, but our direction is arbitrary in x-z, so φ can be anything. Hmm, but since the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, perhaps we should express the eigenvector in terms of θ and φ. Wait, but the options have different expressions, including theta and phi.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which seems like spherical coordinates for a spin-½ state. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which looks like a spinor representation for a state along some axis. Option D has sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). Hmm.

Wait, the eigenvectors for spin-½ particles
