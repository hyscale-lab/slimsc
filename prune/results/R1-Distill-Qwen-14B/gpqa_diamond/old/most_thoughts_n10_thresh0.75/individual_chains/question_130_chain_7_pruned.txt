Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects using ground-based telescopes. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, redshift has to do with how much the wavelength of light is stretched as it travels through the expanding universe. Right, the formula for redshift (z) is (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength.

Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms. But wait, when it's absorbed by hydrogen in a cloud, the light is absorbed. So the quasar emits this light, and if the cloud is moving away, the wavelength of the absorbed light would be redshifted. But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud such that the absorption can be detected by optical telescopes on the ground.

Wait, optical telescopes observe in wavelengths from about 400 to 700 nm, right? Because that's what the atmosphere transmits (since the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV, which is why space telescopes are useful for UV). So for ground-based optical telescopes, the observed wavelength must be in the visible range.

So the Lyman alpha line is originally at 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 nm. For it to
