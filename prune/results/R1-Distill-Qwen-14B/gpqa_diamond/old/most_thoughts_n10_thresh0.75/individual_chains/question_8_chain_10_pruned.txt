Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question. Let me read through it carefully.

So the setup is about an experiment on white lupine to find genes involved in resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each and double mutants. 

The key thing is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of other genes, right? So if G is a TF, it would activate or repress other genes.

They tested the resistance of the mutants. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. The mutants have varying percentages. Lower percentage means more susceptibility.

The data:
- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild-type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, so I'm trying to figure out what these results mean about the gene interactions.

First, let's make sense of each individual mutant. 

g1 has 75% resistance. So it's less but not completely. That suggests that knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but maybe it's not the only gene involved. 

g2 has 0%, which is the most susceptible. So knocking out G2 completely abolishes resistance. That's a strong effect. 

g3 is 50%, so it's also reducing resistance.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (so both together make them even worse than either alone)
g1g3: 10% (even worse than g3 alone)
g2g3: 0% (again, worse than either g2 or g3)

Wait, so when you have g2 in a double mutant, the resistance is 0%. Let's see:

g1g2: 0
g2g3: 0
g1g2g3 (but data not provided, but perhaps it's not needed)

But wait, in the data, the only double mutants given are g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

So, considering that when g2 is present in a double mutant, the resistance is 0, but when it's not, like in g1g3, the resistance is 10% which is worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So g1g3 is worse than either.

So what does this mean about the relationships between these genes?

In genetics, when the double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways. But when the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that the two genes function in the same pathway. If the phenotype is as severe as the more severe single mutant, that could indicate epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of the double mutant A B is the same as gene A. Like, if a mutation in A completely masks the effect of gene B.

In our case, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 (without G1 and G2) has 0%: same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0 whether G1 is present or not. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1. Because the presence of G1 doesn't help when G2 is knocked out.

Similarly, in g2g3: 0% same as g2. So G2 is epistatic over G3 as well.

What about g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either alone. That suggests they might be in parallel pathways, but not sure yet.

Now, the problem states that one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So the transcription factor would regulate the others.

Let's think about the options.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor. Then, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G2 is epistatic, that makes sense because the double mutants involving G2 have resistance 0. So G2 being epistatic would align with that.

But whether G1 is the TF? Let's see.

If G1 is a TF, and G2 is downstream of G1, then knocking out G1 would reduce the expression of G2. But in our data, g1 has 75% resistance, while g2 is 0. So if G1 is a TF for G2, then in g1, G2 wouldn't be expressed. But that would mean that in g1, the resistance should be like g2, which is 0. But in reality, g1 is 75%, which is higher than g2. So that doesn't fit. So maybe G1 isn't the TF.

Option B: G2 is the TF. Let me think.

If G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are under its regulation. So then, in the wild-type, G2 activates G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, you can't activate G1 and G3, so their functions are lost. But wait, in the double mutants, if both G1 and G3 are non-functional, the resistance drops a lot, which is what is happening.

Wait, looking at the data, g2 (no G2) has 0% resistance. So if G2 is a TF, then knocking it out would mean that all downstream genes (like G1 and G3) aren't expressed. So in that case, the double mutants g1g2 and g3g2 are similar to g2 because G1 and G3 already aren't working.

But wait, if G2 is a TF, then in the single mutant g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in g1g
