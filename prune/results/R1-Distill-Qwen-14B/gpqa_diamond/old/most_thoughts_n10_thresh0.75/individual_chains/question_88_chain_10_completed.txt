Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some immunology processes. Hmm, let's see. I remember that rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, and I think it's a common cause of diarrhea in kids. The question is about tagging inner capsid proteins with GFP and giving them to mice. 

So the setup: they deliver these tagged proteins via oral gavage, which means they're introduced into the stomach. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh wait, because the stomach is acidic, so the GFP might not survive, making the proteins unrecognizable. But some of them made it through the mucus in the intestines and reached the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like Peyer's patches, which are in the small intestine, right?

They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and took the proliferating cells—probably B cells since they’re talking about variable heavy chain genes. Sequencing showed high variability in the variable regions. So what process causes high variability in the variable heavy chains?

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each option. VDJ recombination is during the early stages of B cell development, in the bone marrow. It's when the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to form the heavy chain. So that's when the initial diversity is created. But if they're talking about high variability in the variable regions after the B cells have already been exposed to an antigen, that's probably not VDJ. Because VDJ is more about the initial diversity, not the hypermutation.

Somatic hypermutation happens after the B cell is activated, usually in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This process introduces point mutations, especially in the variable regions of the B cell receptor (BCR) genes, leading to affinity maturation. So this would explain why the cells isolated have a lot of variability in their variable heavy chains.

Class switching is about changing the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), which involves recombination of the heavy chain's constant regions. It doesn't directly affect the variable regions' variability.

Complement activation is part of the immune response, but it's more about the activation of the complement system leading to lysis of pathogens or opsonization. It doesn't directly cause variability in the B cell receptors.

So putting it together: the B cells in the Peyer's patches are likely undergoing an immune response to the rotavirus proteins. Since the GFP-tagged proteins were taken up, the B cells would recognize them. In the germinal centers, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, increasing the diversity of their receptors. That explains the high variability seen in the variable heavy chain sequences after they're isolated.

So the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are exposed to stomach acid and intestinal mucus, with some reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are isolated, and the proliferating cell population is sequenced, showing high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. The task is to identify the process responsible for this variability.

To analyze the options:

- **VDJ recombination (D):** This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the heavy chain. While it generates initial diversity, it does not account for the observed variability in the variable regions after antigen exposure.

- **Class switching recombination (C):** This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) by altering the constant region of the heavy chain. It does not directly affect the variability of the variable regions.

- **Complement activation (B):** This is part of the immune response that leads to pathogen lysis or opsonization. It does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chains.

- **Somatic hypermutation (A):** This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response after antigen exposure. It introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptor genes, leading to increased diversity and affinity maturation. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chains of the proliferating B cells.

Given that the B cells in the Peyer's patches are likely undergoing an immune response to the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins, the high variability in the variable heavy chains is best explained by somatic hypermutation.
