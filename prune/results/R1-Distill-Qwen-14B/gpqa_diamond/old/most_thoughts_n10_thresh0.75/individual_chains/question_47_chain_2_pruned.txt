Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. They've given some spectroscopic data, so I'll have to analyze that.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea about the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that: (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation, which could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Common structures might have a benzene ring (which is three degrees), a carbonyl group (another one), and maybe an amine or something else.

Now, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are typically N-H stretches. But wait, 3420 is usually a strong, broad peak for either O-H (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or N-H (like in an amine or amide). But the 3325 cm-1 suggests more of an N-H stretch, maybe in an amide. Because in primary amines, the N-H stretch is around 3300-3500, but if it's a secondary amine, it's a bit lower. Alternatively, if there's a carbonyl, perhaps an amide group. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. Since the molecular formula has an amide or something with an amide linkage, the 1720 might be an amide I band (amide carbonyl). Or maybe an ester.

Wait, wait, let me think. Amide I bands are usually around 1640-1680 cm-1, while esters and ketones are higher, around 1700-1750. So the 1720 here is more likely an ester or maybe a ketone. Hmm. Because if it's an amide, the carbonyl would be lower. So maybe the compound has an ester group.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. The benzamide part has a CONH2 group, which would have an amide I around 1650. But the IR here shows 1720, which doesn't fit. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide has a HCONR2 group. The carbonyl in formamides is around 1680-1720. So 1720 cm-1 could fit. But let's see the structure. The formamide would have a formyl group (HCO-) attached to the phenyl. The ethoxy is at the para position.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Propionate is a CH2CH2COO- group. So structure would be O=C(O-)CH2CH2- attached to the benzene ring. But the amino group is at position 4. Wait, but in propionate, it's an ester maybe? No, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph? Or perhaps the propionate is an ester. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count: phenyl (C6) plus propionate (3 carbons) and maybe an amine. Let's see: C6 (Ph) + 3 (from propionate) + N and O2. So the structure would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, it's O=C(O-)CH2CH2CH2NHPh? No, wait, perhaps it's PhNH-CH2CH2COOH? Hmm, but the formula would have more oxygen? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Let me think again.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the structure is O=C(OEt)NHPh. Wait, no, 4-aminobenzoate would be benzene with a NH2 group and a COOEt group at para positions. So the ester would be ethyl.

Wait, but the molecular formula: 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2. As an ethyl ester, it would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5? So C9H12NO2. But the formula given is C9H11NO2. So that's one more hydrogen short. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute the formula.

Benzoate ethyl ester: benzene ring (6 C), COOEt (which is O=C-O-C2H5). So the benzoate would be C7H5O2. Then ethyl ester adds 2 carbons, but wait, 4-aminobenzoate would be
