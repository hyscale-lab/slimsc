Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read through it again.

The question says that there's this small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude sample looks right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is expected. Also, coupling is ruled out because the pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks with same mass and same intensity. Both have the same mass spec, which matches the expected molecule.

Hmm, so what's going on here. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor in mass spec would have a higher mass, like the molecular ion would be M+ instead of the target M. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected. So maybe A isn't the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images and wouldn't be separated by normal HPLC because the column can't tell them apart. Unless it's a chiral column, but the question doesn't mention that. Also, in 1H NMR, enantiomers would have the same spectrum since they're mirror images. So the NMR would look the same, no extra peaks. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure about this. Double coupling refers to a situation where a proton couples with two different neighboring protons. But wait, the question says the NMR peaks are from the same alpha-proton. If it's a coupling issue, maybe like in a diastereomer? But the peaks are same shift and integral, so maybe not. Also, the coupling pattern would probably show splitting, but the question rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation. So maybe C isn't right.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would show up as separate peaks on HPLC. But in the NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. How?

Wait, if it's a diastereomer, the alpha protons might be in slightly different environments. But in the NMR, if each diastereomer is present, each would have their own alpha proton signals. But the integral of each would add up to 1H each. Wait, the question says together they integrate to 1H. So if each is 1H, but the total is 1H? That doesn't add up. Or maybe the two diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment so they give the same shift. But why two peaks?

Wait, another thought. If the compound has more than one stereocenter, and the synthesis didn't fully control the stereochemistry, you could get a mixture of diastereomers. Each diastereomer would have different NMR shifts. But in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of epimerization, where a chiral center is formed but can flip. Wait, but in the NMR, that would cause a splitting if it's a dynamic process, but in this case, the two peaks are observed. But if the molecule is a diastereomer mixture, each would have different shifts. But the problem says the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe that's not matching.

Wait, but the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So each peak is from the same proton in different environments? But that's confusing. Unless, I'm missing something.

Let me think about the LC-MS. The two peaks have the same mass, so same molecular weight. So same molecular formula, which suggests they are either constitutional isomers (unlikely if the structure is correct), or stereoisomers.

In the case of diastereomers, the mass would be same, so the same m/z in LC-MS. So if the mixture has diastereomers, the LC would separate them into two peaks. That fits with the two LC-MS peaks.

Now, the NMR: two peaks for the same alpha proton. How? Maybe each diastereomer has that proton in a slightly different environment, causing a slight shift, but the shifts are similar.

But wait, if the two diastereomers are present, each would have their own set of protons. Each would give a peak for the alpha proton, but in the NMR, you would see two separate peaks. Since both are present, the integral of each would be about half, but the question says together they integrate to 1H, suggesting each contributes 0.5H? No, because each alpha proton is 1H, but in a diastereomer, you have another 1H. But that would make the total 2H, which contradicts the integral.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, each integrating to 0.5H. Because the compound is a 50:50 mix of two diastereomers. So each has the same alpha proton, but in a slightly different environment, leading to two peaks. So the integral for each would be 0.5H, adding up to 1H. That matches the question's statement.

So for LC-MS, two peaks because two diastereomers. NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because each diastereomer contributes a peak. So the answer would be D) mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but why not option A? Because option A would be a different molecular ion. The mass spec in question shows same mass, so A is not it.

So putting it together, the most likely explanation is diastereomers in the mixture.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

**Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
If the compound were contaminated with a precursor, the mass spectrum would show a different molecular ion (M+), as a precursor typically has a higher mass. However, the question specifies that both peaks in the LC-MS have the same mass as the expected molecule. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

**Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and would not be separated by standard HPLC unless a chiral column is used. The question does not mention the use of a chiral column, so it is unlikely that enantiomers are responsible for the two LC-MS peaks. Additionally, enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images, so this does not explain the two distinct NMR peaks. Thus, this option is also unlikely.

**Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
Double coupling refers to a situation where a proton couples with two different neighboring protons. However, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate NMR peaks. Furthermore, double coupling would not explain the presence of two distinct LC-MS peaks with the same mass. Therefore, this option is not a plausible explanation.

**Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and have different physical properties, such as NMR shifts. If the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, each diastereomer would contribute its own set of NMR peaks. The two LC-MS peaks with the same mass are consistent with diastereoisomers, as they have the same molecular formula. In the NMR spectrum, the two peaks for the same alpha-proton could arise because the alpha-proton exists in slightly different environments in the two diastereomers, leading to similar but distinct chemical shifts. The integrals of the two peaks adding up to 1H suggest a 50:50 mixture, where each diastereomer contributes 0.5H to the integral. This explanation aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
