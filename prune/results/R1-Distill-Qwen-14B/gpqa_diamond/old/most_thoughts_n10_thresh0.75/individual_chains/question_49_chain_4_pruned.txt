Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond, right? Oh wait, the question says that the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. I think that's correct because in these rearrangements, a group moves along with a shift in the pi system.

The problem has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out what each product is. Then, I have to match each product with the options given. Let me take them one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A. Hmm, okay. So what's 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine look like? It's a molecule where the amine is on carbon 1, and there are two methoxy groups also on carbon 1. Maybe it's something like OMe-O-C-C-NH2? Wait, the structure might be more like H2N-C(OCH3)2, where the central carbon is attached to two OMe groups and the amine.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, right? Because but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3, but wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, but but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

But-3-en-2-ol: The formula is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. The structure would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3, but that can't be because the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, the structure is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3? No, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's 2-penten-1-ol? No, wait. The correct structure for but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, with the double bond starting at carbon 3. Hmm, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's five carbons. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol has four carbons with the double bond between C3 and C4? But but only has four carbons, so the double bond would be between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Or is it CH2=CH-CH
