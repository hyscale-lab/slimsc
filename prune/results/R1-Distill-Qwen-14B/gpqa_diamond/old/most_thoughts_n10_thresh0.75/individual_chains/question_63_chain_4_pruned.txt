Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule's energy states and the momentum of a photon that causes a transition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I remember that in quantum models, different states are associated with different energy levels. The molecule has elements X and Y, with masses given in amu and a bond length in angstroms. The angular frequency is provided too.

Wait, the model mentioned is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that this model combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. But when the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, I should figure out whether it's a change in rotation, vibration, or both.

In the rigid rotor model, energy levels are quantized and given by something like (ħ² l(l+1)) / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as well, with the harmonic oscillator model, which has energy levels (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer. But wait, this is the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe it's more like a rotation-vibration coupling, but maybe the problem simplifies it to treating the transitions separately.

Wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That probably means the lowest energy transition from the current state—so the photon should cause the smallest possible increase in energy. That would imply the transition is either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state, whichever requires less energy.

But wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state would be the lowest energy state. For a diatomic, the fundamental state is the state with the lowest possible vibrational and rotational energy. So, n=0 for vibration and l=0 for rotation, I think. Because the rotation and vibration are separate, the overall energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but when the molecule absorbs a photon, the photon's energy must match the energy difference between two states. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So, the photon's frequency should match the lowest possible energy difference.

What's the order of energies for these states? Well, the vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the spacing between them is ħω. For the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (n + 1/2)ħω, so the spacing between n and n+1 is ħω. But the rotational energy levels have a spacing of (ħ² (l+1)(l+2)) / (2I) - (similar for l and l+1). So, the energy difference between rotational levels increases with higher l.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest state. So, it's n=0 and l=0. To get the next lowest state, perhaps the molecule could go to a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (l=1). I need to calculate which transition requires less energy.

Let me compute the energy required for each possible transition.

First, the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1. The energy difference is ħω (since (1 + 1/2) ħω - (0 + 1/2) ħω = ħω), right?

Then, the rotational transition from l=0 to l=1. The energy for rotation is given by E_rot = (ħ² l(l+1)) / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For l=0, E_rot =0. For l=1, E_rot = (ħ² * 1*2)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So, the energy difference for the rotational transition is ħ²/(I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So, which one is smaller: ħω or ħ²/(I)?

The photon's energy must match the energy difference. But since the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon, I need to relate that to the energy. Because the photon's energy is E = p c, where p is the momentum. Also, E_photon = ΔE, the energy difference.

So, first I'll compute both ΔE values and see which is smaller.

Let me calculate each ΔE.

Compute ΔE_vibr = ħω.

Compute ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Which is smaller depends on the values. Let's compute I first.

I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

Given the masses: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu.

20 + 2 is 22. 20*2=40, so μ = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = (20/11) * 1.66e-27 kg.

Let me compute that numerically. 20/11 ≈ 1.818. Multiply by 1.66e-27 kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg. Approximately 3e-27 kg.

Wait, let me be precise: 20/11 is about 1.81818, and 1.81818 * 1.6605390666e-27 kg (since 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg) equals:

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (1.818 * 1.6605) e-27.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 2.999, so about 3e-27 kg.

So I = μ r².

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

r squared is (2e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = μ r² = (3e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²) = 12e-47 kg m².

Wait, let me compute that again. 3e-27 *4e-20 = 12e-47.

So I = 1.2e-46 kg m²? Wait, 3e-27 *4e-20 = 12e-47, which is 1.2e-46.

Yes.

Now, compute ΔE_rot = ħ^2/(I) .

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately: (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait, no. Wait, the units for
