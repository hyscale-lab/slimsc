Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that means there's an ester functional group present. The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals: two for aromatic-H, two for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. The options are four different chemical formulas.

Hmm, first, I should probably visualize the structure. The aromatic ring is six-membered, like benzene, but it's di-substituted, meaning two substituents attached. Since the IR shows an ester, one of the substituents is likely an ester group. But wait, esters have carbonyl groups, so maybe the other substituent is something else. Or maybe both substituents are related to the ester?

Wait, esters are usually something like R-O-C-O-R', so the structure might have an ester group attached. So on the benzene ring, we have two substituents. One could be an ester, like maybe a methyl ester or something. The other substituent? Could it be a vinyl group or a methyl group?

Looking at the NMR data: six signals, which probably correspond to different sets of protons in different environments.

So, aromatic-H: two signals. That suggests the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be para, meta, or ortho. If it's para, the aromatic protons would have two sets, each with two protons, right? Because the ring is symmetric. So maybe the substituents are para to each other. That would explain two signals for aromatic protons.

Next, the vinyl-H: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, so maybe we have a substituent that's a vinyl group, like an ethenyl group. Wait, but vinyl groups typically have two protons that are adjacent. Let me think. If the substituent is an ester, like maybe an ester with a vinyl chain attached? Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -OCH2CH2O- or something else, but that might not fit.

Wait, the presence of a doublet and a doublet of quartets for vinyl protons. Hmm. Let me consider a structure where the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring. But wait, if the substituent is an ester, maybe the ester is part of a larger group. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So that's probably two different methyl groups. Maybe one methyl is part of an ester (like OMe in an ester group), and another methyl is somewhere else.

Wait, let's think of the structure: benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent could be a methyl ester, like OMe, and the other substituent could be a vinyl group attached to another oxygen. Or maybe the other substituent is a group containing a methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the ester functional group. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring. But wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups, so maybe there are two methyl groups in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. Let me think about the vinyl group. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would have protons that are next to each other. So for a vinyl group, the protons are adjacent and split each other. So in the NMR, each of these protons would be a doublet. But in the question, we have two vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the vinyl group is part of a larger substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a simple vinyl group but something like an allyl group or part of a ring. Hmm, but the question says di-substituted, so only two substituents on the benzene.

Wait, maybe one substituent is an ester group, such as OCO-R, where R is a group with methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group. But no, methoxy is an ether, not an ester. Wait, ester is like R-O-CO-R', so maybe one substituent is a OCO- group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, like OMe-CO-O-, but that might be too long.

Wait, maybe
