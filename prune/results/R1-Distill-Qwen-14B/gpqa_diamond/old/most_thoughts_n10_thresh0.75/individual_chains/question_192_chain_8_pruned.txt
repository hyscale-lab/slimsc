Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The setup is a bit tricky. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, charges redistribute in certain ways. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think the conductor will have induced charges. 

Wait, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge opposite to the placed charge. So, the inner surface would have -q. But because the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance it out. 

So, the total charge on the conductor's outer surface is +q. Now, point P is outside the conductor, so when calculating the electric field there, I can treat the conductor's charge as if it were concentrated at the center, right? Because for points outside a spherical conductor, the field behaves as if all the charge is at the center. 

But wait, wait. The conductor's charge is on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius R. The point P is outside, so all that +q on the outer surface contributes to the field as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor. But what about the charge inside the cavity?

Wait, no. Because the charge inside the cavity is enclosed within the conductor. So, the field inside the conductor due to the cavity's charge is zero because it's a conductor. Wait, no, that's not right. The cavity is inside the conductor, but the conductor is a shell. The charge +q is inside the cavity, so the inner surface of the conductor has -q, and the outer surface has +q
