Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I've heard about this reaction before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The problem has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I'll tackle them one at a time.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, let me visualize this structure. The benzene ring is attached to a methylene group (CH₂), which is connected to an oxygen (oxy) group. Then, the other end of the oxygen is attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me write that out: the structure is benzene-O-CH₂-C(CH₂CH₂CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH2 with a double bond starting at position 2. So, it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH2- but with a methyl substituent on carbon 3. Wait, but where's the substituent? The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group would be CH₂=C(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait, but butenyl is four carbons. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 2 and 3. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So it's CH₂-CH2-CH2-CH2, but double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, that's but-2-enyl. Oh wait, the substituent is on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH₂-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait. Let me think again. The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group: the substituent is on the third carbon of butenyl. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-R. Wait, but wait,
