Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄, each in degrees: 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees. The incident electrons are at 50 MeV, but the target is a nuclear target. Oh, right, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, so I guess I'll only consider these five.

Wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ), and when θ is zero (along the incident direction), the expression simplifies somehow.

Oh right, there's this formula for the scattering amplitude when the scattering angle θ is zero. I think it's related to the sum of the phase shifts. Let me recall. The imaginary part might involve a sum over all the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.

Wait, the general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) * e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) * ... Hmm, no, wait. Wait, I think the imaginary part of f(0) is given by the sum of (2l + 1) multiplied by sin(δ_l), all divided by k.

Wait, more
