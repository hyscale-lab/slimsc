Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, stability constants... Right, stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of a complex ion. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So, each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think about the complexes here.

The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n is the number of SCN- attached. The stability constants βn would be for the complex with n thiocyanate ions. So, β1 is for the monomeric complex, β2 for the one with two SCN-, and so on.

The question specifically asks about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that the color of the complex can vary depending on the number of SCN- ligands attached. For example, [Co(SCN)6]^3- is usually a different color than others, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the blue ones are probably the [Co(SCN)4]^2- or [Co(SCN)2]^0? No, wait, I think the blue might be the [Co(SCN)4]^2- complex. Or maybe another. Well, the problem specifies "dithiocyanato", which means two SCN- ions. So the complex in question is [Co(SCN)2]^2+ (since Co is +2, each SCN- is -1, so 2*(−1) = -2, so overall charge would be 0? Wait, no: wait, Co is +2, 2 SCN- would make the complex [Co(SCN)2]^0, a neutral species. Hmm, but what about other possibilities.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato", which means two SCN- groups. So the complex is [Co(SCN)2]^2+? Wait, let me think: if Co^2+ is the ion, and each SCN- is -1, then two SCN- would be -2. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)2]^0, which is a neutral species. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact charge; maybe I should just go with the given β values.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's for n=1 to n=4? Or maybe n=1 to n=4, but wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than some of the others. So, for each complex, the β increases up to a point and then maybe decreases? Or perhaps it's
