Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what compound E is in this reaction scheme. Let me go through each step and the hints to piece it together.

First, the problem gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with E. Let me write down each step.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided.

Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are usually used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So if A reacts with a ylide to form an alkene, that suggests A is a carbonyl compound, either an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the product from the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, the substituents are propan-2-ylidene? Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= group? Maybe. So the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituted double bond.

Wait, but the product of the Wittig is an alkene. So then, the starting material A must be a ketone or aldehyde. Since the product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents, perhaps A has a cyclopentane ring with a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Because when A reacts with HCN, it forms B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups, so if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, B would be a primary cyanohydrin.

Let me think: When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a secondary cyanohydrin (like adding HCN to cyclohexanone would give cyclohexane with a hydroxyl and cyanide group adjacent). So if A is a cyclic ketone, B would be a cyclo compound with an alcohol and nitrile group.

Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So B likely has a nitrile group because under hydrogenation, nitriles can be reduced. Wait, H2 with Pd usually reduces nitriles to amines, but sometimes other conditions are needed. Alternatively, if B has a carbonyl group (from the cyanohydrin) that gets reduced.

Wait, cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile. So
