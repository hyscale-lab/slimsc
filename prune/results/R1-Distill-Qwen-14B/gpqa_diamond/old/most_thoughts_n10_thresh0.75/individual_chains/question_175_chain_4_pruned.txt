Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, let me think.

The question says it's a spheroid shape with the symmetry along the z-axis. Since it's oscillating, it radiates, and the wavelength is λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A. The question is asking what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what form f takes.

I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle has a specific dependence on the angle θ. Oh right! The radiation pattern for a dipole is sin²θ. So the power as a function of θ is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the charge distribution is oscillating. So it's probably an oscillating dipole? Because a dipole oscillating would radiate. So the form of f, which is the power per unit solid angle, should be proportional to sin²θ, maybe multiplied by some function of λ.

But the options given don't have sinθ terms. Oh, because the function f is a function of λ and θ. Wait, the options are giving possible forms for f. So the function f must depend on λ and θ, but in the options, the forms are only given as λ terms, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees." So I think I need to find the value of f at θ=30°, divided by the maximum power A. So f(θ) is the power per solid angle at that angle, and A is the maximum. So the fraction is f(θ)/A.

Wait, but when θ is 0, the power would be zero because sin(0)=0. And when θ is 90 degrees, sin²(90)=1, so maximum. So the maximum power occurs at θ=90°, which is the direction perpendicular to the dipole axis.

So the maximum value of f is at θ=90°, which would be f_max = A. So when θ=30°, what is the value of f?

f(30) = sin²(30) * f_max = (1/2)^2 * A = (1/4) A.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If the maximum power is A, which occurs at θ=90°, then the fraction at θ=30° is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum. Wait, no: sin^2(30) is (1/2)^2=1/4. So the fraction is 1/4 times A? Or is the function f such that the integral over all solid angles gives the total radiated power?

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is f(θ), so the total power A would be the integral of f(θ) over the entire solid angle.

So A = ∫ f(θ) sinθ dθ dφ. Since f is a function of θ only,
