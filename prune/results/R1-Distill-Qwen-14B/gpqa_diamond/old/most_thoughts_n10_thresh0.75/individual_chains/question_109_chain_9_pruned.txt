Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, the initial state is 1S0, which I remember is written in the (2S+1)L(J) notation. Let me break that down: 1S0 would mean 2S+1 is 1, so S is 0. L is S, so L is 0 (since it's S state), and J is 0. So the initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.

Now, the problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin. Oh, I think isospin is a kind of abstract quantum number, but for two nucleons (like protons and neutrons), the isospin can be either 0 or 1. Because, I remember that when two identical particles combine, their isospin needs to follow certain rules. So for two nucleons, if they are in a singlet state (T=0), it's antisymmetric, and triplet (T=1) is symmetric.

But wait, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So the isospin after emission must be 0. Now, the Pauli equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Hmm, so T is equal to the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum plus 1, modulo 2. Let me think about that. So, if T is 0, then 0 â‰¡ S + L +1 mod 2. So that means S + L must be 1 mod 2, which is S + L = odd. So S and L can't both be even or both be odd, but one must be even and the other odd.

Wait, let me clarify: S is the spin of the NN system, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So after emitting the particle X, the NN state will have certain quantum numbers. The initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.

So when the particle X is emitted, the new state of the NN must have certain quantum numbers. The problem is asking which of the partial waves is not permitted, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

The options are different transitions. Each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a new state plus a particle. The particle is denoted by p, s, f, etc. Wait, I think p, s, d, f correspond to orbital angular momentum l=1, 0, 2, 3, etc. So in the terms like 7D1, the D is L=2, since L is denoted by letters D=2, S=0, P=1, F=3, etc.

So each option describes
