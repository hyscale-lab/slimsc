Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, blocking some of the star's light. Occultation, on the other hand, is when the planet moves behind the star, becoming hidden from view because the star outshines it. For both these events to occur, the planet's orbit must be aligned such that it passes both in front and behind the star relative to us.

The problem states that both planets are in the same system, share the same orbital plane, and have circular orbits. The first planet has a radius of Earth's radius (let's say R_earth), an orbital period of 3 days, and a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun (so R_star = 1.5 R_sun).

Wait, what's the impact parameter? Oh right, that's the distance of closest approach of the planet's path relative to the star's center, measured in units of the star's radius. So a transit happens when the impact parameter is less than the planet's size plus the star's size â€“ no, wait, actually, the impact parameter is the distance from the center of the star to the closest point of the planet's path. So if the impact parameter is smaller than the star's radius, the planet will transit. Wait, no. Wait, no, the impact parameter is the distance from the star's center to the planet's path's closest approach. So if that's less than the sum of the star and planet radii? Or wait, no, because the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's. So for a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star's disk. So the condition is that the impact parameter (b) must be less than or equal to (R_star + R_planet)/R_star? Wait, no, because transit occurs when the planet's path crosses the star's disk. So the impact parameter is the perpendicular distance from the line of sight to the star's center. If that distance is less than the sum of the planet's radius and the star's radius, then a transit occurs. Wait, no, the impact parameter is in the same units as the star's radius. So for a planet to transit, the impact parameter must be less than the star's radius plus the planet's radius, but since the planet is much smaller, it's approximately the star's radius. Wait, but the impact parameter is given as 0.2. So that's 0.2 times the star's radius.

Wait, let me think again. The impact parameter (b) is the distance from the center of the star to the closest point of the planet's path, measured perpendicular to the observer's line of sight. For a transit to happen, the planet must pass in front of the star. So the planet's path's closest approach (b) must be less than the star's radius. Because if b is less than R_star, the planet's disc will overlap with the star's disc.

Wait, but the star is much bigger than the planet. So, yeah, if
