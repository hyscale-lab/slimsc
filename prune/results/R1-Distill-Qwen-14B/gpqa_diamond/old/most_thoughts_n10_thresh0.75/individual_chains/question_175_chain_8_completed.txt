Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can radiate energy, and this is related to something called the dipole radiation. 

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, the setup is symmetric around z, which probably means the radiation pattern depends on the angle theta from the z-axis. 

The problem mentions the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. The maximum power is A. We need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and the possible form of f.

Wait, in dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle. I remember that the radiation pattern for a dipole is sin^2(theta), which means the power is maximum when theta is 90 degrees, and zero at the poles (theta=0 and 180). But wait, wait, wait. No, actually, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the intensity is maximum at theta=90 degrees (perpendicular to the axis). 

But the question says, what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at theta=30 degrees. So I need to find the ratio of the power at theta=30 to the maximum power A.

Since A is the maximum, which occurs at theta=90 degrees, the fraction would be [f(lambda,30)] / [f(lambda,90)].

If f is proportional to sin^2(theta), then at theta=30, f would be sin^2(30) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the fraction would be (1/4)/(1) = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait, what about the dependence on lambda? The function f is given as a function of lambda and theta. The options include different dependencies like lambda^-3, lambda^-4, etc. 

In dipole radiation, the power is proportional to the square of the acceleration, and inversely proportional to the fifth power of the distance, but in the far field, the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to 1/(r^2), but in this problem, it's the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity I think.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity. For dipole radiation, the intensity is given by I = ( (μ_0 p^2 ω^4 )/(12π c^3) ) * sin^2(theta) * (1/(4π)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Let me think. The formula for the average power radiated by a dipole is P = ( ( p^2 ω^4 )/( 12 π ε_0 c^3 )) * something, but the intensity I is P/(4π), because it's spread over a sphere. 

Wait, the actual formula for intensity (which is power per unit area) in dipole radiation is proportional to sin^2(theta), as I thought. So the maximum intensity is when sin(theta)=1, so theta=90 degrees. The fraction at any other angle would be sin^2(theta) divided by the maximum, which is sin^2(theta) for theta=90, so sin^2(theta) when theta is that angle. 

So in this case, at theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin^2(theta)=0.25. So the fraction is 1/4. 

So the first part of the answer is 1/4. 

Now, looking at the options, the fractions are 1/2 (A), 1/4 (B and C), 3/4 (D). So the possible answers are B or C. 

The other part of the question is about the form of f, the function of lambda and theta. The options have different dependencies on lambda. So I need to figure out how f depends on lambda.

The problem says the charge distribution oscillates, so it's an oscillating dipole. The radiation from an oscillating dipole depends on the frequency, which relates to the wavelength. The power radiated (intensity) in dipole radiation also depends on the frequency. Let me recall the formula.

The average power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( ( (e^2 a^2 ω^4 )/( 6 π ε_0 c^3 )) ). But the intensity is the power per unit solid angle, so I think the intensity is proportional to ω^4. 

Wait, wait. The formula for the intensity (which is P/(4π r^2)) in dipole radiation is ( ( (μ_0 p_0^2 ω^4 )/( 12 π c^3 )) ) * sin^2(theta). So the intensity is proportional to ω^4. But since lambda is related to ω via c = lambda * f, and ω = 2 pi f, so omega is 2 pi c/(lambda).

So substituting omega into the intensity expression: intensity ~ ( (1/lambda)^4 ), because omega^4 is (1/lambda^4) because omega is proportional to 1/lambda. 

So f is proportional to 1/lambda^4, multiplied by sin^2(theta). But the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f would be proportional to (1/lambda^4) * sin^2(theta). 

Looking at the options, option C has f proportional to lambda^-4, and the fraction is 1/4. So option C is fraction 1/4 and f ~ lambda^-4. 

Other options: option B has f ~ lambda^-3. So that's not correct. So the correct answer would be option C. 

So the fraction is 1/4, function f is proportional to lambda^-4. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radiation from an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), depends on the wavelength \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis. The maximum power radiated is \( A \), and we need to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern**:  
   For dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \). The maximum power occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength**:  
   The intensity (power per unit solid angle) in dipole radiation is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. Since \( \omega = 2\pi f \) and \( c = \lambda f \), we have \( \omega \propto 1/\lambda \). Therefore, the intensity is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). This means the function \( f \) scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \).

3. **Matching the Options**:  
   - Option A: Fraction \( 1/2 \), \( f \propto \lambda^{-4} \). Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).  
   - Option B: Fraction \( 1/4 \), \( f \propto \lambda^{-3} \). Incorrect, as \( f \propto \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).  
   - Option C: Fraction \( 1/4 \), \( f \propto \lambda^{-4} \). Correct, as both the fraction and the dependence on \(\lambda\) match the analysis.  
   - Option D: Fraction \( 3/4 \), \( f \propto \lambda^{-6} \). Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), and \( f \propto \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

### Final Answer:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the function \( f \) scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \). Thus, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
