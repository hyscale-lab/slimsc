Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

So, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total weight is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. Heating salts often leads to decomposition, especially when there's no air, so maybe they're losing some components, like water or something else.

After heating, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes. Let's see what each tube does.

Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water or maybe other moisture. So when a gas passes through it and the weight increases by 3.60 grams, that suggests that the gas must have had some water vapor. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would react with water, right? The formula for that reaction is Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·8H2O or something like that. So the increase in weight is the water that's been absorbed.

Wait, but wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so it's a desiccant. When it absorbs water, it gains mass. So the 3.60 grams increase is the mass of water vapor that was in the gas mixture. So that's 3.60 grams of H2O.

Moving on to tube 2, which has a Ca(OH)2 solution. Wait, but the weight didn't change. So what does Ca(OH)2 solution do? It reacts with acidic gases, like CO2. So if no change happened, that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gases. Because if there was CO2, it would have reacted with Ca(OH)2, causing a precipitate, and maybe the tube would have increased in mass. Since the weight didn't change, perhaps there's no CO2 in the gas.

Then tube 3 is red-hot copper. The weight increases by 0.80 grams, and CuO is formed. Red-hot copper in the presence of certain gases can react. For example, if there's CO, it would react with Cu to form CuO. The reaction is 2Cu + CO → 2Cu + CO2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, when CO is passed over hot copper, the reaction is 2Cu + CO → 2Cu + CO2? No, that doesn't seem right. Or wait, maybe the reaction is CO reacting with Cu (in a reduction or oxidation sense). Alternatively, perhaps the CO is oxidized. Let me get this right. 

Copper is red-hot, so in the presence of CO, the reaction is: 2Cu + CO → 2Cu + CO2? No, that can't be right because that's an equation but not correct. Wait, I think the correct reaction is 2Cu + CO → 2Cu + CO2. Or maybe another way. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Another thought
