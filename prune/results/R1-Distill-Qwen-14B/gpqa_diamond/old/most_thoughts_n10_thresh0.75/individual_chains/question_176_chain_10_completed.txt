Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but usually quantum states are supposed to be normalized, right? Oh, wait, maybe I'm supposed to normalize it first. Let me check. The state vector is given as a column vector with components (-1, 2, 1). Oh, I should probably compute its norm and then normalize it.

So, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector is ( (-1)/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 )^T. Let me write that down: ψ = [ -1/√6; 2/√6; 1/√6 ].

Next, the operators P and Q are given. I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for these operators because when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

First, let's look at operator Q. Its matrix is diagonal: [1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1]. Oh, that's easy. The eigenvalues of Q are the diagonal elements, so 1, 0, and -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors because it's diagonal. So, for eigenvalue 0, the eigenvectors are any vector in the second component. Wait, no, because Q acting on [0,1,0]^T would be [0;0;0], so that's the eigenvector for 0. So the eigenspace for Q=0 is the one-dimensional space spanned by (0,1,0)^T.

Now, operator P. Its matrix is:
Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Hmm, that's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable. I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me denote this matrix as P.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:
[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Calculating the determinant: expanding along the first row.

det = -λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * something.

First minor: determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2). So first term is -λ*(λ² - 1/2).

Second minor: determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2. So the second term is -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/2.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2.

Expanding: -λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

Set this equal to zero: -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² +1 )=0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ= -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but since the matrix is 3x3, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, I think I forgot about the third element in the first row. Wait, no, the determinant expansion for 3x3 is a bit more involved. Maybe I should try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P has a certain structure. Let me see. The matrix P looks like it's symmetric and maybe has some pattern. Let me try to find eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Looking at the matrix P:

It's a 3x3 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/√2 on the off-diagonal in a certain pattern. Hmm. Maybe it's a permutation matrix multiplied by 1/√2.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. Let me see: the trace of P is 0 (since all diagonal entries are zero), and the sum of eigenvalues should be zero. So if eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0, that would add up to zero, which matches. So yes, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For P=1:

We solve (P - I) v =0. So the matrix becomes:

[-1, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -1]

Let me write the equations:

- v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2.

From second equation: (1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0.

Substituting v1:

(1/√2)(1/√2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = (1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = (-1/2) v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2) v3 = (1/2) v2 → v3= (1/2)/(1/√2) v2 = (√2/2) v2.

So, v1 = (1/√2) v2, v3= (√2/2) v2.

Let v2 = 1, then v1=1/√2, v3= √2/2 = 1/√2. So the eigenvector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T.

Wait, let me check:

Does this vector satisfy P v = v?

P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

v is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2].

So Pv is:

Row1: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(1/√2) ) = 1/√2.

Row2: (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*1 + (1/√2)(1/√2) ) = (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) = 1.

Row3: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)(1) + 0*(1/√2) ) = 1/√2.

Which equals v, so yes, that's correct. So for P=1, the eigenvector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T.

Similarly, for P=-1: (P + I) v =0.

Matrix P + I is [[1, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 1, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 1]].

Equations:

v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1= - (1/√2) v2.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0.

Substituting v1:

(1/√2)(-1/√2 v2 ) + v2 + (1/√2) v3 = (-1/2) v2 + v2 + (1/√2) v3 = (1/2) v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2) v3 = (-1/2) v2 → v3= (-1/2)/(1/√2) v2 = (-√2/2) v2.

So v1= -1/√2 v2, v3= -√2/2 v2.

Take v2=1 → v1= -1/√2, v3= -√2/2.

So the eigenvector is [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T.

Wait, checking:

Pv would be:

Row1: 0*(-1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(-1/√2) ) = 1/√2.

Row2: (1/√2)*(-1/√2) + 0*1 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) )= (-1/2) + (-1/2) = -1.

Row3: 0*(-1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(-1/√2) )= 1/√2.

So P v is [1/√2, -1, 1/√2]^T, which is -1 * v. So yes, correct.

Now for P=0, the eigenvector must satisfy P v =0.

Looking for vectors v that are orthogonal to the other eigenvectors? Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, we can find it by solving (P) v = 0.

Let me set up the equations.

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 +0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 +v3=0 → v3= -v1.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 =0 → same as equation 1, since v2=0.

So v2=0, v3= -v1. Let v1 be a parameter, say, 1. Then v3= -1. So the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, let me check if P v =0.

P is:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0 → 0*[1] + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1) =0 → 0.

Row2: (1/√2)*1 +0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) → (1/√2)(1-1) =0.

Row3: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1) →0.

Yes, so this vector is in the null space, so it's the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0.

So to recap, the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, -1, with eigenvectors:

P=1: [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T.

P=0: [1, 0, -1]^T.

P=-1: [-1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T.

Wait, but I should check if these eigenvectors are orthonormal. Let's see.

Take the eigenvectors for P=1 and P=-1.

Dot product: [1/√2, 1, 1/√2] · [-1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ] = ( -1/2 ) + 1 + (-1/2 ) = ( -1/2 -1/2 ) +1 = (-1) +1 =0. So they are orthogonal.

The eigenvector for P=0 is [1,0,-1]. Let's check its dot product with the others.

With P=1: [1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ] · [1, 0, -1 ] = (1/√2)*1 + 1*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2 -1/√2 )=0.

With P=-1: [-1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ] · [1,0,-1 ] = (-1/√2)*1 + 1*0 + (-1/√2)*(-1) → (-1/√2) + (1/√2) )=0.

So all three are mutually orthogonal. So the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis? Wait, because each eigenvector is normalized.

Wait, let's check the norms.

For P=1: (1/√2)^2 +1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2 +1 +1/2 )= (1/2 + 1/2 )=1 +1=2? Wait, no:

Wait, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2. So 1/2 +1 +1/2= (1/2 +1/2 )=1 +1=2. Oh wait, that's 2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the vector for P=1 is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ]^T which has a norm of sqrt( (1/2)+(1)+(1/2) )=sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, we need to divide by sqrt(2).

Ah, right! So the actual eigenvectors are:

For P=1: (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ) / sqrt(2) → (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2 )).

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute: each component is 1/√2, 1, 1/√2. The norm squared is (1/√2)^2 +1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )= 2. So the norm is sqrt(2), so the unit vector is [1/(√2 * sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) ] → [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2 ].

Wait, that's perhaps a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should have divided by sqrt(2) when normalizing. So the correct normalized eigenvectors are:

P=1: [1/(2), 1/√2, 1/(2) ]^T.

Wait, no. Let me compute it again. Each component is (1/√2), 1, (1/√2). The norm squared is (1/√2)^2 +1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) +1 + (1/2)= 2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the unit vector is [ (1/√2)/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), (1/√2)/sqrt(2) ].

Which simplifies to [1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) , 1/sqrt(2), 1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) ] → [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ].

Wait, because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2. So yes. So [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ].

Similarly, for P=-1: [-1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ] has a norm squared of (1/2 +1 +1/2 )= 2. So the normalized vector is [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

And the P=0 eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T, which has a norm squared of 1 +0 +1 =2. So the unit vector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

Wait, but earlier I thought the eigenvector for P=0 was [1,0,-1], which isn't normalized. So it's actually [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

So now, perhaps the state ψ can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenvectors.

Let me write ψ as (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 )^T.

We can express ψ as a sum of the eigenvectors of P multiplied by their coefficients.

So ψ = a |P=1> + b |P=0> + c |P=-1>.

Where |P=1> is [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2], |P=0> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)], and |P=-1> is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

Wait, but are these eigenvectors correct after normalization? Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of orthonormal basis. The eigenvectors of P are orthogonal but not necessarily normalized. So to find the coefficients, I can take the inner product of ψ with each eigenvector.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express ψ in terms of the eigenbasis of P. So the coefficients are the projections of ψ onto each eigenstate.

But maybe I should think about the measurement process. When you measure P, the state collapses into one of the eigenstates. The probability of getting each eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient in the expansion.

But in this problem, the measurement is first P, then Q. The question is: what's the probability that P is 0 and Q is -1?

Wait, but wait. The measurement is first P, then Q. So first, after measuring P, the state collapses into one of the P's eigenstates. Then, measuring Q on that state.

But the question is about getting P=0 and Q=-1. So we have to find the probability that, after measuring P and getting 0, then measuring Q gives -1.

Wait, no, the problem says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.

So the two steps are: measure P, get 0; then measure Q, get -1. So the joint probability is the probability of first getting 0 in P, then -1 in Q.

But wait, after measuring P=0, the state is the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, which is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Then, when measuring Q on this state, what's the probability of getting -1?

Wait, Q has eigenstates |Q=1> = [1,0,0], |Q=0> = [0,1,0], |Q=-1> = [0,0,1].

But the state after P=0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So the probability that Q is -1 is the square of the amplitude for |Q=-1> in this state.

So the amplitude is the inner product of the state with |Q=-1>.

The state is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

The |Q=-1> vector is [0,0,1].

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (1/2), so the probability is 1/2.

Wait, but that's the probability after P=0. So the overall probability is the probability of first getting P=0 multiplied by the probability of getting Q=-1 given P=0.

So the total probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0).

So now, what's P(P=0)? That's the probability of measuring 0 when measuring P, which is the square of the coefficient in ψ for the |P=0> eigenstate.

The |P=0> eigenstate is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

The inner product of ψ with this is:

ψ = [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ].

So inner product is (-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))(0) ) + (1/sqrt(6))(-1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(12)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(12)) ) ]

= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The square of the absolute value is (1/3), so P(P=0) is 1/3.

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, the state |P=0> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

The inner product with ψ is:

ψ^† * |P=0> = [ (-1/√6), (2/√6), (1/√6) ] · [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

So:

(-1/√6)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(-1/sqrt(2)).

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(12)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(12)) ).

So total is (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so this becomes (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The modulus squared is (1/3), so the probability is 1/3. Correct.

Then, after getting P=0, the state is |P=0>, which is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

When measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The probabilities are the square of the inner product with each of Q's eigenstates.

The state [1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)].

When measuring Q, the probability of getting -1 is | <Q=-1 | state> |^2.

The |Q=-1> vector is [0,0,1].

So the inner product is [0,0,1] · [1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)] = (-1/sqrt(2)).

So the square is (1/2).

Thus, the probability of Q=-1 given P=0 is 1/2.

So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the answer is D) 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the system's state, the operators \( P \) and \( Q \), and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system's initial state is given as \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are the diagonal entries: \( 1, 0, -1 \). The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

\[
|Q=1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |Q=0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |Q=-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the symmetric matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 
1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 1, 0, -1 \) (since the trace is zero and the determinant matches). The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:

\[
|P=1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 1/2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |P=0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ -1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix}, \quad |P=-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of Measuring \( P=0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P=0 \) is the square of the projection of \( \psi \) onto \( |P=0\rangle \). The projection is:

\[
\langle P=0 | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & -1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle P=0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle P=0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of Measuring \( Q=-1 \) After \( P=0 \)
After measuring \( P=0 \), the state collapses to \( |P=0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ -1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q=-1 \) is the square of the projection of this state onto \( |Q=-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \):

\[
\langle Q=-1 | P=0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ -1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle Q=-1 | P=0 \rangle|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Joint Probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P=0 \) and \( Q=-1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of getting \( P=0 \) and \( Q=-1 \) is:
