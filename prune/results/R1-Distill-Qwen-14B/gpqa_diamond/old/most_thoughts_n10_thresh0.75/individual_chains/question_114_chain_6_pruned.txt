Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, I've got two reactions here, and I need to find the right reagents for each step. Hmm, let me break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh wait, I remember that when ketones react with CN- in an acid-catalyzed condition, it's a nucleophilic addition. So, the mechanism is probably the enolate formation or just the enol attacking the cyanide.

Wait, but butan-2-one has two methyl groups adjacent to the carbonyl. So when NaCN is added with an acid catalyst, the ketone would undergo addition of the cyanide ion. But wait, wait, what's the product here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. It's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the carbonyl group becomes an alcohol and a nitrile group attached.

Wait, but how does that happen? Normally, adding CN to a ketone would give a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation reaction where the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, then protonation occurs. But in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure would
