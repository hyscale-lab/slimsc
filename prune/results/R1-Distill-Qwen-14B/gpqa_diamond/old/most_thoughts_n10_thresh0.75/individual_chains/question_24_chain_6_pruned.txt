Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. So, there's this mixture X which is equimolar of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Hmm, wait, decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of alkenes or maybe some other unsaturated bonds. Oh yeah, because alkenes react with bromine to form dibromides, which causes the bromine water to decolorize.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. This Y is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids, and importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y doesn't have any unsaturated bonds, maybe they are all single bonds now.

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they produce only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Oh, and Z is part of mixture Y, which makes sense because Y is the product after some reaction that might hydrogenate some parts. Also, Z is a solvent, which often implies it's something like toluene or maybe a benzene derivative, but wait, let's think more.

So, Z's hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that means. The mass fraction is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7, since 14.28 is roughly 14.2857, which is 1/7th. So, the molar mass of Z can be determined from the hydrogen content.

Hydrogen has a molar mass of about 1 g/mol. If the mass fraction of H is 14.28%, then the mass contributed by hydrogen is 14.28% of the molar mass of Z.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the molecular formula of Z is CxHy. The molar mass would be (12x + y). The mass of H is y*(1) = y g/mol. So, y / (12x + y) = 14.28/100.

So, 14.28 is 1/7 of 100, so 14.28% is 1/7. Hence, y/(12x + y) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying, 7y = 12x + y → 6y = 12x → y = 2x.

So, the formula is CxH2x. That simplifies to CxH2x, which is a saturated compound since all bonds are single. Wait, but wait, let me think. So, if it's a hydrocarbon with hydrogen 14.28%, and y=2x, then substituting into the mass fraction equation:

Hydrogen mass = (2x *1) / (12x + 2x) = 2x/(14x) = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. That matches.

So, Z is a hydrocarbon with formula CxH2x. Let's find the possible x. Since Z is a widely used solvent, common ones are like toluene (C7H8), which has x=7, but wait, toluene is C7H8, which would give y=8, and x=7. Then y=8, which is not 2x (14). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Wait, no, the formula is CxH2x, so it's like even number of H? Let me think. What about ethane? No, that's C1H2, but ethane is a gas, not a solvent. Maybe a bigger alkane?

Wait, another possibility: Z is cyclohexane? No, cyclohexane is C6H12. Let's see: x=6, y=12. Then y=2x=12, which fits. So, 6*12 +12=72+12=84 g/mol. Hydrogen is 12 g/mol. 12/84 = 1/7, which is about 14.28%. Oh, that's right.

So, Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12. Wait, but cyclohexane is a solvent, yes. So, that seems to fit.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, all single bonds. So, when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So, X must have some double bonds or triple bonds that, when hydrogenated, become single.

Wait, but the problem says that mixture X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, X contains alkenes, which react with bromine. When treated with platinum and heat, which is a catalyst, probably a hydrogenation reaction, but it's a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, wait, the question says it's a disproportionation reaction forming Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So, Y has no double bonds.

Wait, let me think. So, the reaction is a disproportionation. So, perhaps one compound in X is being both oxidized and reduced. But wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids. So, X is two alkenes, perhaps, which under hydrogenation (Pt, H2?) would become alkanes. But wait, no, hydrogenation would add H2. But the question says that when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. Alternatively, maybe the treatment with Pt and heat is a different reaction, like dehydrohalogenation or something else.

Wait, wait, let me re-read. So, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y. But then, both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, X and Y, when each is hydrogenated, give Z.

Wait, that can't be. Because if X is hydrogenated, you get Z, which is a single product. So, X is a mixture of two alkenes (since they decolorize bromine), and when they are hydrogenated, both give the same Z. So, that implies that both alkenes in X hydrogenate to the same alkane Z.

Wait, but that's only possible if both alkenes are in such a way that they hydrogenate to the same product. That would require that their structures are such that adding hydrogen across the double bonds leads to the same molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps each alkene in X is such that when hydrogenated, it gives Z. So, each component of X, when hydrogenated, gives Z.

Wait, but Z is a single product. So, each component of X, upon hydrogenation, gives Z. So, X has two alkenes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives the same alkane.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So, for example, if X is a mixture of two different alkenes that hydrogenate to the same alkane. How is that possible? Because normally, different alkenes would give different alkanes upon hydrogenation.

Wait, unless the alkenes have different structures but upon hydrogenation, their structures become the same. For example, if you have two different dienes but when hydrogenated, they become the same structure. Wait, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are isomers, and when hydrogenated, they both become the same alkane. But that would require that the alkenes are geometric isomers, but upon hydrogenation, they become the same structure.

Wait, but if the alkenes are in such positions that hydrogenation leads to the same molecule, maybe they are conjugated in some way. But the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So, X's alkenes are isolated or something, but not conjugated.

Hmm, maybe the alkenes are in such positions that when hydrogenated, the result is the same. For instance, if you have 1,3-pentadiene and 1,2-pentadiene, but wait, those would hydrogenate to the same molecule, perhaps.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that in mixture X, there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So, perhaps the alkenes in X are non-conjugated, but each would hydrogenate to the same molecule. Hmm, perhaps they are different alkenes that when hydrogenated give the same alkane.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Z is a cyclic compound like cyclohexane, which comes from hydrogenating a diene. So, if X has two different dienes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But that doesn't make much sense because each diene would hydrogenate to a different product.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes which upon hydrogenation both form the same product, Z. So, each alkene must be such that when hydrogen is added, they result in the same structure.

Wait, another thought: maybe one of the alkenes in X is a cyclic diene, which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. The other component could be another diene that also becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. For example, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would hydrogenate to cyclohexane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes that each hydrogenate to the same product. For example, suppose X has both 1-pentene and 3-pentene. But when hydrogenated, each would form pentane, but that's a single product. But then Z would be pentane, but let's check the hydrogen fraction. Let's see: pentane is C5H1
