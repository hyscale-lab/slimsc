Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I'm trying to remember what this represents. Oh right, this looks like a two-dimensional metric, so it's probably describing some sort of space, maybe a surface embedded in higher dimensions. Pseudosphere... that's like a sphere but with negative curvature, right? Or wait, no, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature.

But wait, what's the area of a pseudosphere? I think the area is finite but depends on the radius. Oh right, for a pseudosphere (which is a surface with hyperbolic geometry), the area is 4πr², similar to a regular sphere, but wait, wait, I thought pseudospheres have different properties. Or wait, no, maybe the area is similar. Wait, no, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and its total area is finite. For a pseudosphere of radius r, I think the area is 4πr², but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, isn't that the same formula as a regular sphere? Oh, right, because the pseudosphere's area formula is similar, but the radius is kind of a scaling factor for the curvature.

But wait, the metric given here is in terms
