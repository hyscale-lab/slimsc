Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out. So, the question is about identifying the correct starting materials A and B for two different reactions that produce the same product but with different stereochemistry. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from reaction A, and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from reaction B. The reagents used are LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is also a reducing agent but maybe works under different conditions. Wait, no, wait a second—BH3 is typically used in the formation of ketones from aldehydes and ketones, but I might be mixing things up. Oh right, actually, BH3 is commonly used in the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which follows anti-Markovnikov addition. But wait, in this case, since the products are ketones, maybe the starting materials are esters or something else. Oh wait, wait—LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters to alcohols. Or wait, wait, no, LiBH4 can reduce ketones? Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm.

Wait, I think I should start by looking at the product. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that
