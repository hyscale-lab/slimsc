Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear decay and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there's a decay process where two heavy nucleons of flavor A convert into two of flavor B, and emit two lighter particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's mentioned that the total energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous with some endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. The question is how the E spectrum compares in this case. The options are A to D, each talking about whether the spectrum is continuous or discrete and whether the endpoint increases or decreases.

Hmm, I remember that in radioactive decay, when particles are emitted, their energy distribution can be continuous or discrete. For example, beta decay emits electrons with a continuous spectrum, but that's when the emitted particle is a beta particle and possibly an antineutrino. Wait, but in this case, it's about E particles.

Wait, in the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. So each E and V is a lighter particle. The E particles have a continuous spectrum. So for each E, the energy can vary, but the total energy of all E's together is fixed by the decay's Q value.

But when the decay changes to emit M instead of two V's, what happens?

Wait, the original decay emits 2E and 2V. The variant emits 1M, so perhaps the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. But wait, the problem says it's a variant that emits one M instead of the two V's. So in the original, there were 2V, and in the variant, 1M, but wait, in the original decay, it's 2V particles emitted; in the variant, it's one M.

But the question is about the energy spectrum of E. So how does the presence of M affect the E spectrum?

I think this is related to conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think about the original decay.

In the original case, 2A decays into 2B, 2E, and 2V. Since E and V are lighter particles, their energies are part of the decay products.

In the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. That suggests that in that decay, the E particles can have a range of energies, from 0 up to some maximum (endpoint Q). But wait, in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the process also emits a neutrino, and the energy is shared between the electron and neutrino. So the electron's energy is not fixed because the neutrino takes away some energy. But in this case, if E and V are both emitted, maybe they share energy, leading to a continuous spectrum for E.

In the variant, instead of two V's, they emit one M. M is massless, so its energy is just its momentum times c squared, but since it's massless, E = pc. So M would be like a photon or a neutrino, which carries away energy and momentum.

Wait, so
