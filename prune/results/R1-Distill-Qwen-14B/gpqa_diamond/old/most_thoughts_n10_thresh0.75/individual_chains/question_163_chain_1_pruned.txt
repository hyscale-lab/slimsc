Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide and when it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4, it will undergo a neutralization reaction. The acid will donate H+ ions, and the hydroxide will donate OH- ions. The reaction should produce water and the corresponding salt. Since it's a monobasic acid, each molecule can donate one H+.

First, I need to find out the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 to determine how many moles of it we have. The formula is Fe(OH)3. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for each OH3 group, that's 16 + 3(1) = 19 g/mol. Fe(OH)3 has one Fe, three O, and three H, so 55.85 + 3*(16) + 3*(1) = 55.85 +48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 55.85 (Fe) + 3*(16) (O) = 48, and 3*(1) (H) is 3. So 55.85 + 48 +3 is 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol gives moles.

0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.000936 moles. Let's compute that: 0.1 divided by 106.85 is about 0.000936 mol.

So, Fe(OH)3 (s) + H+ (aq) → Fe^3+ (aq) + H2O (l). But wait, the reaction is more accurately written as Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 H+ to produce Fe^3+ and 3 H2O. Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So the mole ratio is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 to 3 moles H+.

So, moles of H+ needed = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3.

Which is 3 × 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of H+.

Wait, is that right? Let's see. Each mole of Fe(OH)3
