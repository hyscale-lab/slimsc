Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are between cis and trans propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that acetates are esters, so the general structure would be R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, wait, acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is the alkyl group. So the structure would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acetate is CH3COO- as the ester. So the structure is an ester where the acyl group is acetyl (CH3COO-) and the R group is an alkyl or alkenyl group.

Looking at the options, the compounds are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, wait. Actually, propenyl could be either CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, propenyl would be an allyl group. Let me think: propenyl would have three carbons, with a double bond. So the structure could be CH2=CHCH2-OAc or maybe CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond elsewhere. Wait, wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. But the exact structure of the substituent would depend on whether it's cis or trans.

Wait, but the NMR data given: the peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), and 1.6 (3H, d). Let's think about each part.

The 2.1 ppm singlet with 3H is likely the acetyl group's methyl (OAc is CH3COO-). So that makes sense. The 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group. Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to another CH group.

Looking at the protons in
