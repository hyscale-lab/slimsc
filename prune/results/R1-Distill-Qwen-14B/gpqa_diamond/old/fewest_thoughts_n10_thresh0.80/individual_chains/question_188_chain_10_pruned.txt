Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( l² + m² + n² - (l m cos α + m n cos β + n l cos γ) ), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Or was it just the simple d = a / sqrt( l² + m² + n² ) when the angles are 90 degrees?

Wait, the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. So alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait—rhombohedral means a special case where a=b=c and the angles are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, a=b=c=10 Angstrom, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So the formula for the interplanar distance d for a general plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is a bit tricky. I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ), because in rhombohedral, the angles are all same. But wait, wait, wait—I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is derived from the unit cell vectors. For a general triclinic system, the formula is more complicated, but for rhombohedral, since a=b=c and angles are same, maybe we can simplify.

Wait, I think the general formula is d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ + hk cos γ + ... )? No, maybe it's better to refer back to the textbook formula. The Miller indices are (hkl), so the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + kl cos α + lh cos α) )

Wait, since α=β=γ=30 degrees, because all angles are same in rhombohedral. So cos
