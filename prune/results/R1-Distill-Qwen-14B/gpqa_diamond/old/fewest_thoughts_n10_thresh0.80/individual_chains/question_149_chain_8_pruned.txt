Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, I've got a question about a peptidic compound's NMR and LC-MS analysis. Hmm, I need to figure out what's going on here based on the observations.

So, the scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptide that's been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. They ruled out spin-spin coupling, so it's not that. 

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So, same molecular weight but two peaks. 

What's going on? Let's think about the possibilities. The options are A to D. 

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the MS would probably show a different mass. The question says both peaks have the same mass, so probably not A. 

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, they would look identical because the environments are the same. But wait, in some cases, like in achiral solvents, enantiomers would have the same NMR. However, if the mixture is not 50/50, would the peaks integrate differently? Wait, the question says the integrals add up to 1H. So if each peak is integrating to 0.5H, that suggests that each is present in equal amounts. But if it's an enantiomeric mixture, their NMR would be identical, so why two peaks? So perhaps this isn't the reason, because the NMR would have the same shifts. Hmm, maybe not. Or maybe in the case of diastereomers, you could have different shifts. Wait, but enantiomers have the same shifts. So the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton. Unless they're in a different environment. Wait, but the question says the same alpha-proton. So the same H in each enantiomer. So their NMR would superimpose, leading to a single peak. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide formation. Double coupling refers to when a proton
