Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about determining the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. The planets are part of a system discovered using the TTV method, but I don't think that part matters for the calculation. The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and the fact that their albedos are all 0.3.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature (Te) is something like:

Te = [ (L / (16πσ)) * (1 - A) / (d^2) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the albedo, and d is the distance from the star. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that part cancels out when taking the ratios.

Wait, the question gives the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4. So Te1/Te2 = 1.4. Similarly, Te2/Te3 = 2.3.

I think I can write the equilibrium temperature ratio in terms of their distances. Let me rearrange the formula:

Te ∝ sqrt( (1 - A) ) / d^(1/2) )

Wait, no, because the formula has 1/d^2 inside the fourth root. So, Te ∝ 1/d^(1/2), because (1/d^2)^(1/4) is 1/d^(0.5). So, Te is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

So, the ratio of Te1 to Te2 would be sqrt(d2/d1). Because:

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

Similarly, Te2/Te3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

Wait, let's check that. Let me write it out:

Te = [ (L(1-A)/(16πσ)) * (1/d^2) ]^(1/4)

So, Te is proportional to (1/d^2)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2).

So, Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Because Te1 is proportional to 1/d1, Te2 to 1/d2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If Te1 is for Planet1, which is at distance d1, then Te1 = k / d1^0.5, where k is a constant. Similarly, Te2 = k / d2^0.5. So, Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^(0.5).

Yes, that makes sense. So, if Te1/Te2 is 1.4, then sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4.

So, d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3, Te2/Te3 is 2.3, so sqrt(d3/d2) = 2.3. Therefore, d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 = about 5.29.

So, d3/d1 = (d3/d2) * (d2/d1) ) = 5.29 * 1.96.

Calculating that: 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 * 1.96 is about 0.5684, so total about 10.3684. So d3 is approximately 10.37 times d1.

Wait, but orbital period relates to the distance through Kepler's third law. Right, Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So, P^2 ∝ d^3 / M*, where M* is the mass of the star. But wait, the question gives mass ratios between the planets, not the star. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, the problem gives the mass ratios between the planets, not the star. So I'm a bit confused. The question says the mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So, M1/M2 = 1.15, and M2/M3 = 1.35.

Wait, but Kepler's third law for planets in orbit around a star (assuming the star's mass is much larger than the planets) is P^2 = (4π²/GM*) * a^3, where a is the semi-major axis (distance d). So, if the star's mass is M*, then the period depends on M*.

But in this problem, the question is about the planets' orbital periods. So, each planet is orbiting the same star, right? Because they are in the same system. So, the star's mass is the same for all three planets. So, when we take the ratio of their periods, the star's mass cancels out.

So, for each planet i: Pi^2 = (4π²/(G M*)) * di^3.

So, Pi / Pj = (di^3 / dj^3 )^(1/2) = ( (di/dj) )^(3/2).

So, the ratio of periods Pi/Pj is (di/dj)^(3/2).

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2).

We found that d3/d1 is about 10.37, so P3 is (10.37)^(3/2) times P1.

Wait, but wait, 10.37 to the 3/2 power. Let me compute that.

First, sqrt(10.37) is about 3.22, because 3.2^2 is 10.24, and 3.22^2 is about 10.368. So, 10.37^(1/2) ≈ 3.22.

Then, 10.37^(3/2) is (10.37^1) * (10.37^(1/2)) ) = 10.37 * 3.22 ≈ 33.33.

So, P3 is about 33.3 times P1.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let's double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me recompute the steps.

First, Te ratios:

Te1/Te2 = 1.4 → sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4 → d2/d1 = 1.
