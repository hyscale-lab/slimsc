Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll remember what I can.

The question says that originally, two heavy nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's and emit two E and two V particles. The reaction is written as 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles' energy spectrum is continuous with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V's, an exotic, massless particle M is emitted. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the E's energy spectrum changes in this variant compared to the original.

I remember that in beta decay, when a neutron turns into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum. The maximum energy (endpoint) corresponds to the case where all the energy goes into the electron, assuming the neutrino is massless. But wait, in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but maybe in this problem we can treat M as massless, similar to neutrinos.

So in the original decay, E and V are being emitted. If V has mass, that changes the energy distribution. The continuous spectrum occurs because the emitted particles share the energy, and their kinetic energies can vary. The maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the available Q value, considering the masses of the emitted particles.

In the original case, 2V are emitted. Let's say each V has mass m. Then the total energy available for the E particles would be Q minus the energy needed to create the two V's and any kinetic energy they have.

In the variant, those two V's are replaced by one M. Since M is massless, it doesn't contribute to the rest mass, but its kinetic energy will play a role. So now, instead of two particles with mass, we have one massless particle.

Wait, but how does this affect the energy available for the E's? Let me think about energy and momentum conservation.

In the original decay, each E and V would carry away some energy. The E's have some mass, right? Or are they massless? The problem says E and V are much lighter, but it doesn't specify if they're massless. Hmm. But the M is massless, so maybe E and V have negligible mass, or perhaps E has mass and V doesn't? Not sure, but perhaps that detail isn't crucial for this thought process.

In the original case, the decay produces 2E and 2V. The continuous spectrum for E arises because the E's share energy with the V's. The maximum energy of E occurs when the V's take as little energy as possible (like at rest if possible), but since they have mass, their minimum kinetic energy is zero, but if they are emitted, they must have
