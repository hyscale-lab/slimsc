Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Oh, wait, but the given vector doesn't look normalized. Let me check that.

The state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To normalize it, I need to compute the square of the magnitude: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1,2,1]^T. But wait, the problem mentions the state at time t is given by that column matrix. So perhaps it's already normalized, or maybe it's not, but the problem might just proceed regardless, but I think I'll have to consider normalization because probabilities are involved.

Next, the operators P and Q. Let's look at their matrices.

Operator P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, that doesn't look like a Hermitian matrix, which is necessary for an observable. Oh, wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check:

Hermitian matrices are equal to their conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real here, it's equal to its transpose. Let's see if P is symmetric.

Looking at P's matrix:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So the matrix is:

0    1/√2    0
1/√2  0    1/√2
0    1/√2    0

Transposing this would swap elements. For example, element (1,2) becomes (2,1), which is the same as (1,2) in this case. Similarly, (2,3) becomes (3,2), which matches. So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So it's a valid observable.

Operator Q's matrix is diagonal:
Row 1: 1,0,0
Row 2: 0,0,0
Row 3: 0,0,-1.

That's definitely Hermitian because it's real and diagonal, so it's also an observable.

The question is: If someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, no, the wording says: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P," so the measurements are in sequence: first P, then Q. But the wording of the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the exact wording is: "what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" So it's the joint probability for first measuring P=0, then measuring Q=-1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So when P is measured first, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, after that, when Q is measured, the state is in that collapsed state.

So the approach is:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.
2. Determine which eigenvectors correspond to the eigenvalue 0 for P.
3. Compute the probability that the initial state collapses to each such eigenvector.
4. Then, for each such eigenvector, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 when the state is that eigenvector.
5. Multiply the probabilities (the probability of collapsing into that eigenvector times the probability of measuring -1 for Q in that state) for each eigenvector, then sum them for all such eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to first find the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0, express the initial state as a linear combination of these eigenvectors and other eigenvectors, then when P is measured, the state collapses to the component in the 0-eigenspace. Then, from that, compute the probability of Q=-1.

Wait, but perhaps P has multiple eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

So, the matrix P is as given.

To find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

But for a 3x3 matrix, this might be a bit involved, but perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by inspection or other means.

Let me compute the characteristic equation for P.

The matrix P is:

[ 0      1/√2    0      ]
[1/√2   0      1/√2   ]
[ 0      1/√2    0      ]

So, P - λ I is:

[ -λ      1/√2    0      ]
[1/√2    -λ      1/√2   ]
[ 0      1/√2    -λ      ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using the rule for 3x3 determinants.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues by considering the structure of P.

Looking at P, I notice that it's a symmetric matrix with a particular pattern. Maybe it's a tridiagonal matrix. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess that P has eigenvalues. Let me try to see if I can find some eigenvectors.

Let me consider a vector [a, b, a]^T, because the matrix P has some symmetry.

Assume [a, b, a]^T is an eigenvector. Let's see if that's possible.

Multiply P by this vector:

P * [a; b; a] = [ (1/√2)*b , (1/√2)(a) + (1/√2)(a) , (1/√2)*b ].

Wait, let me compute each component:

First component: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*a = (b)/√2.

Second component: (1/√2)*a + 0*b + (1/√2)*a = (2a)/√2 = a*sqrt(2).

Third component: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*a = (b)/√2.

So the result is [b/√2, a√2, b/√2].

For this to be an eigenvector, this must be equal to λ times [a; b; a].

So,

b/√2 = λ a.

a√2 = λ b.

b/√2 = λ a.

So from first and third equations, same equation: λ a = b/√2.

From the second equation: λ b = a√2.

Let me substitute b from first equation into the second: λ (λ a * sqrt(2)) ) = a√2.

Wait, perhaps I should substitute.

From first equation: b = λ a sqrt(2).

Putting into second equation: λ * (λ a sqrt(2)) ) = a sqrt(2).

So λ^2 a sqrt(2) = a sqrt(2).

Assuming a ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by a sqrt(2): λ^2 = 1 → λ = ±1.

So possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Wait, but wait, let's check for λ=1.

If λ=1, then from first equation: b = (1)*a * sqrt(2) → b = a * sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector would be [a, a√2, a]^T. So any scalar multiple, so we can set a=1, for example.

Check if this works.

Wait, but let's compute P times [1; sqrt(2); 1].

P * [1; sqrt(2); 1] = first component: (1/√2) * sqrt(2) = (sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) )= 1.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + (1/√2)*1 = (2/√2) )= sqrt(2).

Third component: (1/√2) * sqrt(2) )= 1.

So the result is [1, sqrt(2), 1]. Comparing to λ times the original vector [1; sqrt(2); 1], which is [1, sqrt(2), 1], which is the same as the result. So yes, λ=1 is an eigenvalue with eigenvector [1; sqrt(2); 1].

Similarly, for λ = -1.

From the first equation: b = (-1) * a * sqrt(2) → b = -a sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector would be [a; -a sqrt(2); a]^T.

Check by multiplying P with this vector.

First component: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-a sqrt(2)) )= (1/sqrt(2)) * (-a sqrt(2)) )= -a.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2)) a + (1/sqrt(2)) a = (2a)/sqrt(2) )= a sqrt(2).

Third component: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-a sqrt(2)) )= -a.

So P * [a; -a sqrt(2); a] = [ -a, a sqrt(2), -a ].

Which is equal to (-1) * [a; -a sqrt(2); a], so yes, λ=-1 is an eigenvalue.

So now, so far, we have two eigenvalues: 1 and -1.

But wait, the matrix is 3x3, so there should be a third eigenvalue. Maybe zero.

Let me
