Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius. That's near room temperature, so B is probably a solid at that point. 

First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The problem says it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X might be a compound that has an isotope, maybe heavier than the usual. Also, it reacts violently with a liquid Y. I'm thinking that Y could be water because a lot of reactions with metals are violent, especially group 1 metals. 

When metals like sodium or potassium react with water, they produce hydrogen gas (H2), which is gas W. Let's check the properties of gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hydrogen gas is H2, so each hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Wait, that doesn't fit because 0 neutrons can't equal 1 proton. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Alternatively, maybe the gas isn't hydrogen.

Another possibility is carbon dioxide, but I don't think that's produced by metals reacting with water. Or perhaps another gas. Wait, what about nitrogen gas? No, that's from decomposition reactions maybe. Let's think again.

Wait, the gas has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think about molecules. For example, H2O has 8 protons (since O is 8) and 8 neutrons in the molecule? Wait, no, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, but H has 1 each. So H2O has 2 H (each 1p, 0n?) Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the gas is CH4? No, because each CH4 molecule has 6 protons (from C) and 4*(each H is 1 proton). So 6 + 4*1 =10 protons, and the neutrons? Carbon has 6 neutrons (since C-12 is 6 p and 6 n), and each H has 0
