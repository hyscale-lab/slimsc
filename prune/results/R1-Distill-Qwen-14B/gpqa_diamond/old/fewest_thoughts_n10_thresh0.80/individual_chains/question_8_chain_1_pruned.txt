Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again. 

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've identified three genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and also some double mutants. 

The setup says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to their promoters. So, if one gene is a transcription factor, it probably controls the expression of the other genes.

The experiment results give the resistance percentages of each mutant compared to the wild-type. Wild-type is 100%, so any lower percentage means the mutant is more susceptible. 

Looking at the data:

- g1 (G1 knockout) has 75% resistance. So, less than wild-type but not super bad. So G1 is involved but not absolutely essential.
- g2 (G2 knockout) has 0% resistance. That's a big deal; without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. So G2 is probably critical.
- g3 (G3 knockout) has 50% resistance. So it's worse than wild-type, but not as bad as g2.
- The double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is even worse than either alone. g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. g1g2 is also 0%.

Hmm. Let me think about how these interact. 

First, the single mutants: G2 knockout is the most severe. So G2 is probably the most important for resistance. Maybe it's the transcription factor since knocking it out completely wrecks the resistance. 

Now, G1 knockout is only 75% resistance. So when G1 is missing, the plant is still 75% as resistant as wild-type. So G1 contributes, but not as much as G2.

G3 knockout is 50% resistance. So without G3, the plant is only half as resistant.

Now looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0% resistance. So without both G1 and G2, the plant can't resist at all. But wait, the G2 knockout alone is already 0%, so adding G1 knockout doesn't make it worse. Because 0% is the same as g2 alone. So in this case, G2 is upstream of G1, or maybe G1 is redundant in another pathway. Alternatively, perhaps G1 is in a separate pathway that doesn't contribute as much as G2. But when both are knocked out, it's the same as G2 knocked out. Hmm.

Wait, g1g3 is 10%. So the double mutant of G1 and G3 is worse than each single, but not as bad as g2 or the other double without G2. So G1 and G3 have some additive effect, but without G2, it's still 0%.

The other double mutant, g2g3, is 0%, same as G2 knockout. So knocking out G2 and G3 together doesn't make it worse than G2 alone. That suggests that G3's function is downstream of G2 or in the same pathway.

Now, what about the idea of transcription factors. The problem says that one is a transcription factor upstream of others. Since G2 knockout is the most severe and completely blocks resistance, maybe G2 is the transcription factor. Because without it, nothing works, perhaps because it's activating other genes needed for resistance. 

So, if G2 is a transcription factor, that would explain why g2 is so bad. Because it's controlling other genes. So G1 and G3 might be downstream of G2.

Looking at the knockouts:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2. Because without G2, resistance is 0%, but without G1, it's 75%. So perhaps G2 activates G1, which in turn does something. But without G1, some other mechanism (like G2 activating another gene) provides 75% resistance. So G1 is not the only gene downstream of G2.

g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the resistance is halved. That suggests that G3 is also downstream of G2, perhaps in a different pathway.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10% resistance. That's worse than either single. So the combined loss of G1 and G3 has a much bigger effect than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So without both, the plant is even more susceptible.

Wait, but if G2 is the transcription factor, then in the double mutants that include G2, like g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0%, same as G2 knockout. So G2's knockout masks the effect of any other gene's knockout.

Now, what about the fact that when you have g1g2, which is G1 and G2 knocked out, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G1's knockout doesn't add any additional effect beyond G2's. That suggests that G1 is downstream of G2. Because without G2, G1's presence doesn't matter. So G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, when you knock out G2 and G3, it's still 0%, same as G2. So perhaps G3 is also downstream of G2.
