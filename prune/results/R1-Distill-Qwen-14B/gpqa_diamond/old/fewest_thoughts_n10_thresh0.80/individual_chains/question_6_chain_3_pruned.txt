Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Wait, so it's a two-dimensional problem because it's using polar coordinates (r, θ). I remember that in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation can sometimes be solved by separating variables, especially if the potential has certain symmetries.

Looking at the potential, I see two terms: one is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The other term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, let me think about what that looks like. Cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos 2θ) / 2 ].

Wait, let me compute that. Expanding it: 3/2 * (1/2) is 3/4, so the second term becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos 2θ). So the whole potential becomes V = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ. Let me combine the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) is (5/4)k r². So, V = (5/4 k r²) + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ.

Hmm, that simplifies to V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ. Now, can I separate this into terms that depend only on r and terms that depend only on θ? Because for separation of variables, the potential should be expressible as a sum of functions each depending on only one variable.

Wait, but the first term is r², which is purely r-dependent. The second term is r² cos 2θ, which is r² multiplied by a function of θ.
