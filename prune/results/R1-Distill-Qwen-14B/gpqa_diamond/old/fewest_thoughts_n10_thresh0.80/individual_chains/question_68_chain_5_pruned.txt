Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in different magnetic fields. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have their magnetic moments related to their spin. The question mentions that the magnetic moment mu is given by gamma multiplied by Sz, where Sz is the spin component along the magnetic field direction.

Alright, let's break down the scenario. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. So the magnetic moment mu is aligned with B, which is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned, so its energy state is probably the lowest since the magnetic moment is in the same direction as the field.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off. Wait, but another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude, B. So now the magnetic field is along Y instead of Z.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh right, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the dynamics of the system.

I think the key here is to model the system using quantum mechanics, particularly time-dependent perturbation theory, but maybe it's simpler since the change is sudden and we're looking for oscillation frequency.

Wait, when the magnetic field is along Z initially, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. But when the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma * B * Sy. Oh wait, or is it? Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, so the interaction energy is mu · B. So when B is along Y, the Hamiltonian would be H = -gamma * B * Sy. Because mu is gamma times the spin, so mu · B would be gamma * (S · B), and since B is along Y, it's gamma * S_y multiplied by B, but wait, the energy is -mu·B, right? So H = -gamma * B * Sy?

Wait, no, the energy is H = - mu · B. Because the potential energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is given by U = - mu · B. So if mu is gamma * S, then H = - gamma * S · B.

So when B is along Z, H_initial is -gamma B S_z. And when B switches to Y, H_final is - gamma B S_y.

But this is a spin-1/2 system. The spin matrices for S_x, S_y, S_z are all proportional to the Pauli matrices, right? So S_x = (ħ/2) sigma_x, same for S_y and S_z.

Wait, but units and constants can be tricky. Let me see: The spin angular momentum S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, etc.

But the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -gamma B S_y. So substituting S_y, H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the energy eigenstates and how they change.

Wait, the initial state of the system before the field is switched is an eigenstate of S_z. Because the initial magnetic
