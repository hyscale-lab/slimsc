Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's this vector d which is from the point where the field was generated at time tr (some earlier time) to the observation point r. At time tr, the charge's velocity is v. The task is to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr.

Wait, right, the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations, right? But I remember that when charges are moving, especially with relativistic speeds, things get a bit more complicated than the static case.

In the static case, the scalar potential V is just (q)/(4πε0 r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point r. But when the charge is moving, I think there's a correction because the charge's velocity affects the potentials.

Oh, right! The vector potential A comes into play. For a moving charge, the vector potential isn't zero anymore. I recall that A is related to the velocity of the charge.

Wait, what's the expression again? I think there's a term that involves the velocity v of the charge and the vector d, which is the displacement from where the field was generated to the observation point.

Hmm, I also remember something about the Lorentz transformation affecting the potentials when charges are moving. But wait, no, maybe that's more about how fields transform. Let me think about the potentials themselves.

The scalar potential V is usually given by the static term, but modified by any time delays or other effects. The vector potential A is more directly dependent on the motion.

Oh, the Lienard's potentials! Right, Lienard's formulas are used when charges are in motion. Let me recall them.

The scalar potential due to a charge in motion is something like V = (q/c²) times some term involving the velocity and the vector d. Similarly, the vector potential A would involve the velocity as well.

Wait, the general form I remember is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [ (1/(d c - v·d)) ) ] * something. Hmm, not quite sure about the exact expression.

Wait, the denominator is probably (d c - v · d), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. Or wait, I think d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to r. So the distance between them is d, but the exact expression might involve the dot product of d and v, where v is the velocity at tr.

So, the scalar potential V would be (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - v·d)), and the vector potential A would be (μ0 qc v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: V is the static term, and A is v squared over c squared times V. That seems off because I don't think A would have v squared. Also, the denominator in the static term is r, but I think it's actually (d c - v·d) instead of just r. So probably A isn't correct.

Option B: Same static V, and A is v over c squared times V. Hmm, but I think the denominator should involve (d c - v·d), not just r. So probably wrong.

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε0 (dc - v·d)), and A is (μ0 qc v)/(4π (dc - v·d})). Wait, that looks more like what I was thinking. The denominator is (d c - v·d) for both, and the vector potential is proportional to the velocity. But wait, in the denominator, it's (d c - v·d), which is the same as c times the distance minus the projection of v onto d times distance? Or maybe more accurately, the denominator is (d c - v · d) where d is a vector, so it's a vector calculation. But in the options, it's written as dc - vec{d} · vec{v}, which is scalar. So the denominator is a scalar.

But wait, when you have vector d and scalar factors, the denominator would be a scalar term. So option C has that for both V and A. Let's check:

V(r,t) = qc/(4πε0 (d c - v·d)).

And A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Wait, but I thought the vector potential A is in the direction of the velocity v. So the vector potential would be proportional to v, but in the same expression as V, but scaled by μ0 and other constants.

Option C's vector potential is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (denominator)), which seems right because when you have a moving charge, the A is proportional to v, and the denominator is the same as in V.

Option D: The denominator is (d c + v·d), so that's different. I think the denominator should be (d c - v·d) because the light travel time is involved, and the charge's motion affects the delay. So D's denominator is opposite in sign, so probably incorrect.

So comparing options C and D, I think C is the correct one. Because the denominator is (d c - v·d), which aligns with what I remember about the Lienard potentials.

Wait, another thing: the vector potential A is (μ0 q v)/(4π c) multiplied by some factor. Let's see: In option C, the A is (μ0 q c v) divided by (4 pi (denominator)). Wait, but what's the standard expression for A when the charge is moving?

Wait, I think the vector potential A is (μ0 q v)/(4π c) * (something). Let me think: the static case for A is zero, right? Because for a charge at rest, the vector potential is due to current, but a static charge has no current. So when the charge moves, A becomes non-zero.

The general expression for A would be (μ0 q)/(4π c) times (v/( (r - d)^2 - (v t_r)^2 )) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potentials in terms of the Liénard's formula.

Liéniard's scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε0)) [ (1 + (v/c)^2 ) / ( r'^2 - (v t_r)^2 )^{1/2} } ] where r' is the distance at time tr. Wait, maybe that's more complicated than I thought.

Alternatively, another approach: when the charge is moving, the potentials are affected by the velocity. The scalar potential V should still depend on the charge, but perhaps corrected by a factor due to the velocity. The vector potential A would come from the current due to the moving charge.

Wait, the vector potential is usually given by A = (μ0 I )/(4π) something. But since the charge is moving, the current is I = q v, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the current element for a moving charge is J = q v δ(...), but when you're finding the vector potential from a moving charge, it's like a current distribution.

Another way: The vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge. So the general form is A = (μ0 q v )/(4π c) * something.

Looking back at the options, in option C, the vector potential is (μ0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c - v·d)).

Wait, but wait, units might help. Let's think about the units.

The scalar potential V has units of volts. Let's check option C.

V is [qc]/([ε0][d c - v·d})

Wait, ε0 has units of C²/(N·m²), and d is meters. So let's see:

V's numerator is q c, where q is Coulombs, c is
