Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The problem is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. There are four options given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. So the first thing I remember is that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider their neutralization. Acids donate H+ ions, and bases donate OH- ions. The H+ and OH- will react to form water. The excess will determine the pH of the solution.

Wait, but wait. There are three solutions here. Two are acids (acetic acid and HCl) and one is a base (barium hydroxide). So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

I think the steps I should take are:

1. Calculate the moles of H+ from each acid solution.
2. Calculate the moles of OH- from the base solution.
3. Determine which is in excess: H+ or OH-.
4. Find out how much of the excess remains after neutralization.
5. Calculate the concentration of the excess in the total solution volume.
6. Use that concentration to find the pH, either by using the formula for strong or weak acids/bases.

Let me go through each step.

First, calculating the moles of H+ from the acids.

Starting with CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, but for the purpose of calculating H+ contribution, I think I should consider that it partially dissociates. Wait, but wait—no, wait. When mixing with a strong base, maybe I should treat it as a strong acid? Or no, because in solution it only donates some H+.

Wait, no. Let me think. Actually, when you add a weak acid and a strong base, the weak acid's H+ will react with the OH- from the base. But wait, in this case, I have multiple acids and a base. So all the H+ from the acids (both strong and weak) will react with the OH- from the base.

Wait, but wait—HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. So for HCl, the moles of H+ are straightforward. For CH3COOH, it's trickier.

Wait, but when you mix all together, the CH3COOH will be in solution with excess OH- from Ba(OH)2. So, perhaps the OH- will deprotonate the CH3COOH. But I'm not sure if I should account for that because it's a weak acid.

Alternatively, maybe I should first calculate the total H+ from all acids and the total OH- from the base, then see if there's excess H+ or OH-.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely, providing OH- ions. So for Ba(OH)2, each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions.

Let me compute the moles:

First, for each solution:

1. CH3COOH:
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Concentration = 0.1 M
Moles of CH3COOH = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol.

But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully release H+. However, when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to consider all H+ from HCl and the weak acid's H+ as available, then subtract OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but that's not correct because the weak acid doesn't fully dissociate. So, perhaps I should compute the total H+ available from the acids, but for the weak acid, we only consider the H+ that reacts with OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the strong acid (HCl), and any remaining OH- will then neutralize the weak acid.

Wait, that makes sense. Strong acids dissociate completely, so their H+ is fully available. Weak acids don't, so their H+ contribution is considered only when the solution is acidic. But in this case, when mixed with a base, perhaps the OH- will neutralize the available H+.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: since it's strong, all contributes.

Moles HCl = 0.4 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol. Since HCl is 1:1 with H+, moles H+ from HCl = 0.08.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from CH3COOH: since it's weak, but in solution with OH-, perhaps the OH- will deprotonate some of it. But wait, perhaps for the purpose of this neutralization, we can consider that all the H+ from CH3COOH can potentially contribute, but only to the extent that the OH- allows.

Wait, no. Another approach is, regardless of the strength, the H+ available is the concentration of H+ in solution. For weak acids, that's [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C). But when mixing with a base, perhaps the H+ from the acid reacts with OH-. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed as:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: let's compute that.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol.

So moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Similarly, the H+ from CH3COOH: since it's a weak acid, in pure solution, it doesn't release all H+. But when OH- is present, the OH- can deprotonate the CH3COOH.

Wait, but perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH can be considered as a weak source. So, when you mix all the solutions, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first react with the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release H+ readily. So perhaps the reaction stops when all the OH- is used up, with some H+ left from HCl and CH3COOH.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the total H+ from all acids and the total OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so all of its H+ is available. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so only a small amount of H+ is available unless it's in a solution where it's not neutralized.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps more clearly.

First, calculate moles of H+ from HCl.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol HCl → 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all the H+. So in pure solution, [H+] is sqrt(Ka * C). Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8e-5. So [H+] would be sqrt(1.8e-5 * 0.1) = sqrt(1.8e-6) = approx 0.00134 M.

But when we mix it with a strong base, the OH- will react with any available H+.

Wait, but perhaps I should forget about the weak acid's dissociation and just treat all H+ from the acids as available, considering that the OH- will neutralize them.

Wait, no. Because the H+ from CH3COOH is not as readily available as from HCl. So perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the HCl's H+, and any remaining OH- will neutralize some of the CH3COOH, but since it's weak, only the available H+ (which may be much less than the CH3COOH's potential) will be neutralized.

Hmm, maybe I should compute the total H+ available from all acids and the total OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Wait, but in reality, the H+ from CH3COOH is less than its moles because it's a weak acid. So perhaps a better approach is:

Total H+ available = H+ from HCl + H+ from CH3COOH.

But without knowing the exact H+ concentration from CH3COOH, I can't directly calculate the exact amount. Maybe I need to consider the reaction between the OH- and the H+ from the acids.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid.

So let's proceed step by step.

Compute moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now, the OH- will react with H+ from HCl first.

So, moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol.

Reaction: OH- + H+ → H2O.

So, 0.08 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH- will react, neutralizing each other. The OH- left after this reaction is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

So now, the OH- is in excess by 0.10 mol.

Next, the excess OH- will react with the CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ when OH- is present.

The reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O.

The moles of OH- left are 0.10 mol. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 mol.

So, OH- will react with CH3COOH. The OH- (0.10 mol) will try to deprotonate all the CH3COOH (0.05 mol).

So, moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

So, all CH3COOH will react with OH- (since OH- is in excess). So, moles of OH- remaining after this reaction: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So now, we have 0.05 mol of OH- left.

Wait, but wait. Because when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, each mole of CH3COOH consumes one mole of OH-.

So, CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, OH- is 0.10 mol. After reaction:

CH3COOH is all consumed (since 0.05 < 0.10), and OH- remaining is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So now, the total solution will have 0.05 mol of OH-.

The total volume of the solution is the sum of all the volumes: 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH is -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

So, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean the solution is basic, with pH around 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, why isn't the CH3COOH contributing any H+? Because all of its H+ was neutralized by the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the OH- is in excess, making the solution basic, so the pH would be based on the excess OH-.

Wait, that calculation seems to lead to an OH- concentration of 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M. So pOH is around 1.38, so pH is 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the presence of a weak acid might affect the solution. But in this case, since all the OH- has neutralized all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and there's still excess OH-, the solution should be basic, so pH>7.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62, which fits.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08.

OH-: 0.18.

H+ and OH- react 1:1, so after reaction: 0.08 H+ used, 0.08 OH- used. Remaining OH-: 0.18 -0.08= 0.10.

Then, CH3COOH: 0.05 mol. Each CH3COOH can donate 1 H+ (if available). But since OH- is present, this H+ will be taken by OH-.

So, OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 mol OH- used, leaving 0.10 - 0.05=0.05 mol OH-.

Total volume is 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05/1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = log(1/(0.04167)) → wait, no, pOH is -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH=14-1.38=12.62. So option A.

Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, another thought: when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it forms the acetate ion and water. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, perhaps its dissociation would be affected, but in this case, since all of it is deprotonated (since OH- is in excess), the solution is just based on the excess OH-.

So, I think the correct pH is 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H⁺ from HCl} = 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, and each formula unit provides 2 OH⁻ ions.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Moles of OH⁻} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻**:  
   The OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ reacts with the H⁺ from HCl in a 1:1 ratio.  
   - Moles of H⁺ available: \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Moles of OH⁻ available: \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - After neutralization:  
     \[
     \text{Remaining OH⁻} = 0.18 \, \text{mol} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol}.
     \]

4. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of excess OH⁻, it donates its H⁺ to neutralize the OH⁻.  
   - Moles of CH₃COOH:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
   - OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio:  
     \[
     \text{Remaining OH⁻} = 0.10 \, \text{mol} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
     \]

5. **Calculate the concentration of OH⁻ in the final solution**:  
   The total volume of the solution is:  
   \[
   500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
   \]  
   \[
   [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Calculate pOH and pH**:  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
   \]

The solution is basic due to the excess OH⁻, and the pH is approximately **12.62**.

**Answer: A**
