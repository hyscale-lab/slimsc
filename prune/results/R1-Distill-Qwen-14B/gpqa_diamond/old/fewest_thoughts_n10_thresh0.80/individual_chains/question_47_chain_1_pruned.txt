Okay, so I've got this question here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me jot down the given data. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually indicative of N-H stretches. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which I remember is around where carbonyl groups (like amides or esters) show up. So the compound probably has an amide or an ester group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, likely a CH3 group attached to something with two protons, maybe a CH2. So perhaps an ethyl group, like CH2CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe it's the end of an ethyl group attached to something else.
  
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet, integrating for two protons. Broad signals can sometimes be from exchangeable protons, but wait, the IR had N-H stretches, so maybe this is an amine or an amide. But wait, in NMR, if it's an amide, the NH protons usually show up around 8-10 ppm as broad signals. Or maybe these protons are part of an OCH2 group? Like in an ester's ethyl group, the OCH2 would be around 4 ppm. The 'bs' might indicate that it's not split because of exchange or slow relaxation. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet, integrating for two protons. Quartet means each proton is coupling with three others, so maybe adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but two protons as a quartet? Hmm. Let me think. If it's a -OCH2CO- structure, like an ester, the OCH2 would be next to the carbonyl. The quartet could be from a neighboring CH2 group. For example, in ethyl esters, the OCH2 is split by the adjacent CH2CH3. Wait, the ethyl group's CH2 would be a quartet. So perhaps this is the OCH2 in an ester, next to a CH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2, and the triplet at 1.2 ppm would be the CH2CH3.

- Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating for two protons. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like a substituent on the benzene ring at the para position. So the ring has two substituents across from each other. Each doublet indicates coupling with one neighboring proton, which is typical for para substituents in a benzene ring.

Putting this together, I think the structure might be an ethyl ester or an ethyl amide attached to a benzene ring. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide suggests a CONH2 group attached to benzene. But wait, the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: benzamide is C7H7NO2. If it's 3-ethoxy, adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would make it C9H11NO2. So the formula matches. But wait, in the NMR, the aromatic would be different. For a 3-ethoxybenzamide, the substituents are ethoxy and amide. The benzene would have ethoxy at position 3 and amide at position 1. Wait, but the aromatic protons would be meta. So the coupling would be different. The two doublets might not be as clear, maybe. Alternatively, maybe for para substitution, the coupling would be as observed. Hmm, maybe not.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH-. So the structure would be O=C(NH) attached to a benzene with an ethoxy group in the para position. The formula would be C9H11NO2 as well. Let's think about the NMR. The ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would show up as triplet at 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 would be around 4.0 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the OCH2 would be split differently. So maybe this isn't the right fit.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would be something like CH2CH2COO- attached to benzene. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzene (C6H5) + NH2 (from 4-aminophenyl) + CH2CH2COO-. Hmm, wait, the amine is NH2, which is a substituent on the benzene. The propionate ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? Or maybe it's ethyl propionate? Wait, no. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the amide or ester. Wait, propionate as an ester would be something like R-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CO-O- attached to the benzene, along with an amino group. Let me think about the NMR.

The 1.20 ppm triplet would be the CH2CH2 group from the propionate. Wait, but if it's a propionate ester, the ethyl group would be part of the ester. Wait, maybe not. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think of the structure. If it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, then it's OCO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, along with an NH2 group. But then, in the NMR, the OCH2 would appear as a triplet or quartet. I'm not sure if this fits the given NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure would be ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's break it down. Benzoate is C7H5O2- plus ethyl (C2H5) makes C9H10O2. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, so that's one more hydrogen. Wait, maybe because of the amine group. Benzoate would be COOEt (ethyl). The benzene ring has an amino group in para position.

So, the structure would be O
           ||
O-C-O-Et
attached to benzene, which also has NH2 in para position.

Wait, but wait, the molecular formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ethyl ester would be C9H10O2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So, adding an amino group would bring in one N and an extra H. Let me count: C7 (from benzoate) + C2 (ethyl) = C9. O2 from the ester. The amino group is NH2, so the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Yes, that fits.

Now, let's think about the NMR.

The ethyl group would have the CH2CH3 as triplet at 1.2 ppm (t, 3H). The OCH2 from the ester would be a quartet because it's adjacent to the CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be at around 4.5 ppm as a quartet (q, 2H). That matches the given data.

The aromatic region: the benzene ring has two substituents: NH2 and COOEt in para positions. So the ring would have two doublets each integrating for two protons. The coupling would be between the two sets of protons, which would give two doublets. The protons ortho to the substituents would be deshielded, so higher ppm.

Wait, in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That makes sense if the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups. The COOEt is an electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. The amino group is a strong activating group, but in the para position, so the adjacent protons would be shielded or deshielded? Wait, the amino group is a strong activating, para-directing group. So, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, but wait, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents would be at positions 4 and 1? No, wait, benzoate is at position 1, NH2 at position 4.

Wait, no, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is where the benzoate ester is attached to the benzene ring at position 1, and the amino group is at position 4. So, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, which are para to each other.

In that case, the aromatic protons would have two sets: the protons adjacent to the amino group (positions 2 and 6) would be more shielded, maybe around 7 ppm, and the protons adjacent to the ester group (positions 3 and 5) would be more deshielded, around 8 ppm. So that matches the NMR data: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H), each a doublet.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are 7.0 and 8.0 as doublets. That matches the expectations for para-substituted benzoate with an amino group.

Now, looking at the NMR signals again: the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) would be the OCH2 from the ester. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) is a bit confusing. Wait, in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the OCH2 should be the quartet. Oh wait, maybe I got the assignments wrong. Let me think again.

In an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be next to the carbonyl, and the CH2CH3 is attached to the O. So the OCH2 would be adjacent to the CH2CH3, so their protons would couple. So the OCH2 would be a quartet because each H is next to a CH2 with two H
