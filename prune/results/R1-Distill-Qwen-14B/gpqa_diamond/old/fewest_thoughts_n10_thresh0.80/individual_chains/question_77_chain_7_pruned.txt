Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. Right, when you heat or expose them to light, they undergo a rearrangement where the double bonds shift positions. I think it's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. So the molecule kind of shifts, and the substituents end up in different positions.

Looking at the first part of the question, the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure mentally. So it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's an oxygen connected to a CH2 group. The but-2-en-1-yl group is attached to the oxygen. So the structure is like benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl: So but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2CHCHCH2, but with the double bond at position 2. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let's see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- group. Wait, but with the substituents. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be: the chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- but wait, no. Let me think again: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the 1-yl means the substituent is attached to the first carbon of the butenyl group. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. Wait, but the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy, so it's OCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, but-2
