Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Let's see what information I have.

First, the compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. I think this is a complex molecule with multiple double bonds and methyl groups. I'll need to determine the structure to figure out how many bonds I'm dealing with.

The problem provides some bond energies:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element and form separate atoms. For carbon, this would be the energy to break a C-C bond into two C atoms. So, if that's 1000 kJ/mol, then the bond energy for C-C is 1000 kJ per mole. Wait, but wait, the problem also gives a bond energy for C-C as 200 kJ/mol. That's confusing. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read again.

Oh, maybe the first line is the enthalpy of atomization for carbon, which is different. So, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert one mole of an element into its constituent atoms in the gas phase. For carbon, C atoms in the solid, liquid, or gas form. So, the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So, that's the energy to break a C-C bond into two C atoms. So, the bond energy for C-C would be half of that? Because each bond is shared between two atoms. So, if breaking a C-C bond into two C atoms requires 1000 kJ/mol, then each C-C bond has a bond energy of 1000 / 2 = 500 kJ/mol? Wait, but the problem states that the bond energy of C-C is 200 kJ/mol. Oh wait, maybe the question is inconsistent. Because in the problem, the bond energies given are C-C=200, C=C=300, etc. So, perhaps the first value is the enthalpy of atomization, which is different from the bond energy.
