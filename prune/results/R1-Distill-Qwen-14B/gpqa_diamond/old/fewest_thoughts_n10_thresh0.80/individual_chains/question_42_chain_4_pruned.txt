Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to remember.

First, the question mentions the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I don't think that's directly relevant to solving this problem because the question is more about orbital periods and temperatures. So maybe I can set that aside for now.

The problem gives me ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets and the ratios of their masses. The albedo for all three is the same, 0.3. I remember that equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star because it's based on the energy balance. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). But wait, I'm probably mixing up some terms. Let me think.

Oh right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is the albedo. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

The problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3, so T2/T3 = 2.3.

Wait, no, wait. If the ratio of T between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, does that mean T1 is 1.4 times T2, or T2 is 1.4 times T1? The wording says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So I think it's T1/T2 = 1.4. Or perhaps it's the other way around? Hmm, I need to be careful. Let's check the wording again: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So it's (T_planet1) / (T_planet2) = 1.4. So T1 is higher than T2. That would imply that Planet1 is closer to the star because higher temperature means closer orbit.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3, meaning T2 is higher than T3. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet3.

So the order of the planets in terms of distance from the star would be Planet1, Planet2, Planet3, with Planet3 being the farthest.

Now, how do I relate the equilibrium temperatures to the orbital period? I remember that Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis (a) and the mass of the star (M_star). The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G M_star) * a^3. But wait, in this problem, the masses given are the planet masses, not the star's. Hmm, but in Kepler's law, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, so M in the formula is the mass of the star. So the planet's mass doesn't directly affect the orbital period, unless it's a very massive planet, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the ratios of the masses between the planets. Planet1/Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is 15% more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is 35% more massive than Planet3. So the masses are increasing from 3 to 2 to 1
