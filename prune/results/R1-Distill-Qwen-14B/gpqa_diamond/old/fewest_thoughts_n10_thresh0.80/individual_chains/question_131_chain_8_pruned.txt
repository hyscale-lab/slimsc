Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. First, let's read the question carefully.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR characteristics: a single peak in the 1H NMR at 7 ppm and two peaks in the 13C NMR at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and a minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The key part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. The question is asking which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, it becomes an anhydride. The NMR data for the anhydride is important. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. What does that suggest? Well, 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons show up. But wait, this is an anhydride. Maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated system with some aromatic-like protons.

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbon chemical shifts: 137 is in the range for carbons adjacent to double bonds, maybe sp² carbons. 165 is probably a carbonyl carbon, like from an anhydride group. So the anhydride has a structure that includes a carbonyl (like the O=C-O-C=O) and perhaps some conjugated double bonds.

Wait, the 1H NMR is a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe it's a symmetrical structure. If the anhydride is cyclic, like a cyclic di-acid anhydride, perhaps the protons in the ring are equivalent, giving a singlet. Or maybe it's a lactide-like structure? Or perhaps the double bond is in a certain configuration that makes the protons equivalent.

Wait, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, that becomes a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. If the starting alkene is cis, the anhydride will have a cis double bond as well. So that could lead to symmetry, making the protons on the double bond equivalent. For example, in a cyclic structure, maybe the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons, making the ring symmetrical.

So perhaps the anhydride is a five-membered ring, like a maleic anhydride derivative
