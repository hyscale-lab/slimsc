Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the product of a Cope rearrangement reaction. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the Cope rearrangement is all about. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. The reaction forms a new six-membered ring, right?

The compound given here is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Okay, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it's a norbornene structure. The numbering might help. Let's break it down.

Norbornene has two rings: a five-membered ring and a six-membered ring, but wait, no, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridges. The structure is like two rings connected by three bridges: two of length two carbons and one of length one. So the molecule is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene with a substituent at position 2 which is a vinyl group attached to an azabicyclo structure.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo... So the nitrogen is at position 2, and there's a vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-) also attached at position 2. So the structure has a bridge with two carbons, another bridge with two carbons, and a bridge with one carbon. The double bond is at position 5, so that's in one of the rings.

Now, for the Cope rearrangement, I think we need a 1,5-diene. So I should look for conjugated double bonds separated by three single bonds. Wait, but in this compound, the double bond is in the bicyclic system. Let me imagine the structure.

The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have the double bond between carbons 5 and 6 perhaps. And the substituents are at position 2, which is the bridgehead. So the structure would have a bridge with a nitrogen and a vinyl group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, looking for the diene
