Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this genetics question. Let's start by understanding what's being asked here. 

So, the setup is about white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They've created knockout mutants for each and also some double mutants. The goal is to determine the interactions among these genes based on the resistance levels shown by the mutants.

The results are given as percentages of resistance compared to the wild-type control. Wild-type is 100%, so any mutants with lower percentages are more susceptible. 

Let me list out the data:

- g1 (G1 knockout): 75% → less resistant than wild type but not extremely so.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So, no resistance at all.
- g3: 50% → halfway between wild type and susceptible.
- Double mutants:
   - g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.
   - g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
   - g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. Also, the question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, one of them is regulating others. 

I remember that in genetic studies, when a double mutant doesn't show a more severe phenotype than one of the single mutants, it suggests that the two genes function in the same pathway. If the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it implies that gene is downstream. 

Looking at the results, let's see the single mutants first. 

- g2 has 0% resistance, which means it's completely susceptible. So, G2's knockout leads to no resistance. So G2 is somehow critical for resistance. 

Looking at the double mutants involving g2:
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

So, when you have a double mutant of g2 with any other gene, it's as bad as just having g2 knocked out. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. Because if you knock out both G2 and G1, the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. So, G2 might be a transcription factor regulating G1 and/or G3.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out alone, the resistance is 0%, which is the worst. 

What about the other single mutants: g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So, without G1, there's partial loss of resistance. Without G3, more loss.

Now, let's think about the double mutant g1g3, which has 10% resistance. That's much lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops much more. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be acting in parallel pathways. Or perhaps they have additive effects. Because when you knock both out, the effect is stronger than either alone. 

Wait, but if two genes are in the same pathway, and one is upstream, then knocking both would have the same effect as knocking the downstream gene. So in that case, the double mutant wouldn't be worse than the single. But in this case, the double mutant g1g3 is worse, which suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Or perhaps they are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other.

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So, if you knock out one, the other can compensate. But when you knock out both, the phenotype is worse. 

So for example, if G1 and G3 are redundant
