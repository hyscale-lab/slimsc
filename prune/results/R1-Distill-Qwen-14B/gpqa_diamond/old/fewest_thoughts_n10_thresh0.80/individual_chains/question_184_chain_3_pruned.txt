Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, each presenting a sequence of reactions, and I need to pick the correct one that leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, let me try to visualize the target molecule. The substituents on the benzene ring are: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. So the numbering would be such that the substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 4 relative to each other? Wait, no. Wait, the benzene ring is a six-membered ring, and the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So numbering starts with the ethoxy at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So the substituents are adjacent in a 1,2,3 sequence around the ring.

Now, I need to think about the order of reactions to introduce these substituents. The key here is the order because the directing effects of substituents will determine where the next group goes.

I remember that nitro groups are meta-directing, and ethoxy groups are ortho/para-directing. Tert-butyl is a bulky group, but it's an alkyl group, which is ortho/para-directing. However, since it's a bulky substituent, it might favor para more than ortho due to steric hindrance.

But wait, in this case, the substituents are arranged at positions 1, 2, and 3. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's think about the possible steps.

The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So we're probably going to add these groups in some order. The order is crucial because each substitution affects where the next will go.

Let me consider the possible order of substitution.

One approach is to determine the order in which the substituents are added based on their directing effects. But wait, benzene is the starting material, which is symmetric, so the first substituent will determine the positions of the others.

Let me think: Which substituent is added first? Let's consider the possibilities.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first.

Alkylation of benzene using, say, tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 as a catalyst. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group. So after adding the tert-butyl group, the next substitution would be directed by that group.

Then, the next substituent would be either nitro or ethoxy. But nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. If we add nitro next, it will direct the next substituent to meta with respect to it
