Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass: Star_1 is 1.5 times the Sun's mass, and Star_2 is 1.2 times. The question gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. I remember EW stands for Equivalent Width, which is related to the abundance of an element in a star's spectrum.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how to use the [X/Y] notation. Oh right, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to the Sun.

The question wants the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I'm looking for (n_Si1 / n_Si2), I think.

Let me think about each star one by one.

Starting with Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as the Sun. So, [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 0.

Which implies that log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

From the Sun's data, nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5), because 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → 10^-4.5.

So nFe1/nH1 = 10^-4.5.

Next, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, [Si/Fe] is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

Wait no, wait. The definition is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, [Si/Fe]_1 is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

We can rearrange this.

Let me denote log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But I need to find nSi1 in terms of H. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's solve for nSi1.

nSi1/nFe1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun)

Because [X/Y] = log (nX/nY) - log (nX/nY)_sun = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) ) → so nX/nY = 10^{[X/Y]} * (nX_sun/nY_sun).

So for Star_1:

nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

We know nFe1/nH1 is the same as the Sun's nFe/nH, which is 10^-4.5.

So nFe1 = 10^-4.5 * nH1.

Wait, but in the Sun, nFe_sun = 10^-4.5 * nH_sun.

So, let's compute nSi1 in terms of nH1.

nSi1 = (nFe1/nH1) * (nSi1/nFe1) ) * nH1.

Wait, no. Let me think:

nSi1 = (nSi1/nFe1) * nFe1.

But nFe1 = (nFe1/nH1) * nH1.

So,

nSi1 = (nSi1/nFe1) * (nFe1/nH1) * nH1.

But nH1 is the number of hydrogen atoms. Wait, but I'm looking for the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2, so maybe it's easier to find nSi1/nH1 and nSi2/nH2, then take their ratio.

So nSi1/nH1 = (nSi1/nFe1) * (nFe1/nH1).

We have nFe1/nH1 = 10^-4.5.

And (nSi1/nFe1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun
