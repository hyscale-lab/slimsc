Okay, so I've got this problem about a synchrocyclotron and a proton moving through it. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. But wait, what's the main difference again? Oh right, cyclotrons have a fixed magnetic field, while synchrocyclotrons vary the magnetic field to keep the particles in phase with the electric field as their velocity increases. But wait, wait, in this problem, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so T ≈ 0. The proton is accelerated twice to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Interesting.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas here. Let me think. I remember that the time for each revolution in a cyclotron is related to the frequency of the electric field. For a cyclotron, the frequency is related to the magnetic field strength. But since this is a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field changes over time. Or wait, does it? Maybe the key is to use the concept of the radial equation.

Wait, the voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So the frequency ν depends on α, which I'm not exactly sure about. Oh wait, α might be the particle's momentum or some other parameter. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps α is a function of the velocity or the radius. I'm a bit confused here.

The initial kinetic energy T is zero, so the proton starts from rest. But wait, protons can't have zero velocity if they are in an accelerator because they won't experience any acceleration. Oh, but the problem states that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so maybe it's just starting and the acceleration is applied.

The proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Hmm, perhaps each acceleration corresponds to a certain number of revolutions. Or maybe the total number of revolutions is determined by the time taken to reach that energy. Since each revolution takes a certain time, the total number would be the total time divided by the period per revolution.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the time per revolution is given by T = (2π m)/(qB), right? But here, the magnetic field isn't constant because it's a synchrocyclotron. So the frequency changes as the proton's momentum increases. Oh, but wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field decreases as the particles gain energy to keep the cyclotron frequency constant. So the frequency ν of the electric field is equal to the cyclotron frequency, which is (qB)/(2πm). But since B is changing, the frequency also changes? Or wait, no—maybe in synchrocyclotrons, the frequency is adjusted so that the electric field is in phase with the particles' motion, even as their velocity increases. So the frequency ν(α) is a function that varies over time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler and treats the synchrocyclotron as a machine where the number of revolutions is related to the energy gained through the voltage.

Wait, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos
