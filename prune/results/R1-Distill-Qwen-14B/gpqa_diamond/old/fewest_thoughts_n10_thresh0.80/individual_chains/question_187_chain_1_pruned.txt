Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Hmm, okay, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's known for high-resolution spectroscopy, right? So its main purpose is to study the spectra of stars in great detail. But the question is about whether the stars listed can be detected with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

The question lists six stars (a to f), and I need to determine how many are detectable. The options given are A) 2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

Let me think about each star. I remember that the detectability depends on the brightness of the star. The brighter the star, the higher the S/N, which increases with exposure time and the telescope's collecting area. Since all the stars are observed with the same telescope and instrument, the main factor here is their apparent brightness as seen from Earth.

Apparent magnitude plays a big role. So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude (m) for each star, given their absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d). The formula for that is m = M + 5 log10(d) + 5, where d is in parsecs.

Wait, let me get that right. The distance modulus formula is m - M = 5 log10(d) - 5. So m = M + 5 log10(d/10). Or wait, maybe I should be precise. Let's see: yes, the formula is m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1), which simplifies to m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, no, let me look that up mentally. The formula is: m = M + 5 log10 (d/10 pc). So that's m = M +5 (log10(d) - 1) â†’ m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

Right, that's correct.

So for each star, I can calculate m as m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

Each of the stars a to f has M=15, except a and b, which are Canopus and Polaris. Wait, I think I need to look up the absolute magnitudes of Canopus and Polaris.

Wait, Canopus is a bright star. I think Canopus is one of the brightest stars in the sky. Polaris is also quite bright, being the North Star. But I'm not sure of their absolute magnitudes. Alternatively, maybe I can find their apparent magnitudes and then relate them.

Wait, but in the options given, a and b are specific stars, so I need to find their apparent magnitudes. The others (c, d, e, f) have M=1
