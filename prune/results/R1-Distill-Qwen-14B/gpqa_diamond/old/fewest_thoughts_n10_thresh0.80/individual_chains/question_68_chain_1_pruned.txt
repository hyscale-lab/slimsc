Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. It's about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm. So I need to find what this frequency is. The options are given in terms of gamma, B, and some square roots.

Let me think about what happens when the magnetic field changes. When the field is along Z, the particle's spin is quantized along Z. The magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz. So Sz is the spin component in the Z direction, which for a spin-1/2 particle can be ± ħ/2 times some factor? Wait, maybe I should recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S has components Sx, Sy, Sz, each of which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Oh wait, no, actually the eigenvalues of S are ± ħ/2 multiplied by something? Or is it that the spin matrices are proportional to Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps I should start by recalling the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field. The energy is given by the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So H = -mu · B. Oh wait, actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, right? So H = -gamma * S · B.

Wait, no, the standard form is H = -mu · B, where mu is the magnetic moment. So if the magnetic field is along Z, then H = -gamma * B * Sz. So the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the Sz basis. The energy levels are then E = -gamma B (sz), where sz is ± 1/2 (since Sz has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but perhaps I should set ħ=1 here for simplicity).

Wait, maybe the units are such that ħ is 1. So Sz eigenvalues are ± 1/2. So when the magnetic field is along Z, the particle has energies
