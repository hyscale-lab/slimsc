Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the reaction between a saturated epoxide and an organocuprate reagent, specifically Me₂CuLi. The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I remember that when epoxides react with organocuprates, the reagent adds the alkyl group to the less hindered carbon. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile (Nu) attacks.

Wait, let me think about this. Epoxides are strained rings, and when nucleophiles attack, they typically open the ring. Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and will add twice to the epoxide, right? Because they're Grignard-like reagents, but with a cuprate. So, the first attack would open the epoxide, and the second would add another group, but wait, no: organocuprates usually add twice because they're strong enough to do both steps in one go. Or wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition? No, in epoxide reactions, it's typically a two-step process where each oxygen gets an addition.

Wait, no, I think I'm a bit confused. Let me recap. When an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile, the first step is the attack at the less hindered carbon, opening the epoxide. Then the conjugate base forms, and then another nucleophile can attack. But organocuprates, being strong, can do both in one addition, leading to a diol.

Wait, but no, in the case of epoxides, the organocuprate (like Me₂CuLi) would add the methyl group to the less hindered carbon. Wait, the question says the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So the first attack is at the less substituted carbon, then the second attack is at the more substituted? Or not?

Wait, the reaction of epoxides with organocuprates is typically a conjugate addition, similar to the opening with Grignard reagents. So, the cuprate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the less substituted (less hindered) carbon of the epoxide. Then, the ring opens, and the second equivalent adds to the adjacent carbon, but wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, the organocuprate adds twice in a conjugate fashion. So, the epoxide oxygen becomes part of a larger ring after opening. Hmm, no, perhaps I should draw the structure.

The starting compound is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So, the bicyclo system is [4.1.0], which means there are bridges connecting the carbons. Let me visualize it. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have two rings: a four-membered ring and a one-membered? Wait, no, wait, bicyclo[m.n.p] means the bridge sizes. So for [4.1.0], the bridges are 4, 1,
