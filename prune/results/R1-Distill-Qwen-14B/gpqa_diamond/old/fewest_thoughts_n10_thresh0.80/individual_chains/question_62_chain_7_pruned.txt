Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me try to break this down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me draw it mentally. So, there's a cyclohexane ring. Attached to one of its carbons is a cyclohexyl group (since it's cyclohexyl), and a hydroxymethyl group. Also, there's an aldehyde group somewhere. Wait, wait, the formula might help. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group on the same carbon as the aldehyde? Or is it on another carbon?

Wait, no, the numbering might be key here. 1 refers to the position of the substituent. So the ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxymethyl attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the cyclohexane ring. And the cyclohexane also has a carbonyl group as an aldehyde. Hmm, maybe I should think about the steps to build this from ethynylcyclohexane.

Ethyne is triple bond between two carbons. Ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡C-) attached. So, the starting material is probably cyclohexane with a triple bond to a methyl group or something? Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a vinyl group that's a triple bond, like CH2-C≡CH attached? Maybe not, perhaps it's cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH2 group. Not sure, but I'll proceed.

The target has a cyclohexyl group, which suggests that maybe some sort of ring expansion or substitution happened. Also, there's a hydroxym
