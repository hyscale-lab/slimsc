Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to wrap my head around pericyclic reactions like sigmatropic rearrangements. Let me take a deep breath and think through each of these reactions step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions 1, 2, and 3, each leading to products A, B, and C respectively. The options are given, so I need to figure out which option correctly assigns A, B, C.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form A. Hmm, I remember that when you have an enol and something that can form an oxonium ion, like a dienol, you might get a Claisen-like rearrangement. Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure is like ethylamine where both hydrogens on the nitrogen are substituted with methoxy groups. So, it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? No, wait, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be NH(CH2OCH3)2. So the nitrogen is attached to two CH2OCH3 groups and a hydrogen? Or wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, so 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on the same carbon as the amine. So it's (CH2OCH3)2NH. Oh wait, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, so 1,1-dimethoxy would be CH2(OCH3)2NH. So that's a structure where the amine is attached to a carbon that's connected to two methoxy groups. 

Then, reacting with but-3-en-2-ol. The but-3-en-2-ol structure is (CH2)2CHOH. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is
