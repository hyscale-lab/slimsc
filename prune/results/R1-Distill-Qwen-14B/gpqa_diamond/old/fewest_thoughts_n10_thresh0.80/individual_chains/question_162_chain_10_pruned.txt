Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh wait, no, actually, in relativity, the metric is usually written in terms of dx^2, dy^2, etc., but sometimes with more variables. Wait, this looks like a 2D metric, so maybe it's a 2D space? Or perhaps part of a higher-dimensional space?

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere's metric would typically be something involving sinh or cosh terms, like ds² = dr² + (a² cosh(r/a))² dθ², where a is the radius. But here, the given metric is different.

Wait, the metric here is written in terms of x and y, but maybe it's a different coordinate system. Let me think: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the denominator must be positive, because that's under the 32 in the numerator. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 implies that x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in
