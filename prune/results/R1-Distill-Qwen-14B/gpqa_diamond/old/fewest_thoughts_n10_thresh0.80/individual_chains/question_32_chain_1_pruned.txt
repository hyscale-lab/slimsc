Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the RHIC when the nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. Let me think about the isotopes. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So X is a Li-6 nucleus.

The question is about relativistic energy. I remember that when an object moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you need to use relativistic equations. The energy here is probably the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

The formula for total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. And gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.96)^2. Let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96. Hmm, 0.9^2 is 0.81, 0.06^2 is 0.0036, and the cross terms are 2 * 0.9 * 0.06 = 0.108. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, 0.96^2 can be calculated as (1 - 0.04)^2 = 1 - 0.08 + 0.0016 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.0784 is 0.28 squared. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's see, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So yes, the denominator is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Since Li-6
