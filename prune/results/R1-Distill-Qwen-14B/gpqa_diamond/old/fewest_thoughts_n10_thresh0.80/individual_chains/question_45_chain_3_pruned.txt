Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking about the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies of the system. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one. The potential well has length L, and each particle is spin-1/2, so that probably affects the possible quantum states because of the Pauli exclusion principle.

Wait, each particle is a fermion, right? Because spin-1/2 particles are fermions. So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, but since they're in a 1D well, their quantum state is determined by their quantum number n and their spin.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh, and the problem defines E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so that E_n = n² E. That's helpful.

So the ground state is the lowest energy state possible. For four particles, we need to place each in the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli principle. Since each particle has spin up or down, each level can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, the spin part: each n level can have two particles, one with spin +1/2 and the other -1/2. So in the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels with as many particles as possible, each in a unique state.

Let me think about how to fill the levels. For four particles, we can start by filling the lowest levels.

Ground state: We have four particles. The lowest n is 1. Each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So n=1 can hold 2, n=2 holds 2 more. Wait, but four is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2 (opposite spins each).

Wait, but wait. For n=1, it's two particles, then n=2: another two. So the energies would be n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Or wait, no, each particle's energy is n² E. So four particles, two with n=1 and two with n=2. So sum would be 2*1² E + 2*2² E = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? Or wait, no, wait. Because each particle is in a unique state, but for the ground state, perhaps the lowest possible arrangement is all four particles in the lowest possible n's.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each particle can have a unique state, but each state is determined by (n, spin). So the first two particles go into n=1, one spin up, one spin down. The next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So yes, the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E. Wait, but wait, for four particles, that's correct. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But looking at the options, option C says ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E. Option B has ground state 4E, first 10, second 50. Hmm, maybe I messed up.

Wait wait wait. No,
