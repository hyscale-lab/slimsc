Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

The question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Right, meta means they are three positions apart. So if I imagine the ring, each of these groups is separated by one carbon each. Wait, noâ€”meta positions are two carbons apart, so positions 1,3,5 would be meta if they're all 120 degrees apart.

Wait, but the problem says all three are meta to one another. So each is meta to the others. That means they form a sort of triangle on the benzene ring. Let me think, the positions would be 1, 3, and 5 perhaps. But I'm not sure; maybe I should draw a rough sketch.

Alternatively, perhaps it's arranged differently. Let me think about the substituents. The carboxylic acid is one, the carbaldehyde is another, and the cyano group is the third. All meta. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde would be at 3, and the cyano at 5, but wait, that can't be because then they wouldn't all be meta to each other. Wait, I think in a benzene ring, each substituent being meta to each other would require that there are three substituents each at 120 degrees, which is
