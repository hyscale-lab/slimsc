Okay, so I've got this problem here about an algorithm that transforms DNA sequences into numbers. I need to figure out what the algorithm is doing and then apply it to the given sequence to find the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the examples given are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Hmm, I wonder how each DNA base is being converted into a number. DNA bases are A, T, C, G. So maybe each base is assigned a numerical value. Let's list out the possibilities.

Wait, what's the numerical value for each base? Maybe they're mapped to 0,1,2,3 or something else. Let me think. Let's see the first example: AGG. Let's break it down.

AGG has three bases: A, G, G. Let's say each has a value, and the algorithm adds them or does something else. So, 115 is the output. Let me calculate 115 divided by 3, since there are three bases. 115 / 3 is approximately 38.333, which doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's the sum of the digits. Or perhaps it's the sum of each base's value multiplied by a position factor.

Alternatively, maybe each base is converted into a number and then summed. Let's assign numbers to each base. Common approaches could be A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. But let's test that.

For AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. Sum is 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe each base is converted to a digit and then concatenated as a number. So A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let's see:

AGG would be 1,4,4 → 144. But the output is 115, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the individual base values multiplied by their positions. So maybe each base's value is multiplied by 2^(n-1), where n is the position from the left (starting at 1). Let's try that.

For AGG:
Positions: 1,2,3.

A=1 → 1 * 2^(3-1) = 1 *4 =4?
Wait, wait. Wait, if the position is from the left, the first base is position 1, so for a 3-letter code, each position would have a weight of 2^(2), 2^(1), 2^(0) → 4, 2,1.

So for AGG: A is first (pos1, weight 4), G is second (pos2, weight 2), G is third (pos3, weight 1
