Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about nuclear decay. Specifically, two heavy nucleons of flavor A decay into two of flavor B, emitting two lighter particles E and V. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the total energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous with an endpoint Q.

Now, there's a variant of this decay where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. The question is asking how the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compares in this new scenario.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in decay processes, the energy distribution of emitted particles depends on the conservation laws, like energy and momentum. Let me think about what factors influence the spectrum.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So four particles are emitted: two E and two V. The E particles have a continuous spectrum, which suggests that their energy isn't fixed. In beta decay, for example, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because its energy depends on the neutron's decay and the conservation of momentum within the nucleus.

Wait, but in beta decay, the neutrino carries away some energy, which allows the electron to have a range of energies. So the maximum energy (endpoint) occurs when the neutrino is at rest (in the center of mass frame), right? So the endpoint Q is determined by the total available energy minus the masses of the products.

Now, in the variant decay, the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So instead of two V particles, it's one M, which is massless. M is exotic, so I'm assuming it's a boson or something, but massless, like a photon perhaps.

Wait, but in the original case, we have two V particles. How would changing that to one M affect the energy of the E particles?

I think the key here is to look at the phase space available for the emitted particles. The continuous spectrum arises when the decay products have varying energies, which depends on their masses and the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original decay:

Each E and V would share the energy released. But since both E and V are emitted, their energies are coupled together. But in the variant, we have two E's and one M. Since M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (E = |p|c for massless particles).

So, in the original decay, the E's and V's have their own energies and momenta. The continuous spectrum for E comes from the fact that as the V's (assuming they have some mass) carry away varying amounts of energy, the E's can have a range of energies.

But in the variant, with M being massless, the situation might change. Let me think: When you have more particles, each with their own energy and momentum, the phase space becomes more complicated. But in the original case, with two V's, perhaps the available energy for E is split in a certain way.

Wait, but in the original decay, the E particles' spectrum is continuous. So when you change the number of emitted particles, how does that affect the E's energy distribution?

If in the variant, instead of two V's, there's one M which is massless, perhaps that affects the possible energies of E. Wait, but M is massless, so it doesn't contribute any rest mass energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of particles emitted affects the degrees of freedom. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In a decay, the initial nucleus (or parent system) has some rest mass, and the decay products must share the energy and momentum.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So four particles
