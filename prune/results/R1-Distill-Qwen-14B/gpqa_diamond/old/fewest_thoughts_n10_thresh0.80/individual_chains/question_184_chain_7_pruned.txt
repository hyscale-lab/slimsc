Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's think about the structure. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, actually, waitâ€”benzene is a ring, so the positions would be 1, 2, and 3 in a row. So substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Wait, let me draw the structure. So benzene ring with substituents: position 1 is ethoxy (OCH2CH3), position 2 is tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and position 3 is nitro (NO2). So the substituents are in a meta arrangement relative to each other, but specifically, they are adjacent in the 1,2,3 positions.

So the product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at 1, 2, 3 positions.

Now, I need to plan the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene. So I'll need to introduce these substituents in a certain order, considering the directing effects of each group.

First, I remember that nitration is a common reaction, but the position where it adds depends on the directing groups present. Similarly, alkylation (like adding the tert-butyl group) and ethoxylation (adding the ethoxy group) will depend on the existing substituents.

In aromatic substitution, activating groups (like -NH2, -OCH3, etc.) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like -NO2, -SO3H, etc.) are meta directors.

But the order of adding substituents is key. If I add a strong deactivating group early on, it can hinder the addition of other groups, making subsequent reactions difficult or leading to low yields.

Let me think about the substituents:

1. tert-butyl group: this is a bulky, strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group) and is a strong ortho/para director. So when adding groups after this, the new substituents will enter ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl.

2. Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3): this is an activating, ortho/para director because it's an electron-donating group.

3. Nitro group (-NO2): a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Once present, it makes the ring less reactive and directs incoming groups to the meta position relative to itself.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 3. So, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl? Or maybe in a different order.
