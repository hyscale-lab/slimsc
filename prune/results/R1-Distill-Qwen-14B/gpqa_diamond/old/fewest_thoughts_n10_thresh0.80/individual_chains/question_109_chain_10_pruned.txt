Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says it's a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Right, parity is a quantum number, and intrinsic parity refers to the parity of the particle itself. So particle X has parity -1.

Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I think that's the Pauli exclusion principle for identical particles. Since nucleons are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. So the product of these parts must be antisymmetric when you swap the two nucleons.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So the isospin quantum number for the two nucleons after emission is 0. Let me think about what that implies for their other quantum numbers.

The emission of a particle X will change the state. So the initial state is 1S0. I need to figure out the possible transitions, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

The problem is about partial waves, which relate to the orbital angular momentum L of the emitted particle. Each option gives a different final state and the type of particle emitted. So I need to check each option for whether the transition is allowed, based on conservation laws.

Wait, the options are of the form 1S0 -> ... So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state after emitting X is something else. So the emitted particle X carries away certain angular momentum, spin, and so on.

But wait, no, in this case, the NN system is emitting a particle X. So the NN system is left in a state with certain quantum numbers, and X has its own. But the problem is about the partial wave of X, which is the angular momentum state it's emitted in. So the options show the final NN state and the type of X.

Wait, looking at the options, they look like initial state -> final state + particle type. For example, option A is 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. So the initial is 1S0, the final NN state is 7D1, and X is a proton (p). So, in each case, the NN go from 1S0 to some state, and emit a particle X.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The initial state is 1S0, so when they emit X, the NN system must transition to another state, and X carries away some quantum numbers.

Wait, but the problem is about the partial wave of X. So X's angular momentum state is l, and the parity of X's state is (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity. Because parity is (intrinsic parity) * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So particle X's parity is (-1)^L * P_intrinsic, where P_in
