Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: We have a system with a Hamiltonian operator H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Sigma is the Pauli vector, which consists of Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Epsilon is an energy constant. The task is to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix, right? And the dot product here would mean sigma · n, so that's sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. So the Hamiltonian H is ε times this sum.

Wait, the eigenvalues of a matrix like this. I think that for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1. But wait, in the case of a combination, like a·σ where a is a vector, the eigenvalues are ±|a|. Because in general, for a vector a, the operator a·σ has eigenvalues ±|a|. Let me think about that. Oh right, because a·σ is a 2x2 matrix, and its trace is zero. The determinant would be (a·σ)^2, which for each Pauli matrix, σ_i squared is identity matrix, so a·σ squared is a·a times identity plus some cross terms? Wait no, more accurately, (a·σ)^2 = (a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this gives a_x² σ_x² + a_y² σ_y² + a_z² σ_z² + terms with σ_i σ_j where i≠j. But σ_i squared is identity, so each of those terms is I. So the sum is (a_x² + a_y² +a_z²) I, which is |a|² I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of a·σ are sqrt(|a|²) and -sqrt(|a|²), which is ±|a|. So if a is a unit vector, then |a|=1, so the eigenvalues are ±1. But in our case, the Hamiltonian is ε times a·σ, where a is the unit vector n.

Wait wait, wait. Let me clarify. The vector n is a unit vector, so |n|=1. So the operator becomes H = ε (n · σ) = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). The eigenvalues of (n · σ) are ±1. So when we multiply by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε.

Wait, but I need to be careful here. Let's think step by step. Let me denote the vector as a = ε n. Wait no, wait, no. Because the Hamiltonian is H = ε (n · σ), and n is a unit vector. So the matrix H is ε times (n · σ). So the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of (n · σ), which are ±1. So that would make the eigenvalues ± ε. So that would correspond to option B: +ε, -ε. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is plus and minus ε, which is what I just calculated. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any factors. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by 1. So if you have a vector n with magnitude 1, then n·σ would have eigenvalues ±1. Multiplying by ε scales those eigenvalues by ε, giving ±ε. So yeah, that should be correct.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The eigenvalues of the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are known to be \( \pm 1 \) because \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues determined by the magnitude of the vector \( \vec{n} \), which is 1 in this case. 

When the Hamiltonian is scaled by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \pm \varepsilon \). This corresponds to the eigenvalues \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \), which matches option B.

Answer: B
