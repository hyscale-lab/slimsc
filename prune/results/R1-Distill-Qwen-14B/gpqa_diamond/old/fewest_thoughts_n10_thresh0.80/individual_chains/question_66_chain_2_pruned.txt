Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that all operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my SMEFT, but I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators that are compatible with certain symmetries.

Wait, the question is asking which of the listed symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because it's an effective theory built from the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like invariance under moving the spacetime coordinates). But wait, the SMEFT is typically formulated in a fixed spacetime background, so I'm not sure if it's Poincare-invariant. Or wait, maybe SMEFT is constructed in a way that includes Poincare. Hmm, I might be mixing things up. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes translations, so invariance under spacetime translations is part of it. SMEFT is a field theory, so all terms should respect translation invariance. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) is also a symmetry that's respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct so far.

Then, CP symmetry. I'm not so sure about this. I recall that the SMEFT can include operators that break CP symmetry. For example, some terms in the effective theory can have phases that are not part of the SM, leading to possible CP violation. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP) isn't a must.

Next, CPT symmetry. CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I remember that in the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry because it's a quantum field theory with these symmetries. So SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, should also respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4).

Putting it together: the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait, earlier I was thinking about Poincare. Because Poincare includes translations and Lorentz, but is Poincare symmetry required in SMEFT?

Wait, the SMEFT is built in a way that respects all the symmetries of the Standard Model, except possibly for some beyond the SM. The SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT should also respect that. Because if the SM respects Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translation, and the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory built from SM fields, SMEFT operators would have to respect Poincare symmetry as well.

So, operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4.
