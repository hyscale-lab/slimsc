Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow since I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and chromatography concepts.

The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products through HPLC. Hmm, let's break down each reaction and see what's happening.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? LAH usually reduces carbonyl groups. So, looking at the structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The carbonyl is at position 3, so it's a ketone. When you reduce a ketone with LAH, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product after Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. LAH is a powerful reducing agent. Does it reduce any other groups? The compound also has a methoxy group at position 5. Methoxy is an ether, right? I don't think LAH typically reduces ethers. So, the only reduction is the ketone to an alcohol. So, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with the stereochemistry S. Because when the ketone is reduced, the configuration at the chiral center depends on the starting material. Since the starting material is S configuration, the resulting alcohol should retain that configuration. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up how the configuration works when reducing. Let me think: when you reduce a ketone, the stereochemistry isn't formed because the ketone is planar. Oh wait, wait! The starting material is (S) configuration at the 5-position? Or is the starting material a secondary alcohol? No, wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is a ketone. So the 3-position is the carbonyl. So, the 5-position is a methoxy group attached to the 5 carbon, which is probably a chiral center because the 5 carbon has four different substituents: the methoxy, two CH2 groups from the chain, and the adjacent carbons.

Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5th carbon. So when you reduce the ketone to an alcohol at position 3, the 5th carbon remains as a methoxy group. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has an alcohol at C3. But is that a chiral center? Let's see: C3, after reduction, has four different groups. The groups attached would be: -OH (from reduction), a CH2CH2CH3 (since it's hexan-3-one, so the chain is CH3CH2-CO... Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CH-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Let me sketch this. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2 is actually a longer chain. Let
