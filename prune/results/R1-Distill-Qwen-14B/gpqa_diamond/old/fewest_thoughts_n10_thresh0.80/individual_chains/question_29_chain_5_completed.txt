Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found mutations in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound.

So the question gives me the intact gene and four mutants. I need to look for which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Wait, the intact gene is the wild type, and the mutations are in the first exon. The exons are the coding regions, so any mutation here could affect the protein product.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change in the beginning of the sequence. Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing, the first few bases are different. Let me see:
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TTC TGT GGA TGA...
Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Intact:
Position 1-15: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC TGT

Mutant 1:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TTC TGT

Wait, let me count each triplet.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC TGT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TTC TGT...

So the first codon is the same: ATG (methionine). Second codon in intact is TTT (Phe), in mutant1 it's TTC (still Phe, same amino acid). Third codon: intact is CTC (Leu), mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Leu to Tyr. Then GCG becomes GCT (Ala to Ala? Wait, same as GCG is Ala, GCT is also Ala. So no change there. TGG is same (Trp). Wait, no, wait: the third codon is CTC in intact, which is Leu, and in mutant1 it's TAC which is Tyr. So that's a substitution.

But how does that affect the protein? If it's a substitution, maybe it's a missense mutation. But does that eliminate the compound? Maybe not necessarily. Unless it's a critical part of the enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift or nonsense mutation would be better. But looking at the mutants, the changes seem to be substitutions rather than insertions or deletions.

Wait, the question says that the gene consists of exons. So maybe they're looking for a mutation that creates a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated, which might disrupt its function.

Looking at the intact gene, the end is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the coding sequence must end before that. Hmm.

Wait, the given sequences show ...TGA-3’ at the end. Wait, but that's the end of the mRNA? Or the DNA? Because in DNA, TGA is not a stop codon; stop codons are on the mRNA (like UAA, UAG, UGA). So in DNA, TGA would transcribe to UGA, which is a stop codon. So if a mutation changes something earlier that introduces a stop codon, the protein would be shorter.

Let me check each mutant to see if any introduce a stop codon early.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant 1: Ends with TGA. But wait, the original also ends with TGA. So perhaps that's the same.

Wait, let me look for any changes that would cause a stop codon before the normal end.

In the first exon area, which is the beginning of the gene. So any mutation that creates a stop codon in the first exon would lead to a much shorter protein, likely disrupting function.

Let me see each mutant's changes:

Mutant 2:
Sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compare to intact: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC TGT...

Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TTC TGT...

So the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant2 it's TAA (stop codon). Oh wait, wait. So the mutant2 has a TAA in the third codon.

Wait, no, let me count the nucleotides. The original has ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC TGT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TTC TGT...

So the first codon is same (ATG). Second codon: TTT becomes TTC (Phe to Phe). Third codon: CTC becomes TAA. CTC is Leu, TAA is a stop codon (since it's TAA in DNA, which would transcribe to TAG, another stop codon). So in the mutant2, the third codon is now a stop. So the mRNA would have a stop after two amino acids.

So the protein would be very short, just the first two amino acids (Met, Phe), then stop. This would likely disrupt the gene function, as the protein is nonfunctional. So this mutant would probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

But wait, the question is, which mutation would let you eliminate the compound. So any mutation that disrupts the gene's function would do.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC TGT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, let's see the first few codons: same as intact except...

First codon: same. Second codon: TTT stays. Third codon: CTC becomes TAC (Leu to Tyr). Then GCG becomes GCT (Ala remains). TGG same. TAC becomes TTC? Wait, maybe I need to look more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the third codon in the mutant is different. Let me look again.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC TGT...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, looking at the first few:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the third codon is CTC (Leu) in original, becomes TAC (Tyr) in mutant3.

So that's a substitution. Then the next codon is GCG (Ala) in original, becomes GCT (Ala) in mutant3. No change. Then TGG (Trp) same. TAC becomes GTC (Val) in mutant3?

Wait, no. Let me see: in the original, after TAC, the next codon is TTC. In mutant3, after GGT comes GTC ACT.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the point is to look for a frameshift or a nonsense mutation.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTC TGT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So the third codon CTC becomes TAC (Leu to Tyr). Then GCG becomes ACT (Ala to Thr). Then TGG same. TAC becomes TCT (Ser). So this is again substitution, possibly leading to an altered protein but not necessarily a nonfunctional one.

Wait, but I thought Mutant2 had a stop codon. Let me double-check.

Mutant2: Looking at the third codon:

Original third codon: CTC (Leu)
Mutant2 third codon: TAA (stop)

Yes. So in mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would terminate after the second amino acid.

That's a nonsense mutation. That would likely disrupt the gene's product, as the protein is truncated.

So, the question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutrient, a mutation that disrupts the gene (like a premature stop) would stop the production of the compound.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Mutant2

Option B: Mutant3

Option C: Mutant1

Option D: Mutant4

So the correct answer would be A) Mutant2.

Wait, but the question says "some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." So all the mutations are in the first exon. But the key is which of them disrupts the gene.

Mutant2 introduces a stop codon early, which would likely cause the gene to be nonfunctional. So that's the likely candidate.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon, significantly altering or truncating the protein product.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Intact Gene**:  
   5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’  
   The sequence begins with ATG (start codon) and ends with TGA (stop codon in mRNA, corresponding to TGA in DNA). The first exon contains the coding sequence for the beginning of the protein.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’  
   - Codon 1: ATG (unchanged, Met).  
   - Codon 2: TTT → TTC (Phe → Phe, no change in amino acid).  
   - Codon 3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr, substitution).  
   This is a missense mutation, altering the protein but not introducing a premature stop codon.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’  
   - Codon 1: ATG (unchanged, Met).  
   - Codon 2: TTT → TTC (Phe → Phe, no change in amino acid).  
   - Codon 3: CTC → TAA (Leu → stop codon, premature termination).  
   This is a nonsense mutation, introducing a stop codon after the second amino acid. The protein is truncated, likely rendering it nonfunctional.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’  
   - Codon 1: ATG (unchanged, Met).  
   - Codon 2: TTT (unchanged, Phe).  
   - Codon 3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr, substitution).  
   - Codon 4: GCG → GCT (Ala → Ala, no change).  
   This is a missense mutation, altering the protein but not introducing a premature stop codon.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’  
   - Codon 1: ATG (unchanged, Met).  
   - Codon 2: TTT (unchanged, Phe).  
   - Codon 3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr, substitution).  
   - Codon 4: GCG → ACT (Ala → Thr, substitution).  
   This is a missense mutation, altering the protein but not introducing a premature stop codon.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) in the third codon, leading to a truncated protein. This is the most likely mutation to disrupt the gene's function and eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
