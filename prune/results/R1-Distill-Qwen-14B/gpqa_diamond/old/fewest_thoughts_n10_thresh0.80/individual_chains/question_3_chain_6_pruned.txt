Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The problem is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle in a given state. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

The particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I think these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. Oh right, σz is one of the Pauli matrices, which are used to describe spin in different directions.

The operator given is 10σz + 5σx. So I need to find the expectation value of this operator. That should be the expectation of 10σz plus the expectation of 5σx, right? Because expectation values are linear, so E[aA + bB] = aE[A] + bE[B].

So I can break this down into two parts: calculating the expectation of σz and then σx, multiply each by their coefficients, and add them together.

First, let's tackle the σz part. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their eigenvalues are known. I think σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So the expectation value of σz is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me check if these are normalized. The sum of squares should be 1: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yep, that's good.

The probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and for |↓⟩ it's |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So the expectation value of σz is 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then the expectation value of 10σz would be 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part down.

Now the tricky part is σx. I remember that σx has eigenstates that are the same as the spin states in the x-direction, but our state is in the z-basis. So I probably can't directly use the same approach. Hmm, what's the expectation value of σx in a general state?

Wait, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So for σx, it should be ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me write down the state ψ as a vector. In the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, σ matrices are 2x2 matrices.

The state ψ can be written as a column vector: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The operator σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I compute ψ† σx ψ, that's the expectation value.

Let me compute that. The conjugate transpose of ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], because the coefficients are real here. So ψ† σx is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by σx, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σx would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then multiply this by ψ: [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] times [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So the product is (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute each term:

sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = (sqrt(3)/2) * 1/2 = sqrt(3)/4.
Similarly, 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4.
Adding them together: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, so the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2? That's about 0.866.

But wait a second, let me think again. Because sometimes σx is represented differently, but no, I think that's correct. The calculation seems right. So the expectation value of 5σx is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another approach: the expectation value of σx can also be found using the formula. Since σx has eigenstates |+⟩ and |−⟩, but our state is in the z-basis. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for spin-1/2 systems. The expectation value of σx in state ψ is 2 times the probability of measuring spin in the x-direction being up. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here.

Wait, let's try another approach. Since the state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b) where a and b are the coefficients. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think. Because σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|), so ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is a* b + b* a. Because when you expand it:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a^* ⟨↑| + b^* ⟨↓|) σx (a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩ )

Since σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so:

= a^* a ⟨↑|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↑|↑⟩ + b^* a ⟨
