Okay, so I've got this problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is about finding the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I remember that in such wells, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum number n.

Each particle is a spin-1/2, which I think means electrons or something similar. But wait, since the well is one-dimensional and they're spin-1/2, does that affect the energy? Oh right, for identical particles like electrons, which are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each particle in the same quantum state must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin.

The potential well is of length L, and the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh wait, the question defines E as E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E. So E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3=9E, etc.

So the problem is about four particles in this well. Since they are spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each spatial quantum state (each n), there can be two particles with opposite spins.

In the ground state, we want the lowest possible energy configuration. Since each n can hold 2 particles, four particles would fill up the lowest two states. Let's see: the first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles, and n=2 can hold another 2. Because 2+2=4, so all four particles are filled up in the first two levels.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for n=1, you can have two particles (spin up and down). Then for n=2, another two (spin up and down). So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two of them: 2E. Each in n=2 contributes 4E, two of them: 8E. So total energy is 2E +8E =10E? Wait, but wait, no. Because each particle is in a specific state. So the total
