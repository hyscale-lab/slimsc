Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, right, the problem states that both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, I think that means I can use classical mechanics here instead of relativity because they're both non-accelerating. Wait, but waitâ€”if they're moving towards each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light, maybe I should think about it in terms of relative velocity and time dilation.

Wait, no, the note says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So, perhaps it's just a straightforward velocity problem without needing to consider gravitational effects or anything else. So maybe I can ignore relativity effects like time dilation and length contraction because the problem doesn't mention them. Hmm, but the given velocity is 60,000 km/s. Let me think: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. That's not negligible, so special relativity might come into play. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't say anything about time dilation or length contraction, so maybe it's intended to be a classical problem. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the question is, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in its own frame.

Wait, but time in different frames. So if the ejecta experiences 50 seconds, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because time might dilate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using classical velocity addition. Wait, no, because in classical terms, the velocities would just add up.

Wait, let me clarify: in the ejecta frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So the question is, in the galaxy's frame, how far does the ejecta go in a certain amount of time. But wait, the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So we might need to find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, that's the key. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at some speed, but the time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds. So I need to find the time in the galaxy's frame for that 50 seconds.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up here. Let me think again. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the
