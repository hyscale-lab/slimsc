Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

Alright, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a possible relative speed and energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. We need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, but wait a minute. The relative speed between the two astronauts would be the speed of one as observed from the other's frame. Or is it the other way around? Let me get that straight.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, I think I might be mixing the order here. Because u is the velocity of the first object, and v is the velocity of the second, as observed from the same frame. So in this case, both are moving in the same direction; the first is at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²). Wait, that's (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) which is (0.1c)/(0.7) which is approximately 0.142857c. So about 0.14c, which matches some of the options. Hmm, so that's the relative speed part.

But wait, I thought that if you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference divided by 1 minus the product of their velocities over c squared. So yeah, that gives us approximately 0.14c. I think that's correct.

Now for the total energy. The total energy of each astronaut is their relativistic energy,
