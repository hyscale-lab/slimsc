Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and then calculating the average value of an operator. Hmm. Let me read it again.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So, first, I should normalize this state because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Wait, wait. The state is given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. So I need to find the normalization constant. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 -i) for |down>.

The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should equal 1. So I need to compute |1+i|² + |2-i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: The modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 + 1=2.

Then |2 -i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total squared sum is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state becomes (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

But wait, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of a different operator. The operator has a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. Oh wait, no: the matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 when i≠j, and zero otherwise. So the matrix is:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

So this is a 2x2 matrix. What's the significance of this operator? Hmm. Let me think. That matrix looks familiar. Oh right, it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So our operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So the eigenstates of operator A are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstate |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because the Pauli X operator flips the spin states.

So the question is about expressing |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, then the probabilities will be the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for each eigenstate.

Alternatively, since the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, we can rewrite |alpha> as a linear combination of these.

Wait, but I think another approach is to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, then the square of the absolute value is the probability.

Yes, that's right. So the probability to measure +x is |< +x | alpha >|^2 and similarly for -x.

So first, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

But let me write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). So:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, let's express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We know that |up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) and |down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7).

So,

|alpha> = [ (1+i + 2 -i) |+x> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |-x> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Wait, let me compute the coefficients step by step.

The coefficients for |+x>:

(1+i) * 1/sqrt(2) + (2 -i) * 1/sqrt(2) 

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2)

= (1+2) + (i -i) ) / sqrt(2)

= 3 / sqrt(2)

Similarly, the coefficient for |-x>:

(1+i) * 1/sqrt(2) + (2 -i) * (-1)/sqrt(2)

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2)

= (1-2) + (i +i) ) / sqrt(2)

= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(2)

So putting it all together:

|alpha> = [ (3 / sqrt(2)) |+x> + (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(2) |-x> ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, because the denominator is sqrt(7), and each term has sqrt(2) in the denominator. So overall, each term is divided by sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14).

Wait, no. Let me recast it correctly.

Wait, the entire expression is:

[ (3 |+x> + (-1 +2i) |-x> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Which is the same as (3 |+x> + (-1+2i) |-x> ) / sqrt(14).

So the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14).

Therefore, the probability of measuring +x is |3/sqrt(14)|^2.

Compute that: (9) /14. Because 3^2=9, and (sqrt(14))^2=14.

Similarly, the probability for |-x> is | (-1+2i)/sqrt(14) |^2.

Compute that: | -1 +2i |^2 is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So 5/14.

So probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, looking at the options, the first option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 9/14 and 5/14. But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857..., which is about 0.643. So that's about 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is about 0.357, which would round to 0.36. So that's option A, but let's check the rest.

Wait, the question also asks for the average value of that operator. The operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j, 0 otherwise. So the operator is (hbar/2)(|up><down| + |down><up| ). Which is (hbar/2)(sigma_x), since sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

The expectation value of A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) <sigma_x>.

The expectation value of sigma_x in a given state is given by <sigma_x> = |a|^2 - |b|^2, where a and b are the coefficients of |up> and |down> in the state.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For spin-1/2 systems, the expectation value of sigma_x is 2 Re( a b^* ), where a and b are the coefficients of |up> and |down>.

Hmm, or wait, the formula for <sigma_x> is 2( |a|^2 - |b|^2 )? Or is it 2 Re( a b^* )? Let's clarify.

The Pauli matrix sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So for a state |psi> = a|up> + b|down>, the expectation value is <psi| sigma_x |psi> = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + a b^* + a^* b.

Wait, no, more precisely:

sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So <sigma_x> = a* a_down + b* a_up.

Wait, no, better to compute it directly.

Let me compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

|alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all over sqrt(7).

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] + [ (2 + i)/sqrt(7) (1 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Wait, |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

sigma_x |alpha> = a |down> + b |up>.

Then <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = a^* b + b^* a.

Which is 2 Re(a^* b ), as sigma_x is Hermitian.

So a^* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a^* b = (1 - i)(2 - i) / 7.

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i² = 2-3i -1 (since i²=-1) → (2-1) -3i = 1-3i.

So a^* b = (1-3i)/7.

The real part is (1)/7. So 2 Re(a^* b ) = 2*(1/7) = 2/7.

Therefore, the expectation value of sigma_x is 2/7.

So the expectation value of operator A, which is (hbar/2) sigma_x, is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Wait, that's a neat result. So the average value is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which are 9/14 and 5/14. And the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. That matches.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), as well as calculating the average value of \( A \). The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation where \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \hbar/2 \, \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \) are \( (1+i) \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( (2-i) \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the condition \( |\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle| = 1 \). The squared magnitudes of the coefficients are:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5.
\]
Thus, the total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), and the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). The normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Rewrite \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |\pm x\rangle \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \). Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), the state becomes:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}} |+x\rangle + \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}} |-x\rangle \right].
\]
Simplifying the coefficients:
\[
\text{Coefficient of } |+x\rangle: \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad \text{Coefficient of } |-x\rangle: \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is the squared magnitude of its coefficient:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643.
\]
The probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is the squared magnitude of its coefficient:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of \( A \)
The operator \( A = \hbar/2 \, \sigma_x \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(a^* b),
\]
where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Compute \( a^* b \):
\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}.
\]
The real part is \( \text{Re}(a^* b) = \frac{1}{7} \), so:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). These match the values in **Option A**.
