Alright, I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let me read it carefully and think through the problem step by step.

So, the setup is that we're looking at white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. We've got three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They created knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The question is about the interaction between these genes and their roles in disease resistance.

The key point given is that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor that acts upstream of others. The experiment's results show the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%. Let's list out the results:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less than wild-type but not super susceptible.
- g2: 0% resistance. That means the plants are completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance. Half as resistant as wild-type.
- g1g3: 10% resistance. Very low, almost susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2.

Hmm, let's think about what this tells us. When a gene is knocked out, if the resistance goes down, that gene probably contributes positively to resistance. If the double mutants have lower resistance than either single, that might indicate some interaction.

First, looking at the single mutants:

- g2 is completely susceptible, so G2 is probably a critical gene. Since it has such a severe effect, maybe G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream. Because when you lose G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all.

Looking at the double mutants:

- When both G1 and G2 are knocked out (g1g2), the resistance is 0% like g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1. Because even if you have a mutation in G1, the presence of a functional G2 would be what matters. Wait, but in g1g2, both are mutated. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the hierarchy.

What's epistasis? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. For example, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then the presence of a functional G2 can mask the effect of G1. So, if G2 is inactivated, then the effect of G1 might not be seen anymore.

Wait, but in the single mutant g2, they have 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant can't resist. What about g1? It's 75%, so it's less resistant than wild-type but not completely susceptible. When we look at the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%, same as g2. So, the presence of G1 in a g2 background didn't help. That might suggest that G2 is upstream of G1. Because if you have a non-functional G2, even if G1 is working, it doesn't help. So, G2's function is required for G1's effect.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, G1's function is irrelevant. So that would mean G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's pathway is upstream, and without it, G1's effect doesn't matter.

Now, looking at G3. The single mutant g3 has 50% resistance, so it's half as resistant. So G3 contributes to resistance, but not as much as G2.

Double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% resistance. So, lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). Wait, but wait:
