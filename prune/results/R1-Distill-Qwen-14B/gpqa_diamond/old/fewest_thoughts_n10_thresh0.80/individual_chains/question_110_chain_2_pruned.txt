Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I'll read the question again. The question is asking which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So, the stars must have V magnitudes that are brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, but wait—ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17, meaning up to 17 mag? Or does it mean stars with V magnitudes less than or equal to 17? Because higher magnitude numbers mean fainter objects. So, if a star is brighter (lower magnitude), it's easier to detect. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤ 17 mag because anything brighter (lower magnitude) than 17 is acceptable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag. So, to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag because that's the lower threshold (brighter limit) of the two.

Now I need to look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitudes. Wait, the question gives some stars with absolute V magnitudes and some with apparent. Oh wait, Star1 has absolute V mag 15.5 and is at 10 pc. Star2's apparent is given as 16.5 mag. Star3's apparent is 15.5 mag. Star4 has absolute mag 15.5 and is at 10 pc. Star5 has absolute mag 16.5 and is at 5 pc.

Wait, but Star3 and Star4 also have E(B-V) given. So I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes considering interstellar extinction (absorption). Oh, right, the question says that the total absorption in V is E(B-V) times 3.1. So, extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So for each star, I need to compute their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction, and see if it meets the criteria for both spectrographs.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So m =15.5 +5*log10(10/10) =15.5 +5*0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Now, does this star have any extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star1, so I assume E(B-V)=0. So extinction A_V=0. Therefore, the apparent magnitude is 15.5. 

Now, check if this is within both instruments. ESPRESSO can handle up to 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16. So 15.5 is ≤16, so it can be detected by both? Wait, because 15.5 is less than 17 and less than 16. Wait, no, 15.5 is less than 16, so it's within HIRES's limit, yes. So Star1 can be detected by both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5, and E(B-V) is not given. So no extinction. So m=16.5. Now, can this be detected by both? HIRES can go up to 16, so 16.5 is fainter than that. So HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 <17). So Star2 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it's not a common candidate.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=3.1 * 0.6=1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude is actually m = 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36. Wait, but wait—apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_V, where m0 is the unreddened magnitude. So if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, the apparent magnitude increases. So the observed m is 15.5 + 1.86=17.36. So m=17.36.

So, can this star be detected by both? HIRES can't handle beyond 16, so 17.36 is too faint. ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, so 17.36 is beyond. So Star3's apparent mag is 17.36, which is beyond both instruments. So Star3 can't be detected by either? Wait, but wait: the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17. So stars with V ≤17 can be observed. 17.36 is fainter, so no. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but wait: Star3's given apparent V is 15.5. Wait no, no. Wait, the question says Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So after
