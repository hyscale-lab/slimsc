Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super fast spacecraft. The speed is given as 0.99999987 times the speed of light, c. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years, which is like 150 years each. They want to come to Earth, and the astronaut is 22 years old. The question is, how long will the trip take from the astronaut's perspective?

Wait, the options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. The options are A to D, with A saying the astronaut dies before reaching, others give years.

I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time moves slower for the traveler relative to a stationary observer. But wait, in this case, the question is from the astronaut's point of view. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, let me think about the formula. The time experienced by the traveler, the proper time τ (tau), is related to the coordinate time t (as measured by someone else) by the Lorentz factor gamma (γ). The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, no, actually, the proper time is the time experienced in the moving frame, which is the astronaut's frame here. So the coordinate time (Earth's frame) is longer.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. When the astronaut is moving at a high speed, Earth time would be longer. So the Earth observer would see the trip taking more time, but the astronaut would age less.

Wait, but the question is about the astronaut's lifetime. The astronaut is 22 now and wants to reach Earth. How old would they be when they arrive?

So first, I think I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, what's the distance? Oh, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think the distance is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. Actually, the average distance is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. Let's approximate it as, say, 170,000 light-years because that's a common figure.

Wait, but the exact figure might not matter if the problem gives us the time from Earth's frame. Oh wait, the problem doesn't state the distance. Hmm, that complicates things. So maybe I need to compute the time as experienced by the astronaut.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that the distance is such that from Earth's perspective, the trip takes a certain amount of time, but the astronaut's time is less because of time dilation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. So the proper time τ is given by the equation:

τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Where t is the time measured in Earth's frame.

But wait, how do I get t? Because t would be the time it takes for the spacecraft to reach Earth as seen from Earth. So the time t is distance divided by speed.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it by first calculating the time experienced by the astronaut, given the speed and the distance.

But without the distance, I'm stuck. Oh wait, maybe the question is implying that the distance is the same as the distance light would travel in a certain time, but again, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the astronaut's age based on their own time, using the speed given.

Wait, maybe I should think about the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for v = 0.99999987*c, v is very close to c. Let me compute gamma.

v = 0.99999987 c. So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051 (since 0.0005^2 is 2.5e-7, so 0.00051 squared is about 2.6e-7).

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960. So gamma is approximately 1960.

Wait, but gamma is the factor by which time dilates. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock runs slower. But from the astronaut's perspective, Earth clocks are moving and thus are the ones that run slower.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the astronaut's experienced time. So the proper time is what the astronaut measures. So the proper time τ is t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but t_earth is the time it takes to travel the distance as measured from Earth. So t_earth = distance / speed.

But without knowing the distance, I can't compute t_earth. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the time experienced by the astronaut based on the speed and the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the distance as the same as the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, which I thought was about 160,000 light-years.

Wait, let's assume the distance is D = 163,000 light-years. Because I remember that the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth.

So, D = 163,000 light-years.

Speed v = 0.99999987 c.

So, from Earth's frame, the time t_earth is D / v.

t_earth = (163,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 c) ≈ (163,000 / 1) (years) / (0.99999987) ≈ about 163,000 / 1 years, since 0.99999987 is almost 1.

So t_earth ≈ 163,000 years.

Wait, but that's a long time. The astronaut's own lifetime is 150 years, but from the astronaut's perspective, the trip would take less time due to time dilation.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So, how much time would pass for them? Let's compute τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

As I computed earlier, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is about 0.00051.

So τ = 163,000 years * 0.00051 ≈ 163,000 * 0.00051.

Calculating that: 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5 years. And 163,000 * 0.00001 = 1.63. So total is approximately 81.5 + 1.63 = 83.13 years. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.0005 is 5e-4, so 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5. Then 0.00001 is 1e-5, so 163e3 * 1e-5 = 1.63. So 81.5 + 1.63 = 83.13 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years.

Wait, but wait, the astronaut is only 22 years old. If the trip takes about 83 years from their perspective, then they would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival. But their average lifetime is 150 years, so 105 is less than 150, so they would live to reach Earth.

But wait, the options are A) die before, B)72, C)81, D)77.

Wait, but my calculation gives around 83 years, but the options don't have that. Closest is C)81. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.99999987 c.

Compute beta = v/c = 0.99999987.

Beta squared: (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute that more precisely.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Well, (1 - 1.23e-6)^2 = 1 - 2*1.23e-6 + (1.23e-6)^2.

Which is approximately 1 - 2.46e-6 + 1.51e-12 ≈ 0.99999754.

So 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.99999754 = 0.00000246.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(0.00000246) ≈ sqrt(2.46e-6) ≈ 0.00157.

Wait, wait, wait. Earlier I thought 1 - v²/c² is about 0.00000026, but now I get 0.00000246. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in beta squared.

Wait, (0.99999987) is 1 - 1.23e-6.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a². When a is 1.23e-6, a squared is negligible, so (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.23e-6 = 1 - 2.46e-6 ≈ 0.99999754. So yes, 1 - beta squared is 2.46e-6. So the square root is sqrt(2.46e-6) ≈ 0.001568.

So gamma is 1 / 0.001568 ≈ 637.

Wait, that's a big difference from my initial calculation. Hmm, so gamma is about 637?

Wait, wait: 1/0.001568 is approximately 637. So yes. So then, the proper time τ is t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Wait, t_earth is 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years, since 0.99999987 is almost 1.

So τ = 163,000 * 0.001568 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 * 0.001568.

Well, 163,000 * 0.001 is 163.

163,000 * 0.000568 = 163,000 * 5.68e-4.

Compute 163,000 * 5e-4 = 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163,000 * 0.000068 = 0.000068 * 163,000.

0.000068 * 163,000 = 0.068 * 163 = approx 11.084.

So adding 81.5 and 11.084 gives 92.584.

So τ ≈ 163 + 92.584 = Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, I think I messed up the steps.

Let me re-calculate.

163,000 * 0.001568 = ?

Let me think of it as 163,000 * (1.568e-3) = 163,000 * 0.001568.

Compute 163,000 * 0.001 = 163.

Compute 163,000 * 0.000568 = 163,000 * 5.68e-4.

5.68e-4 is 0.000568.

So 163,000 * 0.000568 = ?

Let's compute 163 * 568.

Wait, 163 * 568. Hmm.

163 * 500 = 81,500.

163 * 60 = 9,780 → total 91,280.

163 * 8 = 1,304 → total 92,584.

So 163,000 * 0.000568 = 92.584.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 163,000 * (5.68e-4) = 163,000 * (568e-6) = (163,000 * 568) * 1e-6.

163,000 * 568 = 163 * 568 * 1000.

Earlier, 163 * 568 is 92,584. So 92,584 * 1000 = 92,584,000.

Multiply by 1e-6 → 92,584,000 * 1e-6 = 92.584.

So 163,000 * 0.000568 = 92.584.

So the total τ is 163 (from 0.001) plus 92.584 (from 0.000568) → 163 +92.584=255.584 years? That can't be right because earlier I thought the proper time was about 83 years. Wait, no, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. Let me re-express.

Wait, 0.001568 = 0.001 + 0.000568.

So τ = 163,000 * 0.001 + 163,000 * 0.000568.

Which is 163 + 92.584 = 255.584 years.

Wait, that's a problem because if the astronaut is 22, and the trip takes 255 years from their perspective, they would be 277 years old, which is impossible since their lifespan is 150 years. So they would die during the trip.

But that can't be right because the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the distance isn't 163,000 light-years. Maybe the problem is implying that the trip from the astronaut's perspective would take a certain time, and given their lifetime, they can reach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance as the same as the speed multiplied by time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the distance in the astronaut's frame. Since the astronaut is moving at speed v, the distance they observe is length-contracted. So the distance D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D * 0.001568.

Then, the time experienced by the astronaut τ = D' / v.

So let's compute that.

D = 163,000 light-years.

D' = 163,000 * 0.001568 ≈ 163,000 * 0.001568 ≈ 255 light-years.

So τ = D' / v ≈ 255 ly / (0.99999987 c) ≈ 255 years.

Wait, that can't be right because 255 years is longer than their lifespan of 150 years.

Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time), which is the time we're looking for.

Proper time τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth * 0.001568.

But t_earth is D/v = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

So τ ≈ 163,000 * 0.001568 ≈ 255 years.

But the astronaut's age is 22, so 22 + 255 = 277, which is way beyond 150. So the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, the options don't have 255 years. The options are 72, 81, 77, or die before.

Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the distance from Earth as a certain number of light-years, but I don't have the exact figure. Maybe the distance is about 100 light-years? No, the LMC is much farther.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the distance as the same as the time it takes light to reach Earth from the LMC, which is 163,000 years, but that doesn't directly help.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me compute the time experienced by the astronaut using the formula τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time from Earth's frame.

But without knowing the distance, perhaps I can relate the times.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed and the time from Earth's frame to compute the astronaut's time.

Wait, but the question doesn't provide the distance. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem statement says that the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987*c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So from the astronaut's perspective, how long will the trip take?

Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the distance is such that the trip, from Earth's perspective, takes a certain amount of time, and the astronaut's time is shorter.

But without the distance, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the idea that if the astronaut is traveling at v, the distance is D, then τ = D/(v gamma).

Wait, or maybe it's D/(v) multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as τ = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / (v / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) = D / (gamma v).

Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so 1/gamma = sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So τ = (D / v) * (1/gamma).

So τ = D/(v gamma).

But I don't know D.

Wait, perhaps the distance D is the same as the time it takes light to reach Earth from the LMC, which is about 163,000 light-years. So D = 163,000 ly.

So τ = 163,000 ly / (v * gamma).

v is 0.99999987 c, and gamma is about 637 as calculated earlier.

So v * gamma is 0.99999987 c * 637 ≈ 636.999 c. Because 0.99999987 ≈ 1, so 637.

So τ = 163,000 ly / (637 c) = (163,000 / 637) years.

Because 1 ly / c is 1 year, so 1 ly / (c * 637) ≈ 1/637 years.

So 163,000 / 637 ≈ let's calculate that.

637 * 255 = 637 * 250 = 159,250, plus 637*5=3,185 → 162,435. Close to 163,000.

So 255 years would give 637 * 255 ≈ 162,435. So 163,000 - 162,435 = 565 left. 565 / 637 ≈ 0.888. So total τ ≈ 255.888 years.

So τ is about 256 years.

So the astronaut would experience 256 years, which would make them 22 + 256 = 278 years old, which is way beyond their 150-year lifespan. So they would die before reaching Earth. So the answer would be A.

But wait, the options don't have that. The options are A) die before, B)72, C)81, D)77.

Wait, but according to my calculations, the time is 256 years, so the astronaut would die. So the correct answer is A.

But wait, maybe the distance is shorter. Maybe the distance is something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the distance of the LMC as 160,000 ly, and the speed is 0.99999987c, so t_earth is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years.

Then, the proper time τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000 * 0.001568 ≈ 250.88 years.

Again, the astronaut would be 272 years old, which is longer than their lifespan. So they die before reaching.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the actual distance but just the time experienced by the astronaut. Wait, but without the distance, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question. The speed is so close to c that the time experienced by the astronaut is negligible, but that can't be right because even at 0.99c, the time is significantly less than the Earth time.

Wait, perhaps I should check the gamma factor again. Wait, earlier I thought beta was 0.99999987, so beta squared is 0.99999974, so 1 - beta squared is 0.00000026.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate beta squared accurately.

0.99999987 squared is (1 - 1.23e-6)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.23e-6) + (1.23e-6)^2. Since (1.23e-6)^2 is 1.5e-12, negligible. So 1 - 2.46e-6 = 0.99999754.

So 1 - beta squared is 2.46e-6. So sqrt(1 - beta squared) is sqrt(2.46e-6) ≈ 0.001568.

So gamma is 1 / 0.001568 ≈ 637.

So t_earth is D / v = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) ≈ 163,000 years.

Then, τ = 163,000 * 0.001568 ≈ 255.5 years.

So astronaut's age upon arrival: 22 + 255.5 = 277.5 years. They can't live that long, so they die before reaching.

So the answer would be A.

But let's look at the options again. Option A is "The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth."

But wait, the problem states that the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So if the trip takes 255 years from their perspective, they would die.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is approximately \( D = 163,000 \) light-years. The astronaut's perspective is the proper frame, so the proper time \( \tau \) experienced by the astronaut is related to the time measured in Earth's frame \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) by the Lorentz factor:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]
For \( v = 0.99999987c \), we compute:
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.001568
\]
Thus:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.001568} \approx 637
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \)
From Earth's frame, the time to travel the distance \( D = 163,000 \) light-years is:
\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the proper time \( \tau \)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:
\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 163,000 \cdot 0.001568 \approx 255.5 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the astronaut's age upon arrival
The astronaut is initially 22 years old. After traveling for \( \tau \approx 255.5 \) years, their age would be:
\[
22 + 255.5 = 277.5 \, \text{years}
\]
Since the astronaut's average lifetime is 150 years, they would die before reaching Earth.

### Conclusion
The astronaut will not survive the journey to Earth. 

ANSWER: A
