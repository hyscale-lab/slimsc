Okay, let's try to figure out this transit probability question. So, researchers want to observe transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time and want to choose the one with the higher probability of transiting. 

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. I think it's related to the size of the planet and the star, as well as the size of the planet's orbit. Oh right, the transit probability formula is something like (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by some other factors, maybe R_p is the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (which for a circular orbit is the radius of the orbit). Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, but also depends on the star's size. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p + R_s) / a, but that's the size of the planet compared to the star. Oh, no, I think the transit probability is given by the ratio of the areas or something like that.

Wait, I think the formula is P_transit = (R_p + R_s) / a, but actually, I'm not so sure. Let me think again. Oh, no, I think the probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk. So it's (π R_p²) / (π R_s²) ) = (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, that can't be right because the
