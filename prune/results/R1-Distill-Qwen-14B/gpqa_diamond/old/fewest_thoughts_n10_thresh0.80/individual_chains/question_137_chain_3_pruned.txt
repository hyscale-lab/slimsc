Alright, let me try to work through this problem. Okay, so the question is about a synchrocyclotron and how many revolutions a proton makes to reach a certain kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

So, from what I recall, cyclotrons accelerate particles using a magnetic field and an electric field that alternates. The key point is that the particles move in a circular path, and the electric field accelerates them each time they pass through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes. The magnetic field keeps them moving in a circle by providing the centripetal force.

Wait, but this is a synchrocyclotron, which I think is a type of cyclotron. The main difference is that in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage varies with time to match the changing velocity of the particle as it's accelerated. That makes sense because as the particle gains energy, its speed increases, so the frequency of the accelerating voltage must change to keep in sync with the particle's rotation.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy (so T ≈ 0) and undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where Φ0 is π/4 and U0 is 190 kV.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. So I need
