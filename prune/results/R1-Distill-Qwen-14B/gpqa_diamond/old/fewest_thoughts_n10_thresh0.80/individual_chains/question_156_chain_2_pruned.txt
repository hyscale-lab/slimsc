Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves two reactions with mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide group to alkenes.

The first reaction is (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. The second is (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both reactions go to completion.

Wait, so what happens when an alkene reacts with mCPBA? I think it forms an epoxide. Because mCPBA is a peracid, and epoxidation is a typical reaction for peracids with alkenes. So each starting alkene (E and Z isomers) would form an epoxide.

But wait, the configuration of the starting alkene might affect the epoxide's configuration. Let me think. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. So when mCPBA adds across the double bond, the stereochemistry of the epoxide would depend on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Epoxidation is a concerted process, I believe. The peracid adds across the double bond, forming an oxirane (epoxide) ring. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene would influence the configuration of the epoxide. Oh, wait, no, waitâ€”I remember that mCPBA adds in a way that the epoxide has the same stereochemistry as the double bond. So, if the alkene is E, the epoxide would form with a certain diastereomer, and Z would form another.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. For a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Or wait, maybe it's the same configuration. Actually, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let's think. When mCPBA attacks a double bond, the peracid's oxygen adds across the double
