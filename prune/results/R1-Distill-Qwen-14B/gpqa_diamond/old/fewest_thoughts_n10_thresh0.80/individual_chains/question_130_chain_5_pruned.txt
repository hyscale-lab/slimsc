Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of objects (like quasars) such that the neutral hydrogen clouds can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that when light passes through a cloud of hydrogen, it can absorb certain wavelengths. Oh right, the Lyman alpha emission line is at about 1216 Angstroms. Lyman alpha is a specific transition in hydrogen, right? And this absorption happens in the ultraviolet range because that's where the Lyman series lies.

So the quasar emits light, and if there's a cloud of neutral hydrogen in front of it, that cloud will absorb the Lyman alpha wavelength. But wait, the quasar's light gets redshifted because the universe is expanding. So the wavelength we observe will be longer than 1216 Angstroms. But wait, no—wait, no, if the cloud is in front of the quasar, the quasar's light is coming from behind, right? Or wait, no, I think the cloud is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's emitted light is at 1216 Angstroms, but when it passes through the cloud, the hydrogen in the cloud absorbs at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's rest frame. But because the cloud is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, the wavelength we observe is longer—this is the concept of redshift.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The quasar emits light which then passes through a hydrogen cloud. The hydrogen in the cloud absorbs at its own rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 Angstroms). But because the cloud is moving away, the absorption line we observe is shifted to a longer wavelength. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to the emitted wavelength (1216) multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z).

But the question is about using optical telescopes. Optical wavelengths are longer than ultraviolet. So the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range for ground-based telescopes to detect it. So what's the cutoff? I think optical light is roughly from 400 nm (v
