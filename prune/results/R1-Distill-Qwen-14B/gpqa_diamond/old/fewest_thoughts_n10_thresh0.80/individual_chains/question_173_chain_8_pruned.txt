Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and an electron's energy. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved here. Let me think about what I know.

The question says the electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, right? Or sometimes it's written as approximately Δx ≈ Δp/ħ, but I might be mixing the exact form. Oh right, the general form is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (which is h/(2π)).

So, since Δx is given, I can find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy. But wait, how does momentum relate to energy? Oh, right, the kinetic energy of a particle is given by K.E. = p²/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, then the uncertainty in kinetic energy would be approximately (Δp)²/(2m). But wait, since we're dealing with uncertainties, maybe we can approximate ΔE ≈ Δp²/(2m). That makes sense because the energy depends quadratically on momentum, so the uncertainty in energy would be on the order of (Δp)^2/(2m).

So the plan is:
1. Calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle.
2. Use that Δp to find the uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Let me jot down the known values:
Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters = 1e-10 m.
v = 2e8 m/s. Hmm, wait, do I need this? Because I'm using the uncertainty principle, which relates Δx and Δp. So maybe the velocity isn't directly used. Or perhaps the momentum is calculated from velocity, but wait, no—since the uncertainty in momentum is Δp, not the actual momentum.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The actual momentum p is m*v, where m is the mass of the electron. But the uncertainty in momentum Δp relates to the uncertainty in position. So I think the velocity given might not directly affect the calculation of Δp because the uncertainty principle is about the product of uncertainties, not the actual values.

So, step 1: Find Δp.
Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2 → Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx)
Let me compute that. What's ħ? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 / 6.283 ≈ about 1.055e-34 J·s.

So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) → let's compute that.
