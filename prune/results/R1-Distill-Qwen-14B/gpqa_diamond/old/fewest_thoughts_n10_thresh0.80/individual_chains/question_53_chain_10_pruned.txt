Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound has an FTIR spectrum showing ester groups. Ester groups usually have strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1, right? So that's a clue about the functional groups present.

The 1H NMR spectrum is described, and there are six signals. Let me break down the signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the protons on the ring would typically be in a certain pattern. In para substitution, you have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a singlet maybe? But wait, if it's di-substituted but not in para positions, like maybe ortho or meta, the splitting can be different. Wait, the aromatic signals are two, so perhaps it's a para substitution. Because in para, the two sets of aromatic protons would each be equivalent, leading to two signals. But wait, if it's di-substituted but not in para, like ortho, then the substituents are adjacent, so the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs. Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually on double bonds, like in an ester group maybe? Ester groups have R-O-CO-O-R structures, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. Wait, the vinyl protons are probably from a double bond elsewhere. Oh, maybe the substituents on the ring include a vinyl group, like part of an ester or another double bond.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So, there are two different methyl groups. Maybe each is attached to a different part of the molecule, like in an ester or another functional group.

No signals for –CH2 groups, which suggests that the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. So the structure probably doesn't have any -CH2- linkages. So substituents are likely either CH3 or something else without CH2.

The options for the chemical formula are four: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

So the question is what is the molecular formula of the compound.

Let me think about the structure. The aromatic ring is 6-membered, di-substituted. It has an ester group, which is O and COO. So the formula must include these.

An ester group has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So the overall formula would include O from the ester.

Each ester group contributes two oxygen atoms. Wait, no, ester is O from the ether part and the carbonyl. So each ester is O2, but wait, the structure is R-O-CO-R', so that's two oxygen in the ester group. So if the molecule has an ester, then the oxygen count is at least two. But since the options all have O2, that's consistent.

Now, the di-substituted ring: each substituent is likely to be an ester group or something else. But since the IR shows an ester, perhaps one substituent is an ester. But wait, the molecule is di-substituted, so two substituents. Maybe one is an ester group and another substituent is a methyl group, or another group without CH2.

Wait, wait. Let me think about NMR signals. The aromatic protons: two signals. So perhaps the substituents are in a way that produces two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. For example, if it's para-substituted, the substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent Hs. So the substituents are in the para positions.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are two ester groups, but that's unlikely because the molecular formula would have more oxygens. Or perhaps one substit
