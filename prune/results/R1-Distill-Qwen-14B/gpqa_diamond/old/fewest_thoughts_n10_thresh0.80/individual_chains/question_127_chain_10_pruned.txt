Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes are heated, they can undergo certain reactions, maybe like elimination or addition? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, if there are adjacent double bonds or certain structures, heating can cause them to rearrange through something called a hydride shift or maybe a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. But wait, another possibility is that it might undergo a process like dehydrohalogenation if there's a leaving group, but wait, the compound here doesn't seem to have any halogens. Oh wait, maybe it's an elimination reaction leading to a more substituted double bond.

Wait, the starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me try to draw its structure. Okay, nona means nine carbons. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, and the substituent is a butyl group at position 5. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH2CH3)=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, maybe I should number it correctly. Let me think. Nona is nine carbons. Position 1 is the first carbon, so position 2 is the start of a double bond, between 2 and 3. Then another double bond at positions 6 and 7, right? So the structure is:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
