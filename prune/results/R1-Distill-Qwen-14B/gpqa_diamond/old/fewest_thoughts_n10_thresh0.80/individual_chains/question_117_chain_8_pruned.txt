Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are mirror images of each other and can't be superimposed. That usually happens when there's a chiral center, right? Or maybe in some other cases like with allenes or certain stereogenic elements.

The question gives four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' positions. The substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and the nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Wait, so each ring has a nitro group and a carbonyl ester group. Are there any chiral centers here? Let me think. Biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality, which is a type of stereoisomerism where the two rings are connected in a way that they can't rotate freely, leading to different configurations. So if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, like if the groups around the central bond are arranged so that the two rings are mirror images, then it would have optical isomers. So yeah, this one probably does. Because the arrangement around the single bond connecting the two benzene rings (the biphenyl axis) can create axial chirality. Especially with bulky groups in certain positions, which they have here: two nitro groups and two ester groups. So I think 1 does have optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure here is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO- with a methyl ester. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COO-. No, wait, wait. Let me get the structure right. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, numbering the carbons: the first is the COOH, then the second is the middle, and third is CH3. So 2-hydroxy would be the middle carbon. So structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 as the methyl ester. Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be O=C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-something? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it out
