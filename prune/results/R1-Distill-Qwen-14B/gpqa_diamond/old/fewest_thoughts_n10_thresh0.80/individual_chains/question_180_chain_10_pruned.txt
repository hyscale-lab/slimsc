Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The problem is about electric potential energy, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. And the question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. Wait, so the system is isolated, so no external work is done, I guess. But since all the charges are either at point P or fixed at 2m away, maybe the potential energy is the sum of the interactions between each pair?

Wait, but wait. In systems with multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So each pair contributes to the total. But wait, since each charge is 2e, the potential energy between two charges would be (k * q1 * q2) / r.

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the 13th charge, and also, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from each other? Or are they arranged in some way?

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So point P is where the 13th charge is. So each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P. But how are they arranged relative to each other? Are they all at the same point 2m from P, or are they points on a sphere around P?

Wait, it says "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So each of them is at 2m from P. So maybe they're all on a sphere of radius 2m around P. So the distance between any two of these 12 is the distance between two points on the sphere of radius 2m. But wait, unless they're all at the same point, which would make the distance zero, but that's probably not the case because then the potential energy would be undefined due to infinite repulsion.

Wait, perhaps in the minimal energy configuration, the charges arrange themselves as far apart as possible, given the constraints. So maybe they form a regular dodecahedron or something. But since the problem is about the minimum energy, perhaps it's when all the 12 are as far apart as possible.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the minimum potential energy of the system. Wait, but like charges repel each other, so to minimize the potential energy (because all are positive charges?), wait no. Wait, wait, each charge is 2e, which is positive because e is positive. So same charges repel each other, so the potential energy would be positive. Wait, but wait, wait. Potential energy between two like charges is positive because it's repulsive. So the system's potential energy is the sum of all the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration where the charges are placed as far apart as possible to minimize the repulsion, hence the potential energy. But wait, if the charges are fixed at a certain distance from P, how can they affect their mutual distances?

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but arranged in a way that they are as far apart as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are not considered, and only the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th charge at P matter. Or perhaps the 12 charges are at points that are 2m from P, but their mutual distances are negligible? Or perhaps it's modeled as each of the 12 charges interacting with the central charge,
