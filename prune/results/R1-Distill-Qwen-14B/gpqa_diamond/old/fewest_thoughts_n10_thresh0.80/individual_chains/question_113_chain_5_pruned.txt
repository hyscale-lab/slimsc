Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can do.

Alright, the question provides three different characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Each of these gives some clues about the structure of the compound. Let me go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, I remember that alcohol O-H is usually a broad peak around 3300, but sometimes it can be lower, especially if it's a conjugated system or something. Also, the presence of a broad peak at 3000 might suggest something else, maybe an N-H stretch? No, wait, the options are all oxygen-containing compounds, so maybe O-H is more likely.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 is a bit lower, which might be another carbonyl group or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic C=C stretch? Wait, but in FTIR, the 1650 region can also be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an acid. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not.

So if there are two carbonyl peaks, that might mean two different types of carbonyl groups. Wait, but that's not possible because the options have either one or two oxygen atoms. For example, options with O2 would have two oxygen atoms. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups or something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Like, 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 might be an aromatic C=C stretch. But wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1600 cm^-1. Or maybe an N-H bend or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are several peaks, including ones corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have at least one double bond, perhaps in a vinyl group. So maybe an alkene is present.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. That's an important clue for determining the molecular formula. Let me think: what fragments could give m/z 45? Common fragments like CH3CO (which has a mass of 43) or maybe something else. Wait, 45 is another number. Let's see, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) + 16 (O) + 15 (CH3) = 46? Wait, no, 15+16+15 is 46. Hmm, so maybe a fragment of (CH3)2O is 46. Alternatively, maybe a different fragment.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion of something smaller. Let's think of the possible molecular formulas given the options. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Wait, the molecular formula would have a molecular weight. Let me compute each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular formula: 6*12 + 12*1 + 2*16 = 72 +12 +32= 116.

Option B: C6H10O. 6*12=72 +10=10 +16= 98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32= 114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72+12=84 +16=100.

So the molecular weights are 116, 98, 114, 100.

The mass spectrum's fragment peak is at 45. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, if the compound has an ester group, maybe the fragment comes from the ester part. Or perhaps a ketone.

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O? No, that's 46. Or maybe (CH2O) is 30, but 45 is 45. Hmm, perhaps a CH2CH2O group? Not sure. Alternatively
