Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that's the temperature a planet would have if it's in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it gets from the star and its own reflection.

The question gives me a bunch of data. Let me jot down the important points.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. So it's a bit more massive and bigger than the Sun, but the effective temperature is similar—since the Sun is about 5778 K, so 6300 is a bit hotter.

Planet1: 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii.
Planet2: 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii.

Both have same albedo, so that won't affect the ratio. They're in circular orbits, so Kepler's laws should apply straightforwardly.

The transit method and radial velocity are mentioned, but maybe that's just setting the scene. The RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The problem gives me the shifts for each planet in the [OI] line.

Wait, Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å. But how does that relate to their orbital parameters? Oh, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K, which depends on the planet's mass and distance from the star.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is: K = [ ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^0.5 ) )^(1/3) ) * sin(i) ) ] / ( (1 AU)^0.5 * (1 year)^-1 )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the planet's orbital period and semi-major axis. Oh, right, the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet )^(2/3) ) * (1 / c )

But since the planets have the same star, maybe we can relate their semi-major axes and masses through the RV shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, a1 and a2.

Because the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_planet) / a )^(1/3) * (1 / (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So, K ≈ ( (G * M_planet )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * (a^(1/3)) * (1 c ) ) )

Wait, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3)) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) ] / ( (a (1 - e^2 )) )^(1/2) )

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think of another approach.

I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K for a planet is given by:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) * ( (4π² / P² )^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/c )

Wait, maybe another approach is better. The RV amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the star's velocity. The formula is:

K = ( (27.4 m/s)
