Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So, for an operator O, it's ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

Breaking it down, the operator here is a sum of two terms: 10σz and 5σx. So the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term.

Let me first find the expectation value of σz, then multiply by 10, and do the same for σx multiplied by 5, then add them together.

But wait, since the given state is a linear combination, I should probably calculate each part separately.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me verify that this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.

Calculating: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are easy. For σz, the eigenvalues for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are +1 and -1, respectively.

Let me compute ⟨σz⟩ first. The expectation value is:

⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1)
Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you have a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1).

So, a is 0.5, so |a|² is 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|² is (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value of 10σz would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for σx. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates for σx are different; they're not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Wait, but in this case, the state is given in terms of σz eigenstates, so I can't directly compute the expectation
