Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

There's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Hmm, I remember that in magnetic fields, the energy levels of a spin-1/2 particle are quantized. When the magnetic field is along a certain direction, say z, the spin states are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to their magnetic quantum numbers.

Wait, but in this case, the field is switched from z to y. So the system's Hamiltonian must change. Initially, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz, but after the switch, it becomes proportional to Sy.

Let me think about the time evolution. When the magnetic field is along z, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are |+z> and |-z>. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so the energy levels are E = -mu * B, but since B is along z, E = -gamma S_z B.

But when the field is turned off and turned along y, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -gamma B S_y. Oh wait, because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via H = -mu · B. So since mu is gamma S, H becomes -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of B. So for the y-direction, H' = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, no, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z initially, but after the field is along y, the magnetic moment would still be mu = gamma S, but in the direction of the field, which is y. So the interaction energy is -mu · B. So H' = -gamma S_y B. Because mu is gamma S, and the dot product with B (which is in y) gives gamma S_y B.

Wait, maybe I should write it as H = -gamma B S_y. Because when the field is along y, the dot product would be mu · B = gamma S · B. So yes, H = -gamma B S_y.

Now, the important part is the time evolution after this Hamiltonian change. The system was initially in an eigenstate of H_initial (which was along z), but now the Hamiltonian is H' = gamma B S_y (I might have messed up the sign, let me double-check. Oh wait, the energy is H = -mu · B. So mu is along the spin direction. If B is along y, then mu · B is gamma S_y B. So H = -gamma B S_y. But wait, the energy is negative, but the actual Hamiltonian's matrix elements depend on the operator.)

Wait, maybe I should not get too bogged down with the signs right now. The key point is that after the field is switched, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So
