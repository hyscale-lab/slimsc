Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. 

The question says the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of this black hole.

Wait, entropy of a black hole... Oh right! I remember that the entropy (S) of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon, and the constants are Planck's, gravitational, and Boltzmann's. So the first step is to find the area A.

But how do I get the area from the angular size? I think I remember that the event horizon's radius (R) can be found using the angular size formula. Angular size θ is approximately equal to R/d, when θ is in radians. Oh wait, right, because for small angles, θ (in radians) ≈ opposite side (which is R) divided by the adjacent side (distance d).

So R ≈ θ * d. But θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert it to radians first. Let me see, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 10^-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17) * (3.1416/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then R = θ_rad * d. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, what's a parsec in meters? I think 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 3.086e16 m * 1e10 = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = θ_rad * d = (1.745e-19) * (3.086e26) ≈ Let me calculate that. 1.745e-19 * 3e26 is approximately 5.235e7 meters. Wait, wait, 3e26 is the d? Oh yeah, because 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. So 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 is about 5.37e7 meters. Wait, let me compute it more accurately: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.37. So R ≈ 5.37e7 meters? That's about 5.37e7 meters, or 5.37 x 10^7 meters. 

Wait, but
