Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When measuring the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the total probability of finding the particle in a region should be 1 (or 100%). Since all particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Oh wait, maybe I misread. Oh no, no, the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but wait, that can't be right because the wave function is usually a complex number, but its form would typically have a modulus squared. But the way it's written here, perhaps it's a real function minus an imaginary term. Oh wait, no, actually, the wave function is supposed to be a complex function, but the way it's written may just be a typo or perhaps it's meant to be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some exponential or something else. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-express it.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, that's a complex function. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5)i.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy the condition that the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from -infty to +infty equals 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3
