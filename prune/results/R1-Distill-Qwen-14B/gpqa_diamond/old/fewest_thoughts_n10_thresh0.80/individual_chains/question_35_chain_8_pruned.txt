Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c · S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a specific matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

I remember that for angular momentum operators, especially spin, the components are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, right? So S must be one of them. Let me recall: the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. 

The matrix S given here is:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0
Wait, that looks familiar. Let me think: σ_y is usually written as [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Yes! So S must be σ_y, the Pauli Y matrix.

So A_y = c * σ_y. And c is h/(4π). 

Now, the problem asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Hmm. Eigenvalues of a matrix operator are found by solving det(A_y - λI) = 0. But since A_y is proportional to σ_y, maybe I can just find the eigenvalues of σ_y and then multiply by c.

What are the eigenvalues of σ_y? I think they're ±1. Because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1. So the eigenvalues of σ_y are 1 and -1.

So then the eigenvalues of A_y would be c times those. So λ = c * 1 = h/(4π) and λ = c*(-1) = -h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator (which A_y should
