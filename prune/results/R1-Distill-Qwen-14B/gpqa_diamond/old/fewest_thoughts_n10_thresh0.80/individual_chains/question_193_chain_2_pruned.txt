Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs, so distance d is 1/plx. That makes sense.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to find how N changes with distance r, where r is the distance. Since d is distance, let's use r for distance. So r is proportional to 1/plx because plx = 1/r. So plx = 1/r, meaning r = 1/plx.

Wait, so plx is 1/r, so I can substitute that into the equation. Let's see: N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5. So 1/(plx^5) becomes 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which is (r^5)/(1) ) because 1 over (1/r)^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me get that substitution right. Let me write plx as (1/r). So N = k * (1/(plx)^5) = k * (r^5). So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, that's about the rate of change of N with respect to r. So dN/dr would be proportional to r^4 because the derivative of r^5 is 5r^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm, phrasing is a bit tricky here. Let me think. If N ∝ r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the change in N would be the derivative. So dN/dr = 5 *
