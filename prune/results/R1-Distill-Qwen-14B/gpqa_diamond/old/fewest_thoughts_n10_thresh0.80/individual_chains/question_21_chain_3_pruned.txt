Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It defines constitutional isomers as having the same molecular formula but different structures, and stereoisomers as having the same structure but different spatial arrangements. Then, the question is in two parts, A and B.

Part A asks which of the given compounds does not show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which one doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Part B is about optical isomerism. The options here are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. I need to determine which one shows optical isomerism.

Alright, let's tackle part A first.

I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in bonding, leading to different structures. For example, in ketones, if there's an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group), tautomerism can occur, leading to enol forms. But if there are no alpha hydrogens, that can't happen.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic structure with two ketone groups, right? Wait, no, quinones have two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. So, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Now, does benzoquinone have alpha hydrogens? The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups would be the ones attached to the benzene. If the benzene is a ring, the carbons next to the ketone are part of the ring. Benzene rings are aromatic, so the carbons in the ring are sp² hybridized. If the carbonyl is at position 1 and 4 (for 1,4-benzoquinone), then the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 3) are part of the ring. Wait, but if the carbonyl is at position 1, the adjacent carbons are positions 2 and 6 (if it's a benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 4). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about whether the carbonyl groups are conjugated with the ring. If the carbonyl is attached to the ring, the adjacent carbons (alpha to carbonyl) are part of the aromatic ring. So, the alpha positions would be the ring carbons. But in aromatic compounds, the ring carbons are already involved in conjugation, and there are no hydrogens in the alpha positions because they're all part of the ring. Wait, no, that's not right. Benzene rings have all carbons with one hydrogen each, but if a carbonyl is attached, like in acetophenone, the carbonyl is attached to a methyl group and a benzene ring. The alpha position (the carbon next to carbonyl) would be the benzene ring carbon, but in that case, the ring carbons don't have hydrogens attached. Wait, no, benzene carbons have one hydrogen each. So, perhaps in benzoquinone, the positions adjacent to the carbonyl groups don't have hydrogens because they're all part of the ring.

Wait, another approach: if a compound has no alpha hydrogens, it can't undergo tautomerism. So, benzoquinone: each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which are sp² hybridized. So the question is, do those adjacent carbons have any H's?

In benzene, each carbon has one H
