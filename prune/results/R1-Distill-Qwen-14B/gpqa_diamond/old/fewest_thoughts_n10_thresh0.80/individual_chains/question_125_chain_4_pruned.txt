Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². I remember that in quantum mechanics, such a potential is a common problem, especially in harmonic oscillators.

The first part of the question asks for the energy of the third excited state. The second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, let's start with the energy. I think the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each dimension. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy should depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, right, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or wait, actually, no, in three dimensions, each direction contributes, so the total energy is the sum of each direction's energy. For each direction (x, y, z), the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that direction. So adding them up, E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So n is the total number of quanta in all three directions.

Wait, but wait, another way to think about it: for each dimension, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So the total energy is the sum of each of these. So for 3D, E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Alternatively, sometimes the total quantum number is used, like n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = (n
