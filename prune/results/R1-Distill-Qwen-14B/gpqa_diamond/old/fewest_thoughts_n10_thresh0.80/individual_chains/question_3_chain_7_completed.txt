Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a given spin state. 

Alright, let's read the problem again. The particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, wait. I should make sure that the coefficients are correct. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Wait, does that add up to 1 in terms of probabilities? Let me check: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. Adding those gives 1, so the state is normalized. Good, that's correct.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. So I need to compute the expectation value of this operator in the given state. 

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. Since this operator is a sum of σz and σx multiplied by constants, I can break it down into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Then, I can add them together to get the total expectation value.

Wait, actually, right, because expectation is linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each part separately and then combine them.

First, let's tackle ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are straightforward. The σz operator in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ has diagonal entries 1 and -1, respectively. Because σz|↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

So the state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Let's compute that.

|a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the contribution from 10σz is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the other part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, specifically the states (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value directly.

The expectation value of σx in state |ψ⟩ is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, I remember that for a spin-½ particle in a state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (a b* - a* b) / (i) * something? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, let me think another way. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So when I have a state |ψ⟩ = [a, b]^T (since |↑⟩ is [1,0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0,1]^T), then the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is a* b + b* a. Wait, let me be precise. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

So |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] * σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ]

Alternatively, since all coefficients are real here, it's easier. So:

= (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) 

Because σx has 1's in the off-diagonal. Let me compute this. Each term is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3)/4). So two terms sum to sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, because 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4), and the same for the other term. So sum is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Therefore, the contribution from 5σx is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*(0.8660) ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding the two contributions: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait a minute. That can't be right because looking at the options, the closest is option C) -0.7, which is approximately -0.67.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the computation of ⟨σx⟩.

Wait, let me recast the problem. The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt{3}/2)|↓⟩. So in vector form, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The Pauli matrices:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]

So the expectation is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] σx [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

Let me compute σx acting on |ψ⟩:

σx |ψ⟩ = [0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 +0*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] ⋅ [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So compute 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is indeed sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.8660.

So 5 * sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 4.3301.

So the total expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 +4.3301 = -0.6699.

Which is approximately -0.67. So up to one decimal place, that would be -0.7 because the next digit is 6, which is more than 5, so we round up.

Wait wait, wait. Let me think again. If the value is -0.6699, up to one decimal place, it would be -0.7 because 0.6699 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6? Wait, no. No, wait. Because 0.6699 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimals. When rounding to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal. So 0.6699 would be 0.7 because the second digit is 6, which is >=5, so we round the first decimal up. So yes, -0.67 rounds to -0.7 at one decimal place.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. For the given state \( |\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1)
\]

Substituting \( |a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \):

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

Thus, the contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:

\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented as:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]

For the state \( |\psi\rangle = [0.5, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}]^T \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle
\]

Expanding this:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

Thus, the contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \approx 5(0.866) = 4.33
\]

### Step 3: Combine Contributions
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, this becomes \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
