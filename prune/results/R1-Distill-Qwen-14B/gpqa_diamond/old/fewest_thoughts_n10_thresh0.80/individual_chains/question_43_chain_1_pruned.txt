Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about determining the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I remember that IUPAC nomenclature involves numbering the substituents to get the lowest possible numbers. So the goal is to find the correct numbering that leads to the substituents having the lowest possible locants.

Alright, let's parse the description. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Oh wait, meta means each is separated by one carbon, right? So if one substituent is in position 1, the others would be in 3 and 5. But wait, the description says all three are meta to one another. Hmm, how does that work? Let me think. For three substituents to be meta, they need to be positioned each two carbons apart, but on a benzene ring that's six-membered, three substituents meta would probably form a sort of triangle. Like positions 1,3,5. Yeah, that makes sense. So the three groups—carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and cyano—are at positions 1,3,5 in some order.

Wait, but the question continues. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So the carboxylic acid is at
