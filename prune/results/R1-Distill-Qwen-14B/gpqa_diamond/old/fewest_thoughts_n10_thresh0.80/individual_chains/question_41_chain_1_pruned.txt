Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass medium. Let me try to break this down. Hmm, the question is about finding the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Oh, and the index of refraction is n. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, which is convenient.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n. So in the glass, the speed should be 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving. So does that affect the observed speed of the light? Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, in relativity, you can't just add velocities as you would in classical mechanics.

But wait, this is about light in a medium. So maybe it's a bit different. Let me think. When a medium is moving, how does that affect the speed of light in that medium as observed in another frame?

In special relativity, when you have a frame moving relative to another, velocities are transformed using the Lorentz transformation. The formula for velocity addition is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but wait, that's when you're looking at the velocity of an object moving at u in a frame moving at v relative to your own frame.

Wait, but in this case, the medium itself is moving. The light is propagating through the medium, which is moving. So perhaps I should consider the speed of light in the medium in its rest
