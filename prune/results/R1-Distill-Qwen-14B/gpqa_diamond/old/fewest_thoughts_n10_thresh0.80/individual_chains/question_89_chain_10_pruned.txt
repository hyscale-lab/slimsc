Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Or opposite? Well, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons 1 and 3, which are adjacent in the adamantane structure.

Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with a base, it's likely an elimination reaction. So probably forming an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. So the product should be an adamantyl compound with a double bond.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules when treated with a strong base. The product would be 1,3-diamantadiene or something similar? Or maybe a diene. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that doesn't fit with an alkene elimination. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about elimination vs substitution. Oh, wait, but KOH is a base, so substitution would require more of a SN2 mechanism. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, alternatively, maybe the KOH leads to dehydrohalogenation, making a diene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe elimination leads to a carbonyl? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the initial product is not an alkene.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane and it's treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination, but forming a ketone? No, wait, elimination typically forms alkenes or maybe in some cases, like in the formation of epoxides, but that's with peracids.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, with four fused cyclohexane rings. If the 1 and 3 positions are brominated, which are adjacent or across?

Alternatively, maybe when KOH is used, it's a substitution reaction. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would require two KOH molecules. But the product's IR shows a carbonyl, which would suggest a ketone or maybe an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually gives alkenes.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But how would that form? Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: look at the NMR data of product 1. The 1H NMR is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet integrating for 2H. That might be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Because 4.79 is upfield for a CH2 that's next to something. If it's a ketone, that might not make sense, but maybe a methylene adjacent to an ester or an ether.

Wait, but wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with a carbonyl group, such as a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the NMR doesn't show any signals around 9-10 ppm which would be aldehyde protons. So maybe it's a ketone or an ester.

If product 1 is a ketone, then the NMR would have a singlet at around 2.1 ppm for a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but product 1's NMR shows 1.94 (2H), which is around 2 ppm. So maybe that's the CH2 next to the carb
