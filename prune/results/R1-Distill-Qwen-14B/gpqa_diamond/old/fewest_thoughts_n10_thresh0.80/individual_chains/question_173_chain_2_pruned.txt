Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and an electron's energy. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved here. Let me think.

The question says the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. They want the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So first, I need to find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Since Δx is given as 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. Let me plug that in.

Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx) → wait, no, the uncertainty product is ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty is when we take the equality. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

Calculating Δp: ħ is about 1e-34, and Δx is 0.1e-9 m.

So Δp = (1e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) → wait, 2 * 0.1e-9 is 0.2e-9, which is 2e-10.

So Δp ≈ 1e-34 / (2e-10) → 1e-34 / 2e-10 = (1/2) * 1e-24 → 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. So 2 * 0.1e-9 is 0.2e-9, which is 2e-10? No, wait 0.1e-9 is 1e-10. So 2 * 1e-10 is 2e-10. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.

So Δp = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) m.

Wait, 0.1e-9 is 1e-10 meters. So 2 * 1e-10 = 2e-10. So Δp is (1.05e-34) / (2e-10) → approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the uncertainty in momentum relates to the uncertainty in energy. But wait, energy is related to momentum through the kinetic energy formula. Since the electron's speed is given, but we have Δp, how does that tie in?

Wait, the question is about the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. Hmm. So perhaps I need to find the uncertainty in kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

But when there's uncertainty in p, Δp, how does that affect ΔE? Oh
