Okay, let's try to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question seems a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Not too cold, so maybe B is something that's a solid at that temperature. 

Then, it says that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Also, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. 

I think I'll start by figuring out what substance X could be. Since X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, maybe it's something like NaOH, KOH, or another strong base. But wait, another thought: sometimes in organic reactions, metals like Mg, Li, or Na are used. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a Grignard reagent? Oh, but Grignard reagents are compounds like RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group and X is a halogen. But wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps it's a metal that has a common and a heavier isotope. Let's think about metals: for example, sodium (Na) has isotopes, but the heavier ones are maybe not so common. Potassium (K) has isotopes, like K-39, K-40, K-41. K-40 has a longer half-life, so it's considered a heavier isotope. Wait, but I'm not certain yet.

Looking at the reaction with Y. Let's think about what Y could be. Liquid Y reacting with X. If X is a metal, Y could be water, maybe? Or perhaps an acid. Wait, the reaction releases gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, gas W is probably something like H2, but wait, H2 has 1 proton and 0 neutrons in each molecule, or wait, maybe another gas. Let me think: a molecule where number of protons equals number of neutrons. Let's see, H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (wait, no, H2 is just two H atoms, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons). So H2 molecule's total protons would be 2, neutrons 0. So that's not equal. So that's probably not it.

What about O2? O has 8 protons. O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8, so 2 atoms make 16). Neutrons per O atom: O is usually O-16, which has 8 neutrons. So per O2 molecule, 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh, wait, that fits! So W could be O2. But wait, when would X react with Y to produce O2? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe gas W is something else. Let's think about other diatomic gases. What about something with a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about other gases like CO2, but that's triatomic. Alternatively, maybe NH3, but that's not a gas in the reaction.

Wait, another approach: maybe gas W is CO2? No, because each CO2 molecule has 12 protons (C) + 16 (O) *2? Wait, no, CO2 has 1 C (6 protons) and 2 O (each 8 protons), so total protons = 6 + 16 = 22. Neutrons: C is usually C-12 (6), O-16 has 8 each. So CO2 has (6 + (8*2)) protons and (6 + (8*2)) neutrons. So 22 each. So W could
