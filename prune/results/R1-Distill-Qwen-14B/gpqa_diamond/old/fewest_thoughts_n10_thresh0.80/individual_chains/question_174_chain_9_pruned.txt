Okay, so I've got this physics problem about atomic nucleus fission, and I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy and the classical approximation. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step.

Alright, so the initial nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Wait, 300 GeV is a lot. I remember that 1 GeV is about 1e9 eV, so 300 GeV is 3e11 eV. But the question is about MeV, so I'll have to convert units later.

The nucleus splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. So let me denote the rest masses. Let me think: let the mass of the lighter fragment be m. Then the heavier is 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m. The problem says this sum is 99% of the initial mass M. Oh wait, the initial rest mass is M, and the sum is 0.99M. So 3m = 0.99M → m = 0.99M /3 = 0.33M. So the masses are m =0.33M and 2m=0.66M. 

Wait, but M is the initial rest mass. So the initial rest energy is Mc² =300 GeV. So the rest energies of the fragments are (0.33M)c² and (0.66M)c². But the sum is 0.99M c², which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial energy is 300 GeV, and the rest energy after is 297 GeV. That means the energy released is 3 GeV, right? Because 300 -297=3 GeV. So the Q value for the fission is 3 GeV.

Wait, that's the total energy released. But how is this energy distributed between the kinetic energies of the two fragments? Because in an explosion (fission), the fragments fly apart with kinetic energy. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta, so their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

So, let's denote the velocities of the fragments. Since one is more massive, its velocity will be lower, I think. But because they are moving in opposite directions, their momentum must cancel.

Let me think in terms of relativistic energy. The total energy after fission is the sum of the two rest energies plus their kinetic energies.

But the total energy must include the kinetic energies. So, initial energy is Mc² =300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2) )= (m1 + m2)c² + (K1 + K2). But m1 +m2=0.99M, so (0.99M)c² + K1 + K2 =300 GeV.

Wait, because Mc²=30
