Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B, each leading to product A and B respectively. I need to choose the correct option from the given choices.

Starting with Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+. Hmm, I remember that KH is a strong base, a potassium hydride, often used as a deprotonating agent. THF is a common solvent for such reactions, probably because it's inert and can form complexes with the base.

Looking at the structure of the starting material, it's a spiro compound. A spiro structure means two rings connected by a single atomâ€”in this case, the spiro center is the alcohol (OH) group on carbon 1, connected to a five-membered and a three-membered ring? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the spiro notation is [3.5], meaning one ring is three carbons and the other is five. So the compound is a nonane (nine carbons) with a double bond at position 5 and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at position 1.

Wait, the structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro rings are nonane, so the two rings must be a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring connected at carbon 1, which has the vinyl group and the hydroxyl group.

So the spiro structure would have a bridge where carbon 1 is connected to both rings. The molecule has a double bond at position 5. 

When treated with a strong base like KH, I'm thinking about possible elimination or enol formation. But wait, the reaction conditions are THF, then adding H+. So it's probably a deprotonation followed by some kind of acid work-up. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of annulation?

Wait, another possibility: the base may abstract a proton to form an enolate,
