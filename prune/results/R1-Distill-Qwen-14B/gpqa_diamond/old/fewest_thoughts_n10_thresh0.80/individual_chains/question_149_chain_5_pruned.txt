Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that there's a small peptidic compound synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what's expected. So, it's not like they're each partially splitâ€”so maybe not a coupling issue. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so that's not the cause.

Then, the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So, same molecular weight but two components. Same mass spec implies same formula, so same molecule. But why two peaks?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The mass spec would show a different mass for a precursor, right? Because the precursor would be the previous step before the actual product. But in the question, both peaks have same mass spec as the expected molecule. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so same mass spec. But in NMR, if it's a racemic mixture, the alpha protons would show as a singlet if they're in a symmetric environment. Wait, but the question says it's the same alpha-proton. Hmm. Enantiomers would have identical 1H NMR peaks, but maybe if the sample isn't pure, but is a racemic mix, would that cause double peaks? Or maybe in a diastereomer case, the NMR would show different shifts. Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks with same integral adding to 1H, same shift similar. If it's enantiomers, the NMR would only show one peak because they have the same environment. Unless the two enantiomers are not in a racemic ratio, but the question says same intensity in LC-MS. Hmm. Not sure yet.

Option C: Double coupling during amide formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe during the formation of an amide, two different bonds form, leading to some coupling. I'm not too familiar, but double coupling could lead to multiple peaks. But in the NMR, the two peaks are the same alpha proton but split. If it's a coupling issue, but the question says coupling pattern rules it out. So maybe C is not the answer.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But wait, in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe the diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment. Like maybe the substituents are in such a way that the alpha proton is similar. But then, would the integrals add up? If the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, their peaks would split each other. So for each diastereomer, the alpha proton would be a single peak, but since they're different, they would appear as two separate peaks. But in the NMR, the same alpha proton, so if each diastereomer has the same alpha
