Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and jot down what I know.

The problem is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a monobasic strong acid. We're given 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. The question is asking for two things: the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can react with a strong acid like HCl. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and Cl^- ions. Let me write out the reaction equation.

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. Right. Now, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present in 0.1 grams.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So, Fe = 55.85, each OH- is 17 (16+1). So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Wait, 0.1 / 106.85 is about 0.000936 mol.

Since the stoichiometry is 1:3, moles of HCl needed = 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

But wait, the HCl is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so the volume needed (V) is moles / concentration. So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have exactly 28.08. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough, considering rounding.

Wait, no—wait another thing. The question says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid". So I think the calculation for the volume is correct, but perhaps I should double-check the molar masses.

Wait, let me recalculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol
Each OH is 17.007 g/mol (since O is 16.00 and H is 1.008). So three OH groups would be 3 * 17.007 = 51.021. So total is 55.845 + 51.021 = 106.866 g/mol.

So 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.1 / 106.866 ≈ 0.000936 moles. That's correct.

So moles of HCl needed: 0.000936 * 3 = 0.002808 mol.

At 0.1 M, volume needed is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So the closest option is C, which is 28.05 cm³. But wait, why is there a difference? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should do the calculation more precisely.

0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.0009357 moles.
