Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the question. The problem involves a series of reactions leading to product 4, and I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in that product. Hmm, sounds a bit complex, but I'll take it one step at a time.

First, let's parse the starting materials and the reactions:

1. The first reactant is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I think that's a norbornene derivative because norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So, structure-wise, norbornene has two rings, and the substituent is on the bridgehead.

2. This is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. The reactants are probably undergoing some kind of elimination or substitution reaction. Sodium iodide is a good source of iodide ions, which can act as a nucleophile or maybe facilitate an elimination via the E2 mechanism.

Wait, the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let me visualize that. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds at positions 1,3. Then, at positions 5 and 6, each has a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is a CH2Br2 group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

So when these react, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is acting as a base or a nucleophile? Or maybe the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing some kind of elimination. Wait, because each substituent has two bromines on a methyl group, maybe they can undergo dehydrohalogenation. But since there are two bromines, perhaps each methyl group is a dihalide, so maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, which can eliminate to form an alkyne or a double bond. But wait, each substituent is already on a diene, so maybe the reaction is a coupling.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of the norbornene. Norbornene is a bicyclic diene, so when it reacts with another diene, perhaps it's doing a Diels-Alder reaction? But wait, the other molecule is a diene as well. Or perhaps it's an alkylation.

Wait, let me think again. Sodium iodide is present. The reaction is at elevated temperature. The starting material is a norbornene derivative with a tert-butoxy group. When this reacts with the dibromomethyl groups, perhaps it's an exchange reaction. The tert-butoxy is a good leaving group? Wait, tert-butoxide is a strong base, but in this case, it's an ether. Maybe the iodide is acting as a nucleophile. Oh wait, perhaps this is an example of an elimination reaction, like a E2, where the iodide abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups. Each of those has two Br atoms. So maybe each can eliminate HBr twice, forming a triple bond? Because eliminating two HBr molecules from a CH2Br2 group would give an alkyne, right? CH2Br2 → CH2 after eliminating 2 HBr → that becomes a triple bond if both adjacent carbons undergo elimination.

So if each substituent on the cyclohexene is a CH2Br2, then each can lose two HBr molecules, turning into a triple bond. So the 5,6 positions would have triple bonds instead of CH2Br2. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would become 5,6-diynyl or something?

Wait, but the reaction is done with 2 equivalents of that compound. So the starting norbornene has one substituent, and the other reagent has two substituents. So perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups from each equivalent reacts. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is undergoing some kind of ring-opening. For example, the norbornene has a bridge, and the reaction could cleave that bridge. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group under certain conditions. But wait, tert-butoxy is an ether; usually, they're not the best leaving groups. But if there's a strong base or a good nucleophile, perhaps it can leave. For example, in an SN2 reaction, but the structure of norbornene is such that the bridgehead (position 7) might not be very accessible for SN2.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is acting as a base, deprotonating something. But then what's the proton source?

Wait, let's think about the other molecule: 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2Br2 group. So each of those can potentially eliminate two equivalents of HBr. So each CH2Br2 would lose two HBr, turning into a triple bond.

Wait, but each CH2Br2 is on adjacent carbons (5 and 6). So if both eliminate, perhaps they form a triple bond between C5 and C6, but wait, that's already a single bond. So that might not be possible. Alternatively, each CH2Br2 would lose HBr twice, leading to a triple bond on each substituent.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Let me think again. Each substituent is a CH2Br2 attached to the cyclohexene
