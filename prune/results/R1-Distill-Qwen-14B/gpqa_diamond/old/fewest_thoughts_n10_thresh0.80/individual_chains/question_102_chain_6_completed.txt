Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the question involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup is about a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, I remember that bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the vector has two ORFs, the ligand and the receptor.

The vector setup details: The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh wait, IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor would be translated as a separate ORF after the ligand.

There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop with loxP, and between receptor and eGFP is a stop with lox2272. So these are probably to prevent read-through from one ORF to another.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, which makes sense as a loading control. But when they breed mice homozygous for the construct and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring's visualization under confocal doesn't show a green signal. Wait, the eGFP is the receptor's tag, right?

So the problem is that the eGFP isn't showing up. Let's think about the possible issues.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if they're expressed in the same cell, maybe autocrine? But the question is about expression in the same cell, I think. Not sure how this affects the expression in the Western blot. The blot showed proteins, but maybe in the mouse model, the expression is not happening? Or maybe the construct isn't being properly expressed in the right cells. Hmm.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't fluoresce. Because eGFP is fluorescent when the protein is properly folded and in the right place, usually the cell membrane for transmembrane proteins. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it might not be on the surface, so no green signal. But why wouldn't the Western blot show the receptor? Oh wait, in the Western blot, they would see the protein regardless of its localization, unless it's not expressed. So if the blot shows the protein, this might not explain it. Wait, but the question said that the Western blot is done after transfection to primary astrocytes. So perhaps the construct is expressed, but in the mouse model, maybe the expression isn't happening because of the Cre/Lox setup.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The vector is a bicistronic construct with loxP and lox2272 stops. So in the absence of Cre, the stops would prevent expression of the downstream genes. But when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites and allow expression.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, then the ORF is ligand followed by mCherry with a stop in a loxP cassette. Then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by eGFP with a stop in lox2272.

Wait, loxP is a site recognized by Cre. So in the vector, the setup is:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP stop cassette -> mCherry (but this is a fusion? Or is the ligand fused to mCherry? The question says the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. So ligand-mCherry. Hmm, maybe that's a tag.

Similarly, the receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP. So receptor-eGFP.

But the stops between ligand and mCherry are loxP, and between receptor and eGFP are lox2272.

In the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of the downstream parts. So without Cre, the ligand would not be expressed because the stop is in the way? Or is the ligand expressed because it's under the CBA promoter?

Wait, no. Let me think about bicistronic vectors. Typically, a bicistronic vector has two ORFs under a single promoter, separated by an IRES. Alternatively, it can have two separate promoters. But in this case, it's a single transcript with an IRES.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Then after the ligand, there's a stop with loxP. Then mCherry is after that. But the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed unless the loxP is excised, right? So the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry fusion? Or maybe the ligand is expressed with a stop, and mCherry is after, but only if the stop is removed.

Wait, the vector setup: It's a bicistronic vector with two ORFs. The first ORF is ligand, under CBA promoter, fused to mCherry. Then, after the ligand, there's a stop in a loxP cassette. Then the second ORF is the receptor, which is under IRES, and it's fused to eGFP. After that, another stop in a lox2272 cassette.

So without Cre, the ligand ORF has a stop after it, so only the ligand would be expressed, but the mCherry would be blocked. Similarly, the receptor would have a stop, so only the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is blocked.

But when Cre is present, like in the SOX10-Cre mice, the loxP sites would be recombined. So in the ligand region, the loxP stop is removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the way the vector is set up, could the expression be such that the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed only if the stop is removed, and similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

But the real issue is that in the mouse model, when they crossed with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't observed.

So, in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice, which are hemizygous. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, perhaps. So the Cre would excise the lox sites in those cells.

So for the ligand and receptor expression, the Cre would remove the stops. So ligand-mCherry would be expressed and receptor-eGFP would be expressed. So when they look for eGFP, why isn't it there?

The Western blot was done after transfection to astrocytes. So perhaps the construct is functional in vitro, but not in the in vivo model.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would cause a frameshift, so the eGFP isn't properly made. But if the fusion is in frame, then eGFP would be expressed. But if the stop is before eGFP, then maybe the eGFP isn't expressed. Wait, but if the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, after the receptor ORF, then when Cre recombines, the stop is removed, so the receptor-eGFP would be expressed.

But in the mouse model, which uses SOX10-Cre, which probably only activates in certain cells, like neural crest derivatives. So if the Cre isn't active, the stops remain, and only the first parts are expressed. But in the question, they did see expression in the Western blot, which was after transfection, meaning in vitro.

Wait, but the issue is when they breed the mice and cross with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't observed. So perhaps the construct isn't recombining correctly in the mice.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct, so the Cre would have to excise both loxP and lox2272 stops.

Alternatively, maybe the vector isn't correctly set up for expression in the mouse.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe the promoter is working. But if the enhancer is missing, perhaps the expression isn't happening. But why would the enhancer be missing in the construct? The question states that the ligand is under CBA promoter. Maybe the CBA promoter doesn't drive expression in the right cells, but the question says they're expressed in neural crest cells, which are the target.

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't working. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker promoter but allows for expression in a different way. But the question is about the eGFP not showing. So if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor-eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but in the vector, the receptor is at 3' end, after the IRES. So the expression would be: the CBA promoter drives transcription, the transcript includes the ligand ORF, then the stop, which is loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, and then the eGFP with a lox2272 stop.

Wait, no. Or perhaps the vector is set up with the CBA promoter driving the ligand, then the IRES is after the ligand, and then the receptor is under the IRES. So the IRES allows for internal initiation, so the receptor is expressed from the same transcript as the ligand.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the vector structure again.

The vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs in the same transcript. So the first ORF is the ligand, under the CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand, there's a stop with loxP. Then an IRES, and then the receptor ORF, which is followed by a stop with lox2272. So the transcript is ligand - stop (loxP) - IRES - receptor - stop (lox2272).

In the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry (since after the ligand comes the stop, but perhaps the stop is before mCherry? Wait, the question says the ligand is at 5' and fused to mCherry. So ligand-mCherry is a single ORF, and after that, a stop and loxP. Then, after the IRES, the receptor is fused to eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF (fused with mCherry) -> loxP stop -> IRES -> receptor ORF (fused with eGFP) -> lox2272 stop.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand-mCherry is expressed, but the receptor-eGFP is not because the stop is in place. When Cre is present, it recombines the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stops, so both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse model, the confocal doesn't show green. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector is in the mouse. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells, leading to the excision of the lox sites and expression of both ligand and receptor with their fluorescent tags.

So why no green signal? The issue might be that the eGFP isn't being expressed, perhaps because the lox2272 stop isn't being excised.

Wait, why would that be? Maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present. But the SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, which express the ligand and receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the lox sites are in a way that when Cre recombines, the stop remains. Or maybe the vector wasn't correctly recombined, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause a frameshift, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if the stop is removed, the ORF should read through.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that after the receptor, the stop is before eGFP. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed as part of the receptor ORF.

Hmm, maybe the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor. If not, a frameshift would occur, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But how would that happen?

Wait, the question says that the receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP. So the receptor's ORF is followed by eGFP. So if the fusion is in frame, then the receptor-eGFP would be a single protein. If not, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

So if the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor, then Cre would remove the stop, and eGFP would be expressed. But if it's not in frame, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question says the vector has the receptor ORF at the 3' and fused to eGFP. So it's a fusion protein.

So perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed. But if it's not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be properly translated.

So the problem could be that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor ORF, leading to no expression of eGFP. But wait, in that case, the eGFP wouldn't even be expressed after Cre recombination.

So in the mouse, after SOX10-Cre is active, the eGFP isn't expressed because the frames don't match. Hence, no green signal in the confocal.

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That seems to fit.

Another possibility is if the IRES isn't working, but I think the IRES is just for allowing separate translation of the receptor.

Alternatively, maybe the construct isn't correctly inserted into the genome, but the question says they are homozygous for the construct.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Perhaps the issue is that SOX10-Cre is not recombining the lox2272 site, but I think in the Cre/Lox system, loxP and lox2272 are different sites, but Cre can recombine any loxP site regardless of the partner. So if the vector has loxP and lox2272 sites, Cre would recombine both, removing both stops.

Hmm. So what's the real issue?

Let me think about the vector structure again. The ligand is at 5', under CBA promoter, and the stop is after it. The receptor is at 3', after IRES, with a stop. In the presence of Cre, both stops are removed.

So the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP is not observed. The Western blot was done on transfected primary astrocytes, meaning in vitro the construct works. So the issue is in the in vivo setup.

So why would the eGFP not be expressed in the mouse?

One possibility is that the SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed. But the construct is expressed in neural crest cells, which SOX10-Cre targets.

Another idea is that the construct is in a region that's not accessible to Cre, like if it's inserted in a heterochromatic region. But that's less likely given the question setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stop cassettes are in the wrong order. For example, the loxP site is in front of the mCherry, and lox2272 in front of eGFP. Cre recombination removes the stops, allowing expression.

But if the vector is set up so that without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, preventing mCherry expression, and the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, preventing eGFP.

When Cre is present, the stops are removed, so both mCherry and eGFP are expressed.

So if the eGFP isn't showing, perhaps the lox2272 stop isn't being excised, meaning Cre isn't acting on it. But why?

Wait, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site. Cre can recognize both, but sometimes lox2272 is used as a 'floxed' site that doesn't recombine unless a specific variant of Cre is used (like Dre or another recombinase). Wait, no, I think Cre can recombine lox2272 sites as well. So the presence of lox2272 shouldn't prevent recombination.

Wait a minute, perhaps the two lox sites are on the same DNA strand, making it impossible to recombine. Or perhaps the vector was designed with lox sites that can't be recombined by Cre.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses loxP and lox2272 in a way that requires different Cre variants. I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in opposite orientations, making recombination impossible. But that's getting a bit technical.

Alternatively, perhaps the two lox sites are in the same orientation and can be recombined, but the construct isn't set up correctly. Hmm.

But stepping back, the options suggest that perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the ORF isn't in frame. So, when the stop is removed, the reading frame shifts, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP. But that would only happen if the eGFP isn't properly in frame with the receptor.

So the correct answer would be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression, hence no green signal.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent tags mCherry and eGFP, respectively. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites prevent downstream expression in the absence of Cre. When Cre is introduced (via SOX10-Cre mice), the stops are excised, allowing expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusion proteins. However, in the mouse model, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on the lack of eGFP expression in the same cells where Cre is active (neural crest derivatives). This does not explain the absence of eGFP fluorescence.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell membrane and fluoresce. However, the Western blot showed protein expression, indicating that the receptor-eGFP is being synthesized and transported. This makes this option unlikely.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under an IRES, which allows internal ribosome entry for separate translation. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing or non-functional, as the Western blot confirmed expression in vitro.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the removal of the stop cassette by Cre would result in a frameshift, preventing proper translation of eGFP. This would explain the absence of the green signal in the confocal microscopy. This is the most likely explanation, as improper framing would disrupt eGFP expression even if the stop cassette is excised.

### Conclusion:
The absence of the green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the same reading frame, leading to a frameshift and failure to express eGFP.
