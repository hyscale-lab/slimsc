Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, there's a civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud who built a super fast spacecraft. They want to come to Earth. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super close to the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options suggest it could either be that they die before reaching, or somewhere around 70-80 years.

Wait, the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So if the trip takes more than 150 years from their perspective, the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. But the options don't have any numbers above 81, so maybe it's okay.

Wait, but wait, time dilation is a factor here. Because the spacecraft is moving at such a high speed, from Earth's frame of reference, the time would be longer, but from the astronaut's perspective, the time is shorter due to relativistic effects. No, wait, no, time dilation works such that moving clocks run slower. So from Earth's frame, the spaceship would take a certain time, but the astronaut would experience less time due to time dilation.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Time dilation is about how much time passes in the moving frame versus the stationary frame
