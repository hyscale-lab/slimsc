Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work it through. The question is asking which of the options has the highest density. The options are labeled a to d, and the choices are A to D.

First, let me read the question again carefully. It says: Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density? The options are:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

Wait, so each option is describing a planet with certain characteristics. I need to find which has the highest density.

Hmm, density is mass divided by volume, right? So density = mass / volume. So to find density, I need to know both the mass and the radius (since volume depends on radius). 

Let me think about each option one by one.

Starting with option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's mass is about 5.97 ×10^24 kg, and Earth's radius is about 6,371 km. So the density would be (mass)/(volume). But wait, Earth's density is known. I remember Earth's average density is around 5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as option b's given density. So option a would have a density similar to Earth, which is 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, the option says it's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius, so yes, same as Earth, so same density.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given directly here, so it's 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet's density is exactly 5.5. But wait, how does that compare to other options?

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density? Because composition affects density. If it's same composition as Earth, then yes, the density would be the same as Earth's. Wait, but wait—mass and radius are factors. If the mass increases, assuming same composition, how
