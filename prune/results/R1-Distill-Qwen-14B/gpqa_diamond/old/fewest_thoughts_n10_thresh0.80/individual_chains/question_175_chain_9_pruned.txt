Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, and the symmetry axis is along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. The problem is about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a lambda dependence.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis, the radiation should be dipole-like, perhaps a dipole antenna.

Wait, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a specific angular dependence. I think the power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is proportional to (sin theta)^2, right? Because the radiation is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180). So the function f would depend on sin theta squared.

But wait, the question says the function f is a function of lambda and theta. So f = some function of lambda multiplied by sin^2 theta, perhaps.

But the problem says the maximum power is A. So the maximum occurs where sin theta is maximum. So the maximum is when theta is 90 degrees, sin theta is 1. So the maximum value of f would be when sin theta is 1, so the maximum per solid angle is when the angle is 90 degrees.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees. So we need to calculate what fraction of the maximum power A is the power at theta=30.

So, the power per solid angle is f(theta) = (some factor depending on lambda) * sin^2 theta. But wait, for a dipole, the radiation pattern is given by the formula for the intensity, which is I =
