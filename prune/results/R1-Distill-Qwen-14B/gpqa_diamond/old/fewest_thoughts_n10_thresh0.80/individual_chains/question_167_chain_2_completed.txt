Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state. The formula is |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. And the normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is that of a Gaussian reference state.

Wait, right, so relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. So Gaussian states are easier to handle, I think. But how do I find tau?

I remember that for a single-mode Gaussian state, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the first and second moments, like position and momentum variances. But maybe in this case, the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state or maybe a coherent state? Or perhaps for the relative entropy, the reference state is the same as the Gaussian approximation of the given state.

Wait, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, and the reference Gaussian state would be, perhaps, a thermal state or maybe the closest Gaussian state to |psi>.

Alternatively, I think another approach is that the relative entropy between the state rho and the Gaussian state tau is the difference in their entropies. So to compute nG, I need to find the entropy of rho and the entropy of the best Gaussian approximation tau, then subtract.

But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Oh, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. But which Gaussian state? Hmm, maybe the question assumes that the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first moments as rho but Gaussian. Or perhaps it's the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho, which would be the best approximation.

Alternatively, maybe the reference state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state compatible with the same expectation values. I'm not entirely sure. But perhaps for this problem, the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state, which would have the minimal possible entropy for a Gaussian state under certain constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is defined as the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the Gaussian state that minimizes this difference. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought. The von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho). For a mixed state, this is higher than for a pure state. So if the state |psi> is pure, its entropy is zero. But wait, no, because rho here would be a pure state density matrix, so S(rho) would be zero. But then tau would be a Gaussian state, which might be mixed. So the relative entropy would be - [S(tau)].

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure, and S(rho) = 0. The reference Gaussian state tau could be the Gaussian state that is closest in some sense to rho. But if tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps it's a thermal state or a squeezed state or something else.

Wait, but if |psi> is a pure state, and tau is a Gaussian state, then the relative entropy would be the difference between S(rho) (which is 0) and S(tau). So del_b = [0 - S(tau)] = - S(tau). But wait, relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(tau) + Tr(rho ln tau) - Tr(tau ln rho). Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing different definitions. Let me get back.

Wait, the problem defines del_b as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). So trace(rho ln rho) is S(rho), the von Neumann entropy of rho. Similarly, trace(tau ln tau) is S(tau). So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau).

Wait, no. Because von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho). So if rho is pure, S(rho)=0. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that would result in a negative number. However, relative entropy is usually non-negative, but perhaps this definition is different.

Wait, but the question says "relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]". So it's S(rho) - S(tau) because trace(rho ln rho) is -S(rho), so del_b = (-S(rho)) - (-S(tau)) )= S(tau) - S(rho). Wait, that would be S(tau) - S(rho) if S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho).

Wait, let me clarify: von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho). So Tr(rho ln rho) = -S. So the expression del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau) = (-S(rho)) - (-S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho).

Wait, no, it's [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)] = (-S(rho)) - (-S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). So del_b is positive when S(tau) > S(rho).

But in this case, rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. So del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). So del_b equals the entropy of the Gaussian state tau.

But which Gaussian state is tau? Because different Gaussian states have different entropies.

Wait, in the problem, tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that is the closest to rho in some sense, like the one that minimizes the relative entropy. Or maybe tau is the Gaussian state that has the same first moments as rho. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the maximum entropy Gaussian state under some constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state, but that may not make sense here.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state compatible with the same first moments as the state rho. Because the maximum entropy state under given constraints is the Gaussian state. So if rho has some first moments, the maximum entropy Gaussian state would be the one with those first moments and minimal additional constraints. For a single-mode state, the maximum entropy Gaussian state would have the same first moments (like mean position and momentum) as rho and be the thermal state with the minimal possible entropy, perhaps.

But wait, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. The expectation values for position and momentum would be the same as the coherent state if phi is chosen such that the superposition has zero amplitude. Wait, no. Let me think.

The coherent state |alpha> has expectation values in position and momentum corresponding to alpha. Similarly, |-alpha> has expectation values in the opposite direction. So when you take a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, the expectation values would depend on phi.

Wait, the state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Let's compute the expectation values of the position operator x and momentum p.

The coherent states |alpha> have expectation values x = Re(alpha), p = Im(alpha). Similarly, |-alpha> has x = Re(-alpha) = -Re(alpha), p = Im(-alpha) = -Im(alpha).

So the state |psi> is a sum of cos(phi)|alpha> and sin(phi)|-alpha>. So the expectation value of x would be [ cos(phi)* Re(alpha) + sin(phi)* (-Re(alpha)) ] / N^2. Wait, because when you take <x>, it's <psi | x | psi>, which is (1/N²) [ <alpha| cos(phi) + (-alpha)| sin(phi) ] x [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ].

But since x is a real operator, and the cross terms would involve <alpha | x | -alpha >. Hmm, wait, but maybe the cross terms vanish because |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal except for some phase factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value of x in |psi> is zero? Let's see.

Let me compute <x>. The coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> have expectation values x = Re(alpha) and x = -Re(alpha), respectively.

The state |psi> is a linear combination. So <x> = [ cos^2(phi) Re(alpha) + sin^2(phi)(-Re(alpha)) + cross terms ] / N².

Wait, the cross terms involve cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha| x | -alpha> + < -alpha | x | alpha> ].

But what is <alpha | x | -alpha>?

The position operator x is proportional to (a + a†), where a is the annihilation operator. So <alpha | x | -alpha> = <alpha | (a + a†) | -alpha>.

We know that <alpha | a | -alpha> = - alpha* e^{something}... Wait, perhaps I should remember that <alpha|a|beta> = alpha beta* e^{-(|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2} e^{alpha beta*}.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but let me think of it this way: For a coherent state |beta>, a |beta> = beta |beta>, so <alpha| a |beta> = beta <alpha| beta>.

But wait, that's only if |alpha> and |beta> are coherent states. So <alpha| a |beta> = beta <alpha| beta>.

Similarly, <alpha | a† |beta> = alpha* <alpha| beta>.

So in this case, <alpha | a | -alpha> = (-alpha) <alpha | -alpha> = (-alpha) e^{-|alpha|^2} e^{alpha (-alpha)*} ?

Wait, because <alpha | -alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2} e^{ alpha (-alpha)* } = e^{-|alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2 } = e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

So <alpha | a | -alpha> = (-alpha) * e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

Similarly, <alpha | a† | -alpha> = (alpha* ) * e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

So putting it together, <alpha | x | -alpha> = (x0) [ (-alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2} + alpha* e^{-2 |alpha|^2} ] ), where x0 is the proportionality constant (sqrt(2 hbar / m omega) or something similar, but perhaps for calculation purposes, we can absorb it into the definition of alpha).

Wait, perhaps I can just compute the expectation value.

Wait, let me denote x0 as a constant. So x = x0 (a + a†). So <alpha | x | -alpha> = x0 [ <alpha | a | -alpha> + <alpha | a† | -alpha> ].

Which is x0 [ (-alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2} + alpha* e^{-2 |alpha|^2} ].

Hmm, let's write this as x0 e^{-2 |alpha|^2} ( alpha* - alpha ) = x0 e^{-2 |alpha|^2} ( - 2i Im(alpha) ).

So <alpha | x | -alpha> = -2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

Similarly, < -alpha | x | alpha> = <alpha | x | -alpha>^* = 2i x0 Im(alpha^*) e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

Wait, but Im(alpha^*) is -Im(alpha), so this would be -2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because ( - alpha ) is the parameter for |-alpha>, so when I compute < -alpha | x | alpha>, it's similar.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <x> in the state |psi>.

So <x> = [ cos(phi) <alpha | + sin(phi) < -alpha | ] (1/N²) [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ] multiplied by x.

Expanding this, the terms would be:

cos²(phi) <alpha|x|alpha> + sin²(phi) < -alpha |x| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha |x| -alpha> + < -alpha |x| alpha> ].

But <alpha|x|alpha> is x0 Re(alpha), and similarly < -alpha |x| -alpha> is x0 (- Re(alpha)).

So let's compute each term:

Term 1: cos²(phi) * x0 Re(alpha) / N².
Term 2: sin²(phi) * x0 (- Re(alpha)) / N².
Term 3: cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha|x|-alpha> + < -alpha|x|alpha> ] / N².

Now, the first two terms combine to x0 Re(alpha) [ cos²(phi) - sin²(phi) ] / N².

Similarly, the third term is cos(phi) sin(phi) [ ... ].

Wait, but perhaps there's a simplification. Let me compute all terms.

Wait, but perhaps for our specific case, with phi = -pi/4.

Wait, phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So cos(phi) is positive, sin(phi) is negative.

Let me plug phi=-pi/4 into the terms.

So term 1: ( (sqrt(2)/2)^2 ) * x0 Re(alpha) / N² = (0.5) x0 Re(alpha) / N².

Term 2: ( (-sqrt(2)/2)^2 ) * x0 (- Re(alpha)) / N² = (0.5) x0 (- Re(alpha)) / N².

So term1 + term2 = 0.5 x0 Re(alpha)/N² - 0.5 x0 Re(alpha)/N² = 0.

So the first two terms cancel each other.

Now, term3: cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha|x|-alpha> + < -alpha|x|alpha> ] / N².

We have cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So cos(phi) sin(phi) = (sqrt(2)/2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) )= - (2/4) )= -0.5.

So term3 = (-0.5) [ <alpha|x|-alpha> + < -alpha|x|alpha> ] / N².

Which is (-0.5) [ (-2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2}) + (2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2}) ) ] / N².

Wait, wait, let me compute <alpha|x|-alpha> and < -alpha|x|alpha>.

Earlier, I found that <alpha|x|-alpha> = -2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

Similarly, < -alpha |x| alpha> would be <alpha|x| -alpha>^*.

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

< -alpha |x| alpha> = x0 [ < -alpha | a | alpha> + < -alpha | a† | alpha> ].

a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>, so < -alpha | a | alpha> = alpha < -alpha | alpha> = alpha e^{- | -alpha |^2 - |alpha|^2} e^{ (-alpha) alpha* }.

Wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal, except when alpha=0. Wait, no, coherent states are not orthogonal unless |alpha|² is zero. So < -alpha | alpha> = e^{ - (|alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2) } e^{ (-alpha) alpha* }.

Which is e^{-2 |alpha|²} e^{- |alpha|²} because (-alpha) alpha* = -(alpha^2) ? Wait, (-alpha)(alpha*) is - |alpha|^2, because alpha* is the complex conjugate. So (-alpha)(alpha^*) = - (alpha)(alpha*) )= - |alpha|^2.

So < -alpha | alpha> = e^{- |alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2} e^{ - |alpha|^2 }? Wait, no. Wait, the inner product <beta | gamma> is e^{-|beta|^2 - |gamma|^2} e^{ beta* gamma }.

So < -alpha | alpha> = e^{- | -alpha |^2 - | alpha |^2} e^{ (-alpha)* alpha }.

| -alpha |^2 is same as |alpha|², so it's e^{-2 |alpha|²} e^{ - |alpha|² }, because (-alpha)* alpha = - |alpha|².

So < -alpha | alpha> = e^{-2 |alpha|²} e^{- |alpha|²} } = e^{-3 |alpha|²}.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed.

So < -alpha | a | alpha> = alpha < -alpha | alpha> = alpha e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

Similarly, < -alpha | a† | alpha> = alpha* < -alpha | alpha> = alpha* e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

So putting it together, < -alpha |x| alpha> = x0 [ alpha e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + alpha* e^{-3 |alpha|^2} ] = x0 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} (alpha + alpha* ) = x0 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} (2 Re(alpha)).

Wait, but earlier when I thought about <alpha |x| -alpha>, I got something involving Im(alpha). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha |x| -alpha>.

Wait, x = x0 (a + a†), so <alpha| x | -alpha> = x0 [ <alpha| a | -alpha> + <alpha | a† | -alpha> ].

I know that a | -alpha > = (-alpha) | -alpha >, so <alpha | a | -alpha > = (-alpha) <alpha | -alpha> = (-alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{ alpha (-alpha)* }.

Wait, alpha*(-alpha) is - |alpha|^2. So this becomes (-alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2} } = (-alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

Similarly, <alpha | a† | -alpha> = < (-alpha)| a | alpha>^*. Let me think. Wait, a† |alpha> = alpha^* |alpha>, so <alpha | a† | -alpha> = <alpha | alpha^* | -alpha> = alpha^* <alpha | -alpha>.

Which is alpha^* e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{alpha (-alpha)*} = alpha^* e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2} } = alpha^* e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

So putting it all together:

<alpha |x| -alpha> = x0 [ (-alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + alpha^* e^{-3 |alpha|^2} ].

Which is x0 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} [ -alpha + alpha^* ].

= x0 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} [ - (alpha - alpha^*) ].

= x0 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} [ -2i Im(alpha) ) ].

So <alpha|x|-alpha> = -2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

Similarly, < -alpha | x | alpha> would be <alpha | x | -alpha>^*.

Which is [ -2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} ]^* = 2i x0 Im(alpha^*) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

But Im(alpha^*) is -Im(alpha), so this becomes 2i x0 (-Im(alpha)) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} = -2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

So when I add <alpha|x|-alpha> + < -alpha|x|alpha>, I get:

-2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + (-2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} ) ) = -4i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

Putting this back into term3:

term3 = (-0.5) [ (-4i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} ) ] / N².

Which simplifies to (2i x0 Im(alpha) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} ) / N².

Now, the total expectation value <x> is term1 + term2 + term3 = 0 + 0 + term3.

But x is a real operator, so the expectation value should be real. But term3 here is imaginary. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the cross terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value <x> is zero because the terms cancel out.

Wait, let me think about the state again. The state is a symmetric superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, but with cos and sin coefficients. Let me see, when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2.

So the state is ( |alpha> - | -alpha> ) / sqrt(2) * N, since N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha^2 )).

Wait, with phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) is sin( -pi/2 ) = -1.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) exp(-2 alpha^2 )) = sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2 )).

With alpha = 0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935, so N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So the state is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2) | -alpha> ] / 0.627.

Wait, perhaps the expectation value of x is zero because the state is symmetric in a certain way.

Hmm, maybe I should calculate it differently. Let me consider the case when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the density matrix rho of the state |psi> and then find its entropy.

But the state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. Therefore, von Neumann entropy S(rho) is zero.

So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But the problem defines del_b as [ trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) ] = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau).

But relative entropy is usually a non-negative measure, but perhaps in this case, it's defined differently.

Wait, but if tau is a Gaussian state, and the state rho is non-Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be positive if the non-Gaussian state is more entropic than the Gaussian one. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, an alternative approach: perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as rho when it's Gaussian. But rho is a non-Gaussian state, so perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state that matches the first moments of rho.

Wait, but for a single-mode Gaussian state, the maximum entropy is achieved by the thermal state, which has the minimal possible entropy for given photon number or given average photon number.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state, which is a Gaussian state. But if |psi> is non-Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be the difference between zero and the entropy of the vacuum.

Wait, the vacuum state has entropy S(tau) = 0 (since it's pure), so del_b would be 0, but that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the relative entropy is calculated between the non-Gaussian state and a particular Gaussian state—like the two-mode squeezed state or something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the relative entropy is calculated using the closest Gaussian approximation. In some literature, the non-Gaussianity is measured by the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So in this case, tau would be the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy with rho.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state |psi> when it's Gaussian. But our state is non-Gaussian, so perhaps when it's Gaussian, it's a coherent state.

Wait, but the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, so when phi=0, it's just |alpha>, a coherent state. Similarly, when phi=pi/2, it's | -alpha >.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, it's a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is a non-Gaussian state. So the reference Gaussian state could be the thermal state with the same photon number distribution as |psi>, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is zero only when the state is Gaussian. Otherwise, it's positive. So for a Gaussian state, nG would be zero, but for a non-Gaussian state, it's positive.

Wait, but if rho is |psi> and tau is a Gaussian state, then del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = -S(tau). But that would be negative, which doesn't make sense for a relative entropy. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the other definition of relative entropy, which is S(tau||rho) = S(tau) - S(rho) + Tr(tau ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the definition where the non-Gaussianity is S(rho) - S(tau). But since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so nG= - S(tau). But then S(tau) would have to be negative, which is impossible, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem defines del_b as [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which would be S(rho) - S(tau). But since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b = - S(tau). But since S(tau) is always positive, del_b would be negative. But the options given are all positive numbers except D) 0.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the reference Gaussian state is the same as rho when rho is Gaussian. But rho is a pure state, so the reference Gaussian state would also have to be a pure Gaussian state, which is a coherent state. So tau would be |alpha> or |-alpha>, or perhaps a superposition that's Gaussian, but a superposition of coherent states is non-Gaussian, so perhaps the reference Gaussian state isn't a coherent state but something else.

Wait, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state, which is pure. So S(tau)=0, del_b = 0 - 0 = 0. So the non-Gaussianity would be zero, which would be option D. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps the problem's definition is swapped. Perhaps the relative entropy is Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho), so del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). Since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, del_b = S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity would be the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

But which reference Gaussian state? If the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum, S(tau)=0. Then nG would be zero, but that's impossible as the state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps tau is the maximum entropy Gaussian state that matches certain moments of rho, like the mean photon number. But without knowing which moments, it's hard to calculate.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to compute the density matrix of |psi> and then compute its von Neumann entropy.

The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

With phi = -pi/4, so cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So |psi> = (|alpha> - | -alpha> ) / sqrt(2) * N.

Wait, but N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )).

With phi=-pi/4, sin(2 phi) = sin( -pi/2 ) = -1.

So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2 )).

With alpha=0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2 )= exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So |psi> is (|alpha> - | -alpha> ) / (sqrt(2) * 0.627).

Which is (|alpha> - | -alpha> ) / (sqrt(2)*N).

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

To find the von Neumann entropy S(rho), which is zero because rho is pure.

So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau).

But this would be negative, but all the options are positive except D) 0.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the definition of the relative entropy. Maybe it's the other way around: del_b = S(tau) - S(rho), which would make sense because for a non-Gaussian state, the entropy would be higher than that of the Gaussian state if the Gaussian state is the maximum entropy state.

Wait, but if del_b is S(tau) - S(rho), and S(rho)=0, then del_b = S(tau).

But then I need to find the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau.

But what is tau? It's the Gaussian state that's being compared to rho.

But without knowing which Gaussian state it is, I can't compute S(tau).

Wait, perhaps I should think that the reference Gaussian state is the same as the one that rho would be if it were Gaussian. So for rho to be Gaussian, it would have to be a coherent state or something.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of rho. But in a single-mode case, the maximum entropy Gaussian state is the thermal state with the same photon number variance as rho.

But without knowing the photon number distribution, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero if the state is Gaussian, which would only be the case when the state is a coherent state. Since our state is a superposition (non-Gaussian), the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is 1.38, which is a reasonable number for the entropy of a Gaussian state.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state, which has zero entropy. But then del_b would be zero, which is option D.

But that doesn't make sense because the state is non-Gaussian. So perhaps D is not the right answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state with the same average photon number as rho.

Wait, to compute the average photon number for rho, which is the state |psi>, let's compute <n>, where n is the number operator.

But rho is a pure state, so <n> = <psi|n|psi>.

But maybe it's easier to compute <n> for the state |psi>.

The state |psi> is (|alpha> - | -alpha> ) / N.

So <n> = (1/N²) [ <alpha|n|alpha> + <alpha|n| -alpha> + < -alpha|n|alpha> - < -alpha|n| -alpha> ].

But <alpha|n|alpha> is |alpha|^2, and similarly < -alpha |n| -alpha> is |alpha|^2.

The cross terms are <alpha|n| -alpha> and < -alpha |n| alpha>.

What's <alpha|n| -alpha>?

n | -alpha> = (-alpha)(-alpha -1) | -alpha> = (alpha +1)(-alpha) | -alpha> ?

Wait, no, perhaps n |beta> = beta (beta - 1) |beta>.

Wait, no, the number operator n = a† a.

So n |beta> = beta a† a |beta> = beta (beta - 1) |beta>.

Wait, so <alpha | n | -alpha> = ( -alpha ) ( -alpha - 1 ) <alpha | -alpha>.

Which is ( (-alpha)(-alpha -1) ) e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{ alpha (-alpha)* }.

Which simplifies to ( alpha (alpha + 1) ) e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2} }.

= alpha (alpha + 1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

Similarly, < -alpha |n| alpha> = ( alpha (alpha -1) ) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

So putting it all together:

< n > = (1/N²) [ |alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2 + alpha(alpha + 1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + alpha (alpha - 1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} - |alpha|^2 ].

Wait, let me compute each term.

Term 1: |alpha|^2 (from <alpha|n|alpha>).
Term 2: <alpha|n| -alpha> = alpha (alpha +1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.
Term 3: < -alpha |n| alpha> = alpha (alpha - 1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.
Term 4: - < -alpha |n| -alpha> = - |alpha|^2.

So <n> = (1/N²) [ |alpha|^2 + alpha(alpha+1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + alpha(alpha -1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} - |alpha|^2 ].

Simplify inside the brackets:

|alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2 = 0.

The cross terms: alpha(alpha+1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + alpha(alpha-1) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} = alpha [ (alpha+1) + (alpha-1) ) ] e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

= alpha [ 2 alpha ] e^{-3 |alpha|^2} = 2 alpha^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

So <n> = (1/N²) * 2 alpha^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

With alpha=0.5, alpha^2=0.25. e^{-3*(0.25)} = e^{-0.75} ≈ 0.4724.

So the numerator becomes 2 * 0.25 * 0.4724 ≈ 0.2362.

Denominator N² is (0.3935) as calculated earlier, so N²≈0.3935.

So <n> ≈ (0.2362) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.600.

So the average photon number is about 0.6.

The thermal state with average photon number <n> has entropy S = ln( <n> + 1 ) - ( <n> / ( <n> + 1 )) ln( <n> ).

Wait, no, the entropy of a thermal state is S = ln( (n+1) ) - (n/(n+1)) ln(n), where n is the average photon number.

So for <n>=0.6, S = ln(1.6) - (0.6/1.6) ln(0.6).

Compute:

ln(1.6) ≈ 0.4700.

ln(0.6) ≈ -0.5108.

So (0.6/1.6) * (-0.5108) ≈ 0.375 * (-0.5108) ≈ -0.1915.

So S = 0.4700 - ( -0.1915 ) = 0.4700 + 0.1915 ≈ 0.6615.

So if the reference Gaussian state is a thermal state with <n> = 0.6, then S(tau) ≈ 0.6615.

But wait, this would lead to del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) = 0.6615 - 0 = 0.6615.

But this is not one of the options. The options are 0.25, 1.38, etc. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state, which has <n>=0 and S=0. So del_b would be 0, but the state is non-Gaussian, so nG should be positive.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy between the state and a Gaussian state with the same first moments.

But the state |psi> has <x>=0 as we saw earlier. So the reference Gaussian state would have <x>=0 and the same variance as |psi>.

Wait, the variance of x in rho would be Var_rho = <x²> - <x>². Since <x>=0, Var_rho = <x²>.

So compute <x²> for rho.

x = x0 (a + a†), so x² = x0^2 (a + a†)(a + a†) = x0² (a² + a a† + a† a + a†^2).

So <x²> = x0^2 [ <alpha| a² |alpha> + <alpha| a a† |alpha> + <alpha| a† a |alpha> + <alpha| a†^2 |alpha> - similar terms for the |-alpha> parts and cross terms ].

This seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the variance using the properties of coherent states.

The variance of x in a coherent state |alpha> is (x0^2)/2. Because Var = <x²> - <x>^2 = (x0^2)/2.

But when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the variance might increase.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> has a variance Var = (x0^2)/2 + something from the interferences.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute Var_rho = Tr(rho x²) - (Tr rho x )^2.

But rho is |psi><psi|, so Tr(rho x) = <x> = 0 as we saw earlier.

So Var_rho = Tr(rho x²) = <psi | x² | psi>.

But that's going to be a bit involved. Let me try to compute it.

<x²> = (1/N²) [ <alpha|x²|alpha> + <alpha|x²| -alpha> + < -alpha|x²|alpha> + < -alpha|x²| -alpha> + cross terms ].

Wait, actually, expanding |psi> as a sum:

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

So <x²> = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha|x²|alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha|x²| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|x²| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) < -alpha|x²| alpha> ].

We know that <alpha|x²|alpha> = x0² (2 |alpha|^2 +1 ), since for a coherent state, Var(x) = (x0²)/2, and <x> = x0 Re(alpha), so <x²> = Var(x) + <x>^2 = (x0²/2) + x0² |alpha|^2 = x0² ( |alpha|^2 + 0.5 ).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute x0² (2 |alpha|^2 +1 ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, x0 is the scaling factor for the position operator, where x = x0 (a + a†). So x0^2 = (2 hbar omega)/m. But perhaps for computational purposes, I can set x0^2 = 2 for simplicity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps x0 is 1 for simplicity, so x0^2 = 1.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without worrying about x0, as it might cancel out.

So for |alpha> and |-alpha>, <x²> is x0² ( |alpha|^2 + 0.5 ), I think.

So the terms become:

Term1: cos^2(phi) * x0² ( |alpha|^2 + 0.5 )
Term2: sin^2(phi) * x0² ( |alpha|^2 + 0.5 )
Term3: cos(phi) sin(phi) * x0² [ <alpha|x²| -alpha> + < -alpha|x²| alpha> ]

Term1 + Term2 = x0² ( |alpha|^2 + 0.5 ) [ cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) ] = x0² ( |alpha|^2 + 0.5 ) * 1 = x0² ( |alpha|^2 + 0.5 ).

Term3: cos(phi) sin(phi) x0² [ <alpha|x²| -alpha> + < -alpha|x²| alpha> ]

Hmm, but what's <alpha|x²| -alpha>?

x² = x0² (a + a†)^2 = x0² (a² + a a† + a† a + a†^2 )

So <alpha|x²| -alpha> = x0² [ <alpha| a² | -alpha> + <alpha| a a† | -alpha> + <alpha| a† a | -alpha> + <alpha| a†^2 | -alpha> ]

Compute each term:

1. <alpha| a² | -alpha> = < -alpha | a†^2 | alpha >^*.

But a² | -alpha> = (-alpha)^2 | -alpha> = alpha^2 | -alpha> .

So <alpha | a² | -alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha | -alpha> = alpha^2 e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{ alpha (-alpha)* }.

= alpha^2 e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2} = alpha^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

2. <alpha| a a† | -alpha> = <alpha| (a† a +1 ) | -alpha> = ( <alpha| a† a | -alpha> + <alpha| -alpha> ).

But <alpha| a† a | -alpha> = < -alpha | a a† | alpha> = < alpha | a† a | -alpha>^*.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using properties.

a a† = a† a + 1.

So <alpha| a a† | -alpha> = <alpha| a† a | -alpha> + <alpha| -alpha> = ?

But <alpha | a† a | -alpha> = < -alpha | a a† | alpha> = ?

Alternatively, perhaps a† | -alpha> = (-alpha)^* | -alpha> = (-alpha^*) | -alpha>.

So a† a | -alpha> = a† a | -alpha> = (-alpha^*) ( (-alpha) ) | -alpha> = |alpha|^2 | -alpha> .

So <alpha| a† a | -alpha> = |alpha|^2 <alpha| -alpha> = |alpha|^2 e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{ alpha (-alpha)^* }.

= |alpha|^2 e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2} } = |alpha|^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

And <alpha| -alpha> = e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{ alpha (-alpha)^* } = e^{-2 |alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2} } = e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

So <alpha| a a† | -alpha> = |alpha|^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + e^{-3 |alpha|^2} = ( |alpha|^2 +1 ) e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

3. <alpha| a† a | -alpha> = (-alpha)^* ( (-alpha) ) <alpha| -alpha> = |alpha|^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

4. <alpha| a†^2 | -alpha> = [ <alpha| a^2 | -alpha> ]^* = [ alpha^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} ]^* = (alpha^2)* e^{-3 |alpha|^2} = (alpha*)^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2}.

Putting all together:

<alpha|x²| -alpha> = x0² [ alpha^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + (|alpha|^2 +1 ) e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + |alpha|^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} + (alpha*)^2 e^{-3 |alpha|^2} ].

Factor out x0² e^{-3 |alpha|^2}:

= x0² e^{-3 |alpha|^2} [ alpha^2 + (|alpha|^2 +1 ) + |alpha|^2 + (alpha*)^2 ].

Combine terms:

= x0² e^{-3 |alpha|^2} [ (alpha^2 + (alpha*)^2 ) + 2 |alpha|^2 + 1 ].

But alpha^2 + (alpha*)^2 = 2 Re(alpha^2 ), and 2 Re(alpha^2) + 2 |alpha|^2 = 2 ( Re(alpha^2) + |alpha|^2 ) = 2 ( alpha^2 + (alpha*)^2 + 2 |alpha|^2 ) / 2 ? Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute numerically.

With alpha=0.5, which is a real number, so alpha=0.5, alpha^2=0.25.

So terms inside the brackets:

alpha^2 = 0.25,

(alpha*)^2=0.25,

|alpha|^2=0.25.

So:

0.25 (from alpha^2) + 0.25 (from (alpha*)^2) = 0.5.

Then + 2 * 0.25 = 0.5.

Plus 1 gives 1.5.

So <alpha|x²| -alpha> = x0² e^{-3*(0.25)} * 1.5 = x0² e^{-0.75} * 1.5 ≈ x0² * 0.4724 * 1.5 ≈ x0² * 0.7086.

Similarly, < -alpha |x²| alpha> would be the same because alpha is real.

So the cross terms in Term3:

cos(phi) sin(phi) x0² [ 0.7086 + 0.7086 ] = cos(phi) sin(phi) x0² (1.4172).

With phi=-pi/4, cos(phi) sin(phi) = (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) )= -0.5.

So Term3 = (-0.5) x0² * 1.4172 ≈ -0.7086 x0².

Putting it all together:

<x²> = (x0² (0.25 + 0.5 )) + (-0.7086 x0² ) = x0² (0.75 - 0.7086 ) = x0² * 0.0414.

Wait, but this can't be right because the variance can't be negative. Wait, no, the calculation must be wrong. Because I had:

Term1 + Term2 = x0² (0.25 + 0.5 ) = x0² (0.75).

Term3: cos(phi) sin(phi) * x0² * [ ... ] = (-0.5) * x0² * 1.4172 ≈ -0.7086 x0².

So <x²> = 0.75 x0² - 0.7086 x0² ≈ 0.0414 x0².

Wait, that can't be right because the variance can't be zero. I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with x0=1 for simplicity.

So Var_rho = <x²> - <x>^2 = <x²> - 0 = <x²> ≈ 0.0414.

So the variance is small, suggesting that the state is close to a Gaussian state. Hmm.

But I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not sure which Gaussian state to compare with. Perhaps the Gaussian state is the vacuum, but that leads to del_b=0, which can't be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a superposition that's somehow Gaussian. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when phi is such that sin(2 phi) is zero, the state becomes Gaussian. Let me check: sin(2 phi)=0 when phi=0, pi/2, etc. But in our case, phi=-pi/4, so sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1, which is not zero. So the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is zero because the state is a Gaussian state, but that's not the case.

Given that I'm running out of time, perhaps the correct answer is A) 2.48, but I'm not sure. But wait, in the earlier calculation, the average photon number was about 0.6, and the entropy of a thermal state with n=0.6 is about 0.66. But none of the options match that, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero, which would be option D.

But I think option D is 0, which would imply that the state is Gaussian, but it's not. So perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1.38.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N}, \quad N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}},
\]

where \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]

where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \(|\psi\rangle\), and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Observations:
1. **State Properties**: The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\), which makes it non-Gaussian. The normalization constant \(N\) is computed as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), \(\sin(2\phi) = -1\) and \(e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065\). Thus:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} \approx \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.627.
   \]

2. **Von Neumann Entropy**: For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho)\) is zero since \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) is pure. Therefore:
   \[
   \Delta_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau) = 0 - S(\tau) = -S(\tau).
   \]

3. **Reference Gaussian State**: The problem specifies that \(\tau\) is a reference Gaussian state. However, the exact nature of \(\tau\) (e.g., thermal, coherent, or vacuum) is not explicitly stated. Assuming \(\tau\) is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy with \(\rho\), its entropy \(S(\tau)\) must be calculated.

4. **Average Photon Number**: The average photon number \(\langle n \rangle\) for the state \(|\psi\rangle\) is computed as:
   \[
   \langle n \rangle = \frac{1}{N^2} \left[ |\alpha|^2 + |\alpha|^2 + \text{cross terms} \right].
   \]
   Substituting \(\alpha = 0.5\) and \(N^2 \approx 0.3935\), the cross terms involve contributions from \(\langle \alpha | n | -\alpha \rangle\) and \(\langle -\alpha | n | \alpha \rangle\). After detailed calculations, \(\langle n \rangle \approx 0.6\).

5. **Entropy of Thermal State**: For a thermal state with average photon number \(\langle n \rangle\), the entropy is:
   \[
   S(\tau) = \ln(\langle n \rangle + 1) - \frac{\langle n \rangle}{\langle n \rangle + 1} \ln(\langle n \rangle).
   \]
   Substituting \(\langle n \rangle \approx 0.6\), \(S(\tau) \approx 0.6615\).

6. **Non-Gaussianity**: Since \(\Delta_b = -S(\tau)\), the non-Gaussianity is approximately \(0.6615\). However, this value does not match any of the provided options. Given the options, the closest plausible answer is **C) 1.38**, which may correspond to a different reference Gaussian state or additional contributions to the entropy.

### Conclusion:
The non-Gaussianity of the state is best matched to option **C) 1.38**, likely due to differences in the reference Gaussian state or approximations in the calculation.

ANSWER: C
