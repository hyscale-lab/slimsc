Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

Alright, so there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff (effective temperature) of 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods, which I think means we can get their masses and orbital periods from that.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably means they reflect the same fraction of light. And they're both in circular orbits.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, right? That depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Oh wait, no, I think the formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (L_star/(sigma * 4 pi a²)) )^(1/4) ? Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Oh wait, no, the correct formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the balance between the incoming and outgoing radiation. The formula is T_p = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^(1/2) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

I think the standard formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). No, wait, that can't be right because the star's luminosity affects it. Oh wait, no, because T_star is based on the star's luminosity.

Wait, the star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. So the flux at the planet's orbit is L/(4 pi a²) = sigma T_p^4/(1 - albedo). So solving for T_p:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, maybe that's correct. Let me rederive it.

Flux from star at planet's distance: F = L/(4 pi a²) = (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4)/(4 pi a²) ) = (sigma T_star^4 R_star^2) / a².

Planet's equilibrium condition: F*(1 - albedo) = sigma T_p^4.

So, substituting F: (sigma T_star^4 R_star^2 / a² ) (1 - albedo) ) = sigma T_p^4.

Divide both sides by sigma: T_star^4 R_star^2 (1 - albedo) / a² = T_p^4.

Take fourth root: T
