Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. The question provides some specific details about their Lorentz factors and the directions of the photons after annihilation. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the setup. An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a gamma of 2. So, the electron is going to the right, and the positron is going to the left, but they collide somewhere. After the collision, both annihilate, producing two photons. 

The problem states that both photons have the same energy and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So, both are moving to the right but at different angles. The question is asking for the angle between these two photons.

Wait, I think I should remember some conservation laws here. Since the particles annihilate, energy and momentum must be conserved. The total momentum before collision should equal the total momentum after. Same goes for energy.

Let me think about the initial momenta. The electron has a certain momentum, and the positron has a different one. Since they're moving towards each other along the same line, their momenta will be opposite in direction. But wait, because they have different gamma factors, their momenta won't cancel each other out.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = total energy / (rest mass energy). For an electron and positron, their rest mass is the same, so the momentum is gamma multiplied by their rest mass multiplied by velocity. But since they're moving along the same line, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, I should calculate the initial momenta. Let's denote the rest mass energy as m0c². For the electron, gamma is 4, so its momentum is gamma * m0 * v_e. Similarly, the positron has gamma 2, so its momentum is gamma * m0 * v_p.

But I think it's easier to work in units where c=1. So, in that case, the momentum (p) of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m0 * v. Alternatively, since E² = (pc)² + (m0 c²
