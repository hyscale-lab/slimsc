Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves two reactions, and I need to choose the right reagents (A and B) from the options given. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, and the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and H2O with reagent B to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, so I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile. It's often used in nucleophilic substitution or addition reactions. Butan-2-one is a ketone, which usually undergoes nucleophilic addition. So the first reaction must be an addition reaction where the cyanide ion acts as the nucleophile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when NaCN is added, the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, I think that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it forms a cyanohydrin. Because the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, then gets protonated, and then the oxygen becomes an -OH group. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. That makes sense with the first product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Structure-wise, it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN, I think.

So in the first step, butan-2-one plus NaCN gives the cyanohydrin. But in the reaction, what's reagent A? The question says butan-2-one + NaCN + A -> product. Oh, right, I think that the cyanide reaction typically requires some acid catalysis. Because the mechanism for cyanohydrin formation involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. So A is probably a strong acid like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or maybe something else. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options for A: options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, H3O+ is
