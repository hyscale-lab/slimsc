Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, the options are all in meters, so the resolution is probably the length they can measure, which relates to how far the decay products travel before being detected. Right, so in particle physics, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

So, I remember that the mean path length (L) a particle travels before decaying is given by L = v * gamma * tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is gamma = E/mc². Oh wait, E is the energy, m is the rest mass. So gamma should be E divided by m.

Wait, but I need to be careful with units. The energy is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.91. So gamma is about 7.91.

But wait, is that correct? Because in particle physics, energy is often the total energy, which includes rest mass. So yes, gamma is E/(m c²), but since E is given in GeV and m is also in GeV/c², the c² cancels out? So yes, gamma is E/m.

So gamma is about 7.91. Now, the velocity v can be found using beta = v/c. Since beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)), but wait, for gamma much larger than 1, beta is approximately 1. Because for large gamma, (1/gamma^2) is negligible. So beta ≈ 1, so v ≈ c.

So putting it all together, L = v * gamma * tau_0. But since v is approximately c, which is about 3e8 meters per second.

So L = c * gamma * tau_0. Let's plug in the numbers.

c is 3e8 m/s. Gamma is 7.91. Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that.

First compute 3e8 * 8e-16. 3e8 is 3*10^8, 8e-16 is 8*10^-16. Multiplying gives 24*10^(-8) or 2.4e-7.

Then multiply by 7.91: 2.4e-7 * 7.91 ≈ 1.9e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, if the mean path length is L, then 30% of the decays would correspond to 0.3L? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The proper lifetime is tau_0, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the particles will travel a longer distance. If the resolution is the minimum detectable distance, then to see at least 30% of the decays, the fraction that have decayed within that distance should be 30%.

Wait, no. Wait, the decay probability is given by the exponential decay law: N(t) = N0 e^(-t/tau), but in the lab frame, t is gamma tau_0 times the proper time. Hmm, so maybe the fraction of particles that decay within a time t is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

But wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0. So the mean lifetime is gamma tau_0. The mean path length is L = c * gamma tau_0.

But the resolution is the minimum distance that can be measured, so to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need that the distance resolved is such that 30% of the particles decay within that distance.

Wait, perhaps it's about the velocity and the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying, which is L. But to see a decay, the particle must decay within the detector's volume. So the minimum resolution would be the distance such that the probability of decaying within that distance is 30%.

Alternatively, the problem could be about the minimum distance that the decay products must travel so that they can be observed. But perhaps the question is simply asking for the minimum resolution (i.e., the smallest length that can be detected) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0. The average path length is L = c * gamma tau_0.

But wait, 30% of the decays would be when the particles have a 30% chance to decay within a certain length. Or maybe the problem is that, given that the Bubble Chamber has a certain minimum resolution, we need to ensure that at least 30% of the decays are detected. So perhaps the length that the particle travels is L = beta gamma c tau_0, but in this case, beta is about 1, so L ≈ gamma c tau_0.

Wait, but perhaps the question is more straightforward. Maybe the minimum resolution refers to the minimum distance the decay products have to move so that they can be detected. So the minimum distance is such that the decay occurs within the detection volume. Or perhaps it's the minimum distance needed so that the detector can distinguish the decay point with sufficient precision.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate the problem. The proper lifetime is tau_0. The particle is moving at a speed v, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau_0. The distance it travels before decaying is v * gamma tau_0. So L = v gamma tau_0.

But since the particle is moving at a high speed (E=27 GeV, mass 3.41 GeV, so gamma is ~7.9, so v is close to c), we can approximate v as c. So L ≈ c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps I'm looking for the distance such that the probability of decaying within that distance is 30%.

The probability that a particle decays within a distance x is P = 1 - e^(-x/(L)), where L is the mean decay length. So, to have P = 0.3, we can set up the equation:

0.3 = 1 -
