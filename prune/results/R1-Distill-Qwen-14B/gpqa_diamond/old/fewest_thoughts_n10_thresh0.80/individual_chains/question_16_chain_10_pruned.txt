Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through each compound one by one.

First, I remember that optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light. This happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a carbon with four different substituents. Alternatively, meso compounds can be achiral even if they have stereogenic centers because of a plane of symmetry.

Let me go through each compound.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Wait, the structure here is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl, CH2CH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, but the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3? So the double bond is C1-C2, so the substituents on C1 are Cl, a double bond (which is a substituent group), and two CH2 groups? Or wait, but for a double bond, the substituents are maybe on the same side. Wait, but does this molecule have a stereocenter?

Wait, let's draw it. Structure is CH2Cl-C=C-CH2CH3? No, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with double bond between 1 and 2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl group on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the structure could be Cl attached to C1, and the double bond between C1 and C2, while C2 has a methyl group. So it's Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3) on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, but that's but-1-ene, so the molecule is
