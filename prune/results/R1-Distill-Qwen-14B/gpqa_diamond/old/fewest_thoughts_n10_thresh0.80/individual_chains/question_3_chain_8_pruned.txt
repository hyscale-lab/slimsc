Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. The formula for expectation value ⟨O⟩ is the conjugate of the state times O times the state, right?

So, the operator here is 10σz +5σx. To find the expectation value, I can split it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes sense because expectation values are linear, so I can compute each part separately and add them.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of σz, it should be straightforward. The eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the basis vectors, and σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for them, respectively.

The state ψ is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector to make it easier. Since |↑⟩ is usually (1; 0) and |↓⟩ is (0; 1), ψ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the inner product of ψ with σz acting on ψ. But since σz is diagonal in this basis, it's just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Wait, another way: Because the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of σz, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities times the corresponding eigenvalues.

So, the coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5. The probability is (0.5)^2 =0.25, and the eigenvalue for σz here is +1. For |↓⟩, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75, and the eigenvalue is -1.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Okay, that's straightforward.

Now, the second part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix. It's not diagonal in the σz basis, so I can't directly get the expectation value from the coefficients. I'll need to compute it using the state.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by the expectation of the operator. For an arbitrary state |ψ⟩, it's ψ† σx ψ. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, for a two-level system, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ can be found using the formula: ⟨σx⟩ = (|a|^2 - |b|^2), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively, but wait, is that correct? Wait, no, I think that's for another expectation value. Let me double-check.

Wait, σx is the matrix [ [0,1], [1,0] ]. So when acting on |↑⟩, it gives |↓⟩, and vice versa.

So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me
