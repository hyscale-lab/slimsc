Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about qPCR, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is that a scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran it on serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency was 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² was 1, which is a perfect correlation, so the data fits the curve well. The slope was -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope in qPCR is related to efficiency. The formula is slope = log(e) / ln(e), but wait, wait, maybe I should think again. Oh right, the slope is calculated using the formula for the standard curve method. The standard formula is slope = - (1 / efficiency) * ln(10), or something like that? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, actually, the slope when efficiency is 100% (which is 2, because each cycle doubles the DNA) would be -3.3219, approximately. Oh wait, right! Because for 100% efficiency, the slope is about -3.32. So -3.3 is very close to that, which fits with the 100% efficiency given. So that's correct.

Now looking at his results. Let me list the data he got:

- 100000 copies/µl: Ct's are 33.9,34.2,34.5. The average would be around 34.2.
- 10000: Ct's 30.6,30.9,31.2. Average 30.9.
- 1000: 27.3,27.6,27.9 → average 27.6.
- 100: 24,24.3,24.6 → average 24.3.
- 10: 20.7,21,21.3 → average 21.0.

Wait, so each time he's dil
