Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles moving in a detector. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is asking: what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's walls instead of one-third?

Wait, so when the Lorentz factor increases, the particles are moving faster, right? But how does that affect the fraction reaching the walls?

I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So a higher gamma means the particle is moving closer to the speed of light.

But the problem is about how much of the particles reach the detector walls. So the key here must be how much time the particles have to decay before they reach the walls. If they decay before traveling the radius of the detector, then they won't reach the walls. So the fraction that reaches depends on their lifetime.

Wait, the particles are fast-decaying, so their proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in their rest frame) is very short. But from the lab frame (the detector's frame), their lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

Ah, so the lab frame sees the particles living longer, allowing them to travel further. So the maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying is gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, to reach the detector walls, the particle's lifetime must be longer than the time it takes to travel the radius of the detector. So the time to reach the wall is t = R / v, where R is 30 meters and v is the particle's velocity.

So for a particle to reach the wall, its lab frame lifetime must be greater than this time. So t < gamma * tau.

Hmm, but the question is about the fraction that reach the walls. So when gamma is higher, the particles live longer, so more of them
