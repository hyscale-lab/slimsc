Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, quantum mechanics in two dimensions. I remember that when dealing with potentials, sometimes you can separate the variables and find the energy levels by solving each part. Maybe this potential separates into r and θ parts, so I can treat each direction separately.

Let me look at the potential function. The first term is (1/2)kr². Oh, wait, that looks familiar. That's the potential for a harmonic oscillator in radial direction. Because the standard 1D harmonic oscillator has potential V(r) = ½ m ω² r², but in terms of k, maybe k is m ω²? Or maybe it's already expressed in terms of k.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, that can be expressed in terms of angular variables. Cos squared theta often comes up in angular parts of potentials, like in polar coordinates. Maybe this term can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Let me think: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ] = (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

So now, the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Let me combine the terms without the cosine. ½ kr² + ¾ kr² is equal to ( (2/4) + (3/4) ) kr² = (5/4) kr². So now V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe the potential can be written in terms of r and θ in a way that allows separation into radial and angular parts. Alternatively, perhaps using polar coordinates isn't the best approach. Alternatively, maybe it's better to switch to Cartesian coordinates, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The potential may be separable into a function of r and a function of θ. Let me see. The first term is (1/2)kr², which is just a function of r. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ, which is also a function of θ multiplied by r². So perhaps I can write V(r,θ) as [ (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ ] = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Wait, but in terms of separation, that doesn't directly help. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of functions each depending on either r or θ. Alternatively, maybe it's a product of functions, but I don't think
