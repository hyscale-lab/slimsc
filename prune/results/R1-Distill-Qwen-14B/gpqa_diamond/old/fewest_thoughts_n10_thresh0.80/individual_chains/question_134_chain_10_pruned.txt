Okay, I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, this problem has three solutions, two acids and one base, right? Oh wait, actually, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a diprotic strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, they should neutralize each other.

Wait, but wait. How do multiple acids and bases work here? So, I think the first thing to do is figure out how much acid and base are present, and then see which is in excess.

So, the acids are HCl and H2SO4. The base is Ba(OH)2. Both HCl and H2SO4 can donate H+ ions, while Ba(OH)2 can provide OH- ions.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each acid and the base.

First, HCl. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

Next, H2SO4. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 moles of H+. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L, molarity 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, wait, but the reaction is acid + base â†’ salt + water. The neutralization will proceed until either the acid or base is exhausted. So I need to see which is in excess.

Total H+ available: 0.28 moles. Total OH- available: 0.2 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reagent here. Because 0.28 > 0.2, so OH- will be completely neutralized, and some H+ will remain.

So the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+ with 0.2 moles of OH-. That forms 0.2 moles of water.

Wait, but wait. How does the H+ come from the acids? Because HCl is a strong acid, it
