Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can figure out.

So, the question involves some organic reactions, and I need to track the structure changes through each step to find the correct NMR coupling pattern for product 3. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage-like molecule. The 1,3-dibromo suggests there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with such a base, elimination reactions can occur. So probably an E2 mechanism, leading to the formation of an alkene. Wait, but how many eliminations? Since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, the bromide leaves, and a double bond forms.

Wait, but in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are usually not very good at forming double bonds due to Bredt's rule. Bredt's rule says that bridgehead positions (like in norbornene) don't typically form alkenes because of the strain. Oh, but wait, adamantane's structure—maybe the elimination leads to a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH causes a ring-opening or some kind of dehydrohalogenation but not forming a typical double bond. Hmm.

Wait, maybe in this case, the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But with KOH, substitution would give a diol, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, but if it's elimination, maybe the product is a diene or some kind of strained alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a conjugated diene. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules upon dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene. But would that be possible in adamantane?

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a more stable product, like removing two Brs and forming an alkene bridge.

Wait, but the NMR data of product 1 can help. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). There's also a strong IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, 1720 is probably a ketone or an ester. But if product 1 comes from a substitution reaction, perhaps it's a diol, but that wouldn't have a carbonyl. So elimination might form a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, it undergoes two eliminations, possibly forming an exo-diol with some carbonyl groups. Or perhaps it's a peroxide formation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 could be a ketone.
