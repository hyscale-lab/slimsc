Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when compounds react with a mixture of hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite (NaNO2), and water, it's often related to diazotization or maybe some kind of condensation reaction. Wait, but wait, another thought: I think this treatment is typical for the formation of carbonyl groups, perhaps through elimination or some keto-enol tautomerism. Oh, right! I think this is the Beckmann rearrangement or maybe the Stephen reduction, but wait, no, that's for amides. Maybe it's the formation of a carbonyl from an alcohol.

Wait, another possibility: The treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and water could be part of the HNO2-mediated oxidation or something like that. Alternatively, I remember that primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes using certain conditions, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, could it be a Hofmann elimination? No, Hofmann usually involves amines. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: I've heard that when amines, especially aromatic ones, undergo diazotization with nitrous acid (HNO2), they form diazonium salts, which can then decompose. But in this case, the products are diketones, which suggests two carbonyl groups. So maybe the starting materials are something that can form two carbonyl groups upon treatment.

Wait a second, I think when a cyclic ketone is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it can undergo ring contraction or expansion. Oh wait, I remember that when a cyclic ketone (like cyclohexanone) is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) under acidic conditions, it can undergo the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which introduces an oxygen adjacent to the ketone, but I'm not sure if that's leading to a diketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the compounds A and B are alcohols that are oxidized to ketones. But wait, oxidation of secondary alcohols produces ketones, and primary alcohols give aldehydes or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. But the products here are diketones, meaning each product has two ketone groups.

So, if A and B are diols (two hydroxyl groups), then perhaps upon treatment, they get oxidized to diketones. Wait, but oxidation of diols would require each OH to be oxidized. Alternatively, maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another thought: I think that when a secondary alcohol is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it can form a nitro compound or undergo elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the products given. The first product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione, which has two ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring at positions 1 and 2, and an isopropyl group at position 4. The second product
