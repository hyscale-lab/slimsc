Okay, so I have this question here about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question says my colleague has a Feynman diagram with a "size estimate" next to it. The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And I need to find out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process, which in turn affects the dependence on coupling constants and other factors. Each loop typically contributes a factor involving integrals which often lead to terms like (4π)^{-something} because of the loop momentum integrals.

Let me break down the given expression. Let's see:

- alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4πε₀ħc) ≈ 1/137. So alpha is a dimensionless coupling constant.
- g is another coupling constant, maybe from some gauge symmetry, like the strong force.
- sqrt(2) is just a numerical factor, probably from some symmetry or combinatorial count.
- 8 is another numerical factor.
- 1/(4pi)^6: that's (4π)^{-6}. So the denominator has a (4pi) to the sixth power.
- (Q/M)^2 is a ratio of energies squared, perhaps a mass scale or a momentum scale.

Now, I recall that each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (4π)^{-d}, where d is the number of dimensions. But wait, the theory is in four-dimensional spacetime, so each loop would contribute a (4π)^{-2} factor because in four dimensions, the loop integral typically gives a 1/(epsilon) pole in dimensional regularization, but in terms of actual factors when you evaluate the integral, you often get terms like (4π)^{d/2 - n}, where d is the dimension. Alternatively, I might be mixing some things up here.

Wait, more accurately, when you calculate loop integrals in four dimensions, the loop integral typically involves integrating over d^4k, which in dimensional regularization becomes d^d k where d is near 4. But when you evaluate the integrals in four dimensions, they can lead to terms involving (4π)^{some exponent}.

Each loop usually comes with a factor that includes (4π)^{-2} because the loop integral in four dimensions for a scalar loop, for example, gives a result proportional to (4π)^{2 - (d/2)} when using dimensional regularization, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, but in terms of Feynman diagrams and perturbation theory, each loop contributes a factor of (4π)^{-2} from the loop integral. So for a diagram with L loops, the denominator would have a (4π)^{2L} term. So for example, a one-loop diagram would have 1/(4π)^2, two-loop would have 1/(4π)^4, and so on.

Looking at the given expression, the denominator is (4π)^6. So that
