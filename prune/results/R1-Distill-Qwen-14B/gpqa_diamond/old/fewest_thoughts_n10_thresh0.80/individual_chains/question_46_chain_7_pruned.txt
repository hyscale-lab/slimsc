Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis typically involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, wait, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? No, wait. Let me get that right. Pent has five carbons. 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the methyl is on C3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. But wait, I might have messed up. Let me draw it:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5
Structure: CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, pent is five carbons, so 1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But that's 1-pentene. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. But wait, in that case, the third carbon is the one with the methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? That makes sense.

Now, when Grubbs catalyst is used, it's a ring-closing metathesis or ring
