Okay, so I have this density matrix problem here. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The options are A to D with different r coordinates.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a second, I remember that density matrices have to be positive semi-definite and trace one. Let me check the trace first. The trace is the sum of the diagonals. Each |0⟩⟨0| contributes 1 on the top left, and |1⟩⟨1| contributes 1 on the bottom right. So adding them together gives 2, but then multiplied by 1/2, so the trace is 1. That's good.

Now, I need to find the geometrical position. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Because for a single qubit state, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. So I should convert this ρ into the Bloch vector form.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x,y,z). So I can rewrite the given ρ in this form and find the components of r.

Let me write out the given ρ:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) 

Expanding this, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Now, comparing this with the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, I can set them equal:

(I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 

Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives 0 = r·σ. So r must be zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The Pauli matrices σ are [σ_x, σ_y, σ_z]. So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. Adding I to this and dividing by 2 gives ρ.

In our case, ρ is the identity matrix (since I/2 is a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. Wait, no, wait: |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], so adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is I. So ρ is (I)/2.

So, (I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives 0 = (r·σ)/2. So r·σ must be zero. That implies r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0 matrix.

But the Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So if r·σ is zero matrix, then each component must be zero. Let's write out r·σ.

r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[0,0],[0,0]]

Breaking this into components:

Top left: r_z * 1 = 0 → r_z = 0.

Top right: r_x - i r_y = 0 → r_x = i r_y.

Bottom left: r_x + i r_y = 0 → same as top right, which gives r_x = -i r_y. Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recompute:

The sum is:

[ [r_z, r_x - i r_y],
  [r_x + i r_y, -r_z ] ]

This must equal zero matrix. So all elements must be zero.

So,

r_z = 0,

r_x - i r_y = 0,

r_x + i r_y = 0,

and -r_z = 0 → which again gives r_z = 0.

From the second equation: r_x = i r_y.

From the third equation: r_x = -i r_y.

So combining r_x = i r_y and r_x = -i r_y implies that i r_y = -i r_y → 2i r_y = 0 → r_y = 0.

Then, r_x = i * 0 = 0. So r_x = 0, r_y=0, r_z=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That corresponds to the completely mixed state. Because the density matrix is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Wait, but wait a second. The maximally mixed state is (I/2), which is represented by the origin on the Bloch sphere. Because any pure state is on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state has no coherence and is at the center.

So in the Bloch sphere, the point is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

The Bloch sphere representation of a single-qubit density matrix is given by 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), we see that 

\[
\frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not the mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a different mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0):** Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this is not a valid state on the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the density matrix is represented by the Bloch vector \((0,0,0)\). 

Answer: C
