Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. I remember that the gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because in four dimensions, each gamma matrix is a 4x4 matrix, but their mass dimension is zero. 

So, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because in four spacetime dimensions, the action is the integral of the Lagrangian density, which is dimensionless in natural units (where ħ and c are 1). So the Lagrangian density must have dimension [Mass]^4.

Let me break down each part of the term. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. 

First, ψ is a spinor field. Spinor fields have mass dimension 3/2 in four dimensions. Because the Dirac Lagrangian is L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, and the derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So, the ψ must have dimension 3/2 each. So ψ̄ also has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

What about σ_{μν}? Since it's made from the commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, σ_{μν} has the same dimension as the product of the derivatives, but wait, no, actually, wait. Wait, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu], which is antisymmetric in mu and nu. But each gamma is dimensionless, so σ_{mu nu} is also dimensionless. Because it's a product of gammas without any derivatives, right? So [σ_{μν}] = [γ_mu][gamma_nu]/(i/2) → dimensionless.

So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) + 0 = 3. But wait, no, that's not because σ is sandwiched between ψ̄ and ψ, but σ itself's dimension. Let me think again: ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, σ is dimensionless, ψ also 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3 (since sigma is dim 0).

Then, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so each derivative has dimension 1, and A is a gauge field with dimension 1. So F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So the dimensions are [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3 + 2.

The entire Lagrangian must have dimension 4 (since it's the integrand, and the action is dimensionless). So 4 = [κ] + 5 → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Wait, no, [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3, and [F] is 2. So 3 + 2 =5. So [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now the second part: Is the theory renormalizable? For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension (or zero?), but wait. Wait, no. The general rule is that a coupling with dimension [g] ≥ 0. Because in 4 dimensions, the interaction terms in the Lagrangian have to have dimension ≤4. Wait, no. Wait, the term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term's dimension is 4.

But for renormalizability, the coupling constants can't have negative mass dimension because that would mean that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (non-renormalizable). So the dimension of the coupling must be ≥0 for the interaction to be renormalizable.

Wait, the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling
