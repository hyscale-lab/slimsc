Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So substituting in, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So, the calculation would be (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That's (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So degree of unsaturation is 5. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds or 3 degrees) plus maybe an ester or amide group, which would account for the other two.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad, probably N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has an N, maybe it's an amide or something with an amine. Wait, the IR also has a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740, amides lower, maybe 1650-1700? So this could be an ester or maybe a ketone, but the formula doesn't seem to fit a ketone. Or wait, maybe a carboxylic acid? But the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3300 in that case, but the given IR has two bands around 3400, which are probably N-H from an amide or maybe an amine.

Wait, another thought: if it's an amide, the NH stretch would be around 3300-3500, which matches the IR. But amide carbonyls are usually a bit lower, like around 1680. Hmm, but the IR here is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Could it be an ester? So maybe the compound is an ester with an amine group or something else.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably a methyl group attached to something like an ethyl group. So maybe a CH2CH3 group, where the CH3 is next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet with 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with water or something else, or possibly a methylene next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3, but that's usually a quartet. Wait, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. Alternatively, maybe adjacent to an amine group?

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests splitting into four, which is common for a CH2 next to another CH2. For example, in an ethyl ester, the CH2 adjacent to oxygen is usually around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Wait, so maybe an ester group, like OCH2CH3. Because in that case, the -OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 near 4.1, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe a different situation.

Then, 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Doublets each with 2H. That seems like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So two doublets in the aromatic region, which could indicate a para-disubstituted benzene, like with two substituents opposite each other. Because in para substitution, each proton is adjacent to two of the same, leading to a doublet.

Putting this together: A benzene ring with substituents at para positions. One substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, because of the IR carbonyl. Another substituent could be an amino group or an ester group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. But the NMR aromatic protons would be more complex if substituents are at meta positions. Wait, since the aromatic is two doublets, that suggests para substitution. So if the substituents are at para, 1 and 4 positions, then the aromatic Hs would be in two doublets. So if it's 3-ethoxy, that's meta, which would give a different splitting, perhaps more than two peaks or more complex. So maybe option A is not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is a formamide (HCONH-) attached to a benzene where the ethoxy is at para position. The benzamide would have the substituents at para. So the aromatic Hs would be two doublets, which matches. The formamide group would have NH2, but the IR shows a strong band at 3420 and 3325. Formamide has NH, but the NMR would show some signals. Wait, the NMR doesn't show any peaks around 8-9 ppm for the amide NH. But in the NMR given, the protons are up to 8.0 ppm. The aromatic is at 7 and 8 ppm. But formamide's NH is usually around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. So why isn't there a peak in that region? Maybe because in the NMR data given, the amide NH is missing. Maybe it's an ester instead.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionyl group attached to the benzene with an amino group. But propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. The structure would be something like PhNH2 and PhCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, C9H11NO2. Let me think about the structure. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2 attached to a propionate
