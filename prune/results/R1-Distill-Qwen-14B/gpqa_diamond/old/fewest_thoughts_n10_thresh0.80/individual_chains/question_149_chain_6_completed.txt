Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question about a peptidic compound. Hmm, let's go through it step by step.

So, the question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Wait, same alpha-proton. So, same environment, but two peaks. The shifts are similar, integrals add up to 1H. So, they're probably not splitting each other because the coupling is ruled out. So, why would there be two peaks from the same proton?

Wait, maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, the question mentions it's a small peptidic compound. So, perhaps during synthesis, some diastereomers or enantiomers are present. Or maybe there's some other issue like double coupling.

Looking at the NMR part, the peaks for the alpha-proton are the same, so maybe they are in a different environment but similar. But if the integral adds up to 1H, maybe they are two different environments but same in some way. Wait, but if it's the same proton, why two peaks? Could it be that the molecule is in two different conformers? Or maybe something else.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with same mass. So, same molecular weight, same retention time? Wait, no, same mass but different peaks. So, same mass, meaning same molecular weight. So, maybe it's two isomers.

If the mass is the same, they can't be different isotopes because LC-MS would separate them if they were, but the question says same mass. So, same mass but different structures.

Wait, the question says the peaks have same mass. So, same molecular weight. So, maybe they are enantiomers. Because enantiomers have the same molecular weight but are different in structure. But wait, LC-MS might separate enantiomers if the column is chiral. But if the LC is a regular column, the enantiomers would elute at the same time. Oh wait, but the question says that the LC-MS shows two peaks. Which would mean that the LC is separating them. So, that suggests the presence of diastereomers, not enantiomers, because diastereomers have different physical properties and would elute at different times on a regular LC column.

But wait, if the two peaks have same mass, same retention time, no, wait no. The question says two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity. Same mass, which implies same molecular weight. So, perhaps it's a diastereomer, but wait, diastereomers have different molecular weights? No, same molecular formula, same molecular weight. Oh yes, because diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. So same molecular weight, but different physical properties, so would elute at different times on the same column.

But in the NMR, why are there two peaks for the same alpha hydrogen? Let's think. If it's a diastereomer, then the same proton in different diastereomers would have slightly different chemical shifts. But in the NMR, the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton in each isomer. Wait, but if they are diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons. So, maybe in the crude mixture, the diastereomers are present in equal amounts. So, each diastereomer would contribute their own peak for the alpha proton. So, in the NMR, you'd see two peaks, each corresponding to the same position in each diastereomer, but with different shifts, but similar because the environment isn't too different.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says "same alpha-proton" or "same proton in the structure"? Let me read again. "Two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton." So, same proton in the same environment, but two peaks. That's confusing. Because if the same proton is there, why two peaks? Unless there's some kind of splitting or coupling, but the coupling is ruled out.

Wait, maybe the splitting is due to something else. Maybe the presence of two diastereomers. So, each diastereomer has the same alpha proton, but in different environments, so they appear as separate peaks. But in the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute a peak for that proton. So, if the mixture is 50:50, each would give a peak, and together they'd add up to 2H? But the question says the integrals add up to 1H. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, the integrals are roughly equal and together 1H. So each is 0.5H? That can't be right. Maybe the NMR is showing two different environments for the same proton, leading to two peaks, but each with 0.5H, adding to 1H.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe the molecule is in different conformations, but NMR usually averages over conformations unless the time scale is slow. But if the conformers are interconverting on the NMR timescale, you wouldn't see separate peaks. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a problem with the synthesis. The question mentions that the peaks in the NMR are same alpha-proton. So, perhaps the compound is a diastereomer mixture. Let's think about diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different shifts for the same proton.

But wait, if the molecule has two stereocenters, and the crude product is a mix of two diastereomers, each would have the same alpha proton in different environments, so each would have a separate peak. So, if the mixture is 50:50, each would contribute a peak, but with similar shifts if the environments are similar.

Alternatively, maybe it's a racemic mixture. Enantiomers. In that case, the NMR would show the same peaks because enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. So you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. So that can't be the case. So option B is probably not correct.

Another possibility is that during the synthesis, a double bond was formed with some E/Z isomerism. But the question is about alpha protons, which are adjacent to the amide or carbonyl group. Maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another thought. The question says that the two peaks have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So each integral is about 0.5H. That might suggest that each peak is due to a different environment for the same proton, such as in diastereomers. So, if the molecule has two diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton but in slightly different environments, their NMRs would show two peaks for that proton, each integrating to 0.5H, adding to 1H. But why would the same proton in diastereomers have similar shifts? Because the substituents around it are similar, just arranged differently.

So, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, each 0.5H, and same mass in LC-MS. So the compound is a mixture of diastereomers. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but what about the coupling? The question says that the peaks are not due to spin-spin coupling. So, coupling can't explain it. So perhaps the two peaks are from two diastereomers each contributing one peak for the same proton.

So, looking at the options:

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. That would fit because each diastereomer would contribute a peak for the alpha proton, leading to two peaks in the NMR, same integral, same shift roughly.

But wait, what about option C, 'double coupling' during amide bond formation? What's that? I'm not too sure. Maybe it's when two different coupling partners cause splitting. But the question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So, the two peaks aren't due to coupling between two protons. So, double coupling seems unlikely.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If there's a precursor, it would have a different molecular weight. So the LC-MS would show a peak with a different mass. But the question says both peaks have same mass, so that's not the case. So A is unlikely.

So, considering all, the most likely answer is D, mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing the NMR and LC-MS data of a chemically synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and the coupling pattern ruling out spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **NMR Observations**:
   - The two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggest two distinct environments for the proton, likely due to stereoisomerism. Since the integrals add up to 1H, each peak corresponds to 0.5H, indicating a 50:50 mixture of two stereoisomers.
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the peaks are not due to splitting between neighboring protons.

2. **LC-MS Observations**:
   - The two peaks have the same mass, meaning the compounds are stereoisomers (enantiomers or diastereomers) with the same molecular formula and molecular weight.
   - If the LC-MS column is achiral, enantiomers would elute at the same time, but the presence of two distinct peaks suggests diastereomers, which have different physical properties and elute at different times.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **A) Contamination with a precursor**: A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a distinct peak in LC-MS. Since both peaks have the same mass, this is unlikely.
   - **B) Racemic mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra, so they would not produce separate peaks for the same proton. This does not explain the NMR observations.
   - **C) Double coupling during amide-bond formation**: The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling, making this explanation invalid.
   - **D) Mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereomers have different physical properties and would elute separately in LC-MS. In NMR, the same proton in different diastereomers would experience slightly different chemical environments, leading to two peaks with similar shifts and equal integrals. This explanation fits all observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
