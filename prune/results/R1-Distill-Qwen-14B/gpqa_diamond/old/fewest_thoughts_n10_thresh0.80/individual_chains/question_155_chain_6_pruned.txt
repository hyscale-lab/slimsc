Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and I have the state vector given. 

Wait, the problem says that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the matrix representations for P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in the P_z basis. That makes sense because when operators are expressed in their eigenbasis, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues, and the off-diagonal elements are the matrix elements between different states.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So, for P_z, I'll need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then plug them into this formula.

Wait, but since the state is already expressed in the P_z basis, calculating ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ might be straightforward. Because in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value of P_z is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Same for ⟨P_z²⟩, because if P_z is diagonal, then P_z squared is the same as the square of each eigenvalue times the basis vectors.

So, let me think. The diagonal elements of P_z are given in the matrix. Let me look again: P_z's matrix is [[ℏ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ℏ]]. So the eigenvalues are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ. The basis vectors are |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ corresponding to these eigenvalues.

The state vector is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 )^T. Wait, but this vector must be normalized, right? Let me check the sum of the squares of the components. (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (
