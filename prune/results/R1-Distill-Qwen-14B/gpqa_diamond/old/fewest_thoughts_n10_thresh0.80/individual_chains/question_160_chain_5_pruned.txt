Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture shaped like a polygon. Let me try to break it down.

The question says the aperture is an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field where intensity maxima and minima occur. The main thing is to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Hmm, I remember that in single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at certain angles determined by the slit width. The formula for the minima in single-slit is something like a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order of the minima (like m=1, 2, 3...). But wait, that's for a single slit. What about a polygon?

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the aperture becomes a circular one. Oh, right, so this problem is essentially about a circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a polygon, the apothem is given, and the distance from the center to a vertex (the radius) would be different. Oh wait, but when N is very large, the polygon is almost a circle, and the apothem 'a' would be approximately equal to the radius of the circle because each side is very small and the apothem and radius are almost the same.

Wait, no, actually, for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) by a = R * cos(π/N). When N is very large, π/N is very small, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²), but for N approaching infinity, a approaches R. So for the case of N→∞, a ≈ R, so the radius of the circular aperture is a. Or wait, perhaps the apothem is the radius of the circle. Because in a polygon, as N increases, the apothem approaches the radius of the circumscribed circle. So yes, for N→∞, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a.

So now, the problem becomes finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait again. No, no, wait. The circular aperture's diffraction pattern has a central maximum, and the first minimum is at an angle θ given by a sinθ = λ. Wait, wait, no. The formula for the minima in single-slit is a sinθ = mλ, but for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is more complicated. The minima in the far field for a circular aperture (like a pinhole) occur at angles given by a sinθ = λ, but wait, no, not exactly.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is called the Airy disk. The minima in the diffraction pattern occur at angles where the Bessel function of the first kind has its zeros. The first minimum (the smallest
