Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs a photon, and the selection rules determine which transitions are allowed. 

The question says the state |3,0,0> decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. So it's a two-step process. Each step would involve a transition between states, and each transition must follow the selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for the hydrogen atom in non-relativistic theory... The main ones are: delta l = ±1, so the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit. Also, delta m can be 0, ±1. So m can stay the same or change by one unit. And for the principal quantum number n, delta n can be ±1 (but not zero), but in multi-photon processes, maybe more steps are allowed. But here, it's two dipole transitions, so each transition must involve a change of delta n = ±1, I think.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It needs to go to n=1, l=0, m=0. Since it's two transitions, probably each transition changes n by 1. So first from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1. Because 3→2→1 is a two-step change of n by -1 each time.

Now, the first transition is from n=3, l=0 (s orbital) to a state where l can change by ±1. So from l=0 to l=1. So the first transition could be to a state with l=1. What about m? Since m can change by 0, +1, or -1. The initial m is 0, so after the first transition, m could be -1, 0, or +1.

So the first possible state after transition from 3,0,0 would be 2,1, m where m is -1,0,+1.

Wait, the options are about the specific transition paths. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. So the first transition is to l=1, m=0. Then the next transition is from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. Let me check if that's allowed. The second transition: n goes from 2 to 1 (allowed, delta n = -1). l goes from 1 to 0 (delta l = -1, allowed). m goes from 0 to 0 (delta m=0, allowed). So this path is valid.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0. Wait, the first transition would be m going from 0 to +1. Then the second transition is 2,1,1 to 1,0,0. Let's see: for the second transition, n goes from 2→1 (okay), l goes from 1→0 (delta l = -1, okay). m goes from 1→0, which is delta m = -1,
