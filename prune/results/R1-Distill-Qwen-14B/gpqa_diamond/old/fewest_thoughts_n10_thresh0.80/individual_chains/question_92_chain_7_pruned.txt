Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of formation questions can be tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation for this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks like a pretty big molecule. I think it's some sort of alkene with multiple substituents. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Maybe it's a diene or something with multiple double bonds? Let me see, I count two double bonds in the structure. Okay, so it's a molecule with two C=C bonds.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon (1000 kJ/mol), bond energies for H-H (100), C-C (200), C=C (300), and C-H (400). So the problem is asking me to use these bond energies to find the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for hydrocarbons, that would be from carbon ( graphite?) and hydrogen gas.

The formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is something like: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed)

But wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Because bond breaking is endothermic, so you have to subtract the bond energies formed. Or maybe I should think in terms of the molecule being built from atoms. Let me get this straight.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energies required to break all the bonds in the reactants and the energies released when forming all the bonds in the products. 

Alternatively, the formula is:

ΔHf° = Σ [Bond energies of reactant bonds] - Σ [Bond energies of product bonds]

Wait, no, I think I'm getting it mixed up. Because when you form a bond, energy is released. So if you're forming the molecule from its elements, you have to break the bonds in the elements and then form the bonds in the molecule.

So for example, for a molecule like CH4, the process would be:

C(graphite) + 2 H
