Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spin states and operators. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem starts by giving a state vector for an electron, |alpha>. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is usually denoted as S_z. The eigenvalues are ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>, right?

But the first thing I need to do is find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation given by A_ij, where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices have 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal, but scaled here by ħ/2. So the operator A is (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Right, the eigenstates of σ_x are not |up> and |down>; they're the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So to find the probabilities, I think I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of these new eigenstates.

First things first, I need to normalize |alpha>, right? Because the given state is proportional to that expression. Let me find the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let's compute the inner product of this with itself to find the normalization constant.

The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 -i)(2 + i), since |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So (1+i)(1-i) is (1 +1) = 2. Then (2 -i)(2 +i) is (4 + 2i -2i +1) = 5. So the total is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, the operator in question is A = (ħ/2) σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x is the Pauli x matrix, which has eigenstates that are superpositions of |up> and |down> with equal coefficients.

So, let's denote the eigenstates of A as |+x> and |−x>, where:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>. Because then the coefficients will give me the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Let me substitute |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>. From the definitions above,

|up> = (|+x> + |−x> ) / sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |−x> ) / sqrt(2)

So substituting these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>) ]

Expanding the terms inside the brackets:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|−x>

Now, combine like terms:

[ (1+i + 2 -i) |+x> ] + [ (1+i - 2 +i) |−x> ]

Simplify each coefficient:

For |+x>:

1 + i + 2 - i = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3.

For |−x>:

1 + i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) ) = -1 + 2i.

So now, |alpha> becomes:

(1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ]

Factor out the constants:

(1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))) [ 3 |+x> + ( -1 + 2i ) |−x> ]

But wait, we can compute the magnitude squared of each coefficient to find the probabilities.

The probability of measuring |+x> is |3/(sqrt(14))|². Because 3 is multiplied by |+x>, and the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(14) (since sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) is sqrt(14)).

Wait, let me correct that. The coefficient for |+x> is (3)/(sqrt(14)), and for |−x> it's (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). So the probabilities are the squared magnitudes.

So, probability P(+x) = |3|^2 / 14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857. Hmm, that's roughly 0.64.

Probability P(-x) = | (-1 + 2i) |² /14. The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4 =5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.357142, which is about 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, the option says "eigenstates of the operator", which is A. So the probabilities match option A's first two numbers: 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, the problem also asks for the average value of the operator A. Oh, right! So I need to compute the expectation value <A>.

The operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, so its expectation is (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_x.

Alternatively, the expectation value <A> is (ħ/2) times ( <up| σ_x |up> ... )? Wait, I think a better approach is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in the x-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute in that basis. Or, maybe using the original coefficients.

But let me think. The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A = (ħ/2) σ_x, which has matrix representation:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ ħ/2, 0 ]]

Wait, so in the basis of |up> and |down>. So the state |alpha> is a column vector, and we can represent it as [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

First, compute A |alpha>:

A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and (ħ/2) off-diagonal.

So,

A |alpha> = [ (ħ/2)*(2 - i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)*(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Because for the first component: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2-i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Similarly, the second component is (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7).

Now, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A | alpha>.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, the first component of A |alpha> is (ħ/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7). So the inner product would be:

(1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7)

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) * (ħ/2) / (7)
Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) * (ħ/2) / (7)

Compute the numerators:

First term numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 (since i² = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Second term numerator: (2)(1) + (2)(i) + (i)(1) + (i)(i)
= 2 + 2i + i + i²
= 2 +3i -1
= 1 +3i.

So adding both terms:

(1 -3i + 1 +3i) * (ħ/2) /7
= (2) * (ħ/2) /7
= (2 * ħ) / (14)
= ħ /7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is ħ/7. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So option A seems to match.

But wait, let me double-check the probabilities.

Wait, when I computed the probabilities, I got P(+x) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 and P(-x) =5/14 ≈ 0.357142. So approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that would be option A.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D has average 2hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, but my calculation says ħ/7. So option A is the only one that matches all parts.


The problem involves an electron in a state |α> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α>
The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize, compute the inner product:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalization constant is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), and the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle\right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, with \(A = (\hbar/2)\sigma_x\). The eigenstates of \(\sigma_x\) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express |α> in terms of |+x> and |-x>
Substitute \(|\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle)\) and \(|\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle)\) into \(|\alpha\rangle\):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[(1+i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) + (2-i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle)\right].
\]

Simplify:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle\right].
\]

The coefficients of \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) are \(3/\sqrt{14}\) and \((-1+2i)/\sqrt{14}\), respectively.

### Step 4: Compute probabilities
The probability of measuring \(|+x\rangle\) is the squared magnitude of the coefficient:

\[
P(+x) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

The probability of measuring \(|-x\rangle\) is:

\[
P(-x) = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{1^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of A
The operator \(A = (\hbar/2)\sigma_x\) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value of A is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substitute \(|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}[(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle]\) and \(A|\uparrow\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), \(A|\downarrow\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}|\uparrow\rangle\):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[(1-i)\frac{\hbar}{2}(2-i) + (2+i)\frac{\hbar}{2}(1+i)\right].
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \left[(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)\right].
\]

Compute the terms:

\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 1 + 3i.
\]

Add them:

\[
1 - 3i + 1 + 3i = 2.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \cdot 2 = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \(\hbar/\sqrt{7}\). These match the values in **Option A**.
