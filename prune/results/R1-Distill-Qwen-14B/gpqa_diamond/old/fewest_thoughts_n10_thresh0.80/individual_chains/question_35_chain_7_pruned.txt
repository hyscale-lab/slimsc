Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through this step by step. 

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The matrix form of Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I think S is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, let's write down matrix S first. So S looks like this:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay is c times S. So substituting c, we have Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix Ay would be:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0   (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i    (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

So that's the matrix Ay we're dealing with. Now, the task is to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then decide which of the given statements is correct.

Hmm, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues.

So let's set up that equation. The matrix (Ay - λI) would be:

[ (-λ)        (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))  (-λ)       ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]. Let me compute each part.

The first term is λ². The second term is [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] which simplifies. Let's compute that: (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h²/(4π)^2) * 1. So the determinant equation becomes λ² - (h²/(4π)^2) = 0.

So solving this: λ² = h²/(4π)^2. Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π). Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. Wait, because the matrix Ay is actually a Hermitian matrix? Wait, is that the case?

Wait, is S a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. The conjugate transpose of S would be:

[ 0    i ]
[ -i   0 ]

Comparing to S itself, which is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So the conjugate transpose is [0 i; -i 0], which is different from S. So S isn't Hermitian. But when multiplied by c, which is real, Ay would not be Hermitian unless S is. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, S is given as the matrix with first row 0 -i and second row i 0. So S is a 2x2 matrix. If we take the conjugate transpose (which for real matrices is just the transpose), let's see:

The transpose of S would swap the off-diagonal elements. So S transposed is:

[0 i]
[-i 0]

Which is the same as the conjugate transpose because the elements are real except for the i's, which when conjugated would become -i. Wait, but in the matrix S, the (1,2) element is -i, and (2,1) is i. So the conjugate transpose would have (1,2) as i and (2,1) as -i. Wait, that's not matching S. So S is not Hermitian. Hence, Ay is not necessarily Hermitian. But wait, I thought that angular momentum operators are Hermitian. Oh wait, wait, the operator Ay is part of the angular momentum, which should be Hermitian since it's an observable. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, the matrix S could be the Pauli matrices. Oh, wait, the Pauli sigma matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me think. The given S matrix has the form of a Pauli matrix. Let me see:

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]

σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So our S matrix is exactly σy. Because the first row is 0,
