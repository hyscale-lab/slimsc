Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincare Symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, 4. CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators in SMEFT should maintain the same symmetries as the Standard Model, plus any others that are naturally included.

Let me break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is fundamental in relativity. The Standard Model and thus SMEFT must respect this because all particles and interactions are described using Lorentz-invariant terms. So SMEFT operators should be Lorentz symmetric.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since SMEFT is built from local interactions, it should respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, but isn't Poincare a broader symmetry that includes not just Lorentz but also things like momentum conservation? So if the theory respects Lorentz and is local, it should respect Poincare. So yes, it must be respected.

3. CP Symmetry: The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric in general. For example, CP violation is seen in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP symmetry. Operators could violate CP, so this symmetry isn't necessarily required.

4. CPT Symmetry: I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Any valid QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So SMEFT, being a QFT, must have operators that respect CPT.

Wait, but does the SMEFT respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model plus more? Or are there exceptions? I think in SMEFT, you can have operators that break some of the Standard Model's symmetries, like custodial symmetry, but CPT is a more fundamental symmetry that must be preserved.

So which options are correct? Let's go through each point.

Must all operators respect Lorentz symmetry? I think yes. Because without it, the theory wouldn't make sense in a relativistic framework.

Poincare: Since Lorentz and translations are part of Poincare, and SMEFT is a relativistic theory, yes. So 1 and 2 are both required.

CP symmetry isn't required, as the Standard Model already violates it, so SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry is required because it's a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories. So 4 must be respected.

So the operators must respect 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. Option C is 'A) 1,2' no, wait the options are:

Options:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4, which is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is fundamental in relativistic theories. Since SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. As SMEFT is a local relativistic theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already violates CP symmetry (e.g., through the CKM matrix). SMEFT does not require CP symmetry to be preserved, as it can include operators that violate CP.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is a quantum field theory, all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
