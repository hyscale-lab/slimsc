Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitting something. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says we have two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, the initial state is 1S0, and after emitting X, the state becomes something else. 

Pauli statistics require that the isospin T(NN), angular momentum L(NN), and spin S(NN) of the final state satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2. Oh wait, and the problem says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So, that's an important point.

The question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. The options are different transitions, each with a lowercase letter (p, s, f), which I think denote the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. So, p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3 maybe? Wait, yeah, s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3. So each option gives the final state of the NN system and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum.

I remember that parity is conserved in strong interactions, but for weak it's not. But particle X here is emitted, so I guess we're considering the parity of the process. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1.

The problem mentions using conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So, I need to check both for each option.

First, let's outline the process. The initial state is 1S0. So, the term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. Wait, wait, the 1S0 term is (2*0+1)S (J=0). So, S=0, L=0, J=0 for the initial state.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the final state of the NN system (let's call it the daughter) has some state, say (2S'+1)L'J'.

But wait, the initial NN state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. After emission, the NN state would have some S', L', and J'. The emitted particle X has its own orbital angular momentum, say l, and spin, but I think the problem is focusing on the orbital part since the options give lowercase letters indicating orbital.

The key points are parity and angular momentum conservation.

The parity of the initial state is determined by L. Since initial L=0 (S state), the parity is (-1)^L = 1. When X is emitted, the parity of the entire process must be considered.

Wait, the parity of the product of the initial state and X must equal the parity of the final NN state and X. Because parity is multiplicative. So, Parity_initial * Parity_X = Parity_final_NN * Parity_X'.

Wait, no, actually, the process is: initial state (NN) has parity P_initial. Emission of X (which has intrinsic parity P_X) would lead to the final state (NN) having parity P_final. The parity of the process is the product of the initial parity and the parity of
