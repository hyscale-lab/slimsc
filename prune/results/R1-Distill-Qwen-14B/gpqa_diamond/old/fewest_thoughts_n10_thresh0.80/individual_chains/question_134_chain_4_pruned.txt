Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with a base, usually measured in kilojoules per mole.

The problem says I need to calculate the enthalpy when mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, wait, that's three solutions, but usually, neutralization is between an acid and a base. So I think the HCl and H2SO4 are the acids, and Ba(OH)2 is the base here.

Wait, I should write down the reaction. Let me think. The acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2. So the reaction should involve the acids neutralizing the base. The general reaction for these would be acid + base â†’ salt + water.

But each acid reacts differently. HCl is a strong acid and will donate one H+ per molecule. H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, but it can donate two H+ ions because it's diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each molecule has two OH- ions. So when H+ from the acids reacts with OH-, that forms water.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each H+ and OH- available.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

First, HCl
