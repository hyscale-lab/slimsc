Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's typically an addition reaction. But wait, ketones usually form cyanohydrins when they react with CN-. The cyanohydrin formation involves adding CN- to the carbonyl group. But for that, the conditions are important. I think it's done in a strongly acidic condition because the mechanism involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So maybe reagent A is an acid like H3O+ or something else.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, that structure suggests that the CN added to the carbonyl carbon, and the OH came from the oxygen. So yeah, that's a cyanohydrin. So the first step uses NaCN as the nucleophile and an acid catalyst, probably H3O+ as in option A or B. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes, other acids like H2SO4 or HCl are used, but the options here have H3O+ and others. So if the first reaction is using H3O+, then A would be that.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually involves strong acidic conditions and heat. Alternatively, maybe using HCl and water under reflux? Or perhaps another acid like H2SO4.

Wait, but in the presence of water, nitriles can undergo hydrolysis. The reaction conditions depend on whether it's acidic or basic. In acidic conditions, it goes to a carboxylic acid. In basic, it goes to a carboxylate.

So, the second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid, so it's hydrolysis under acidic conditions. But what reagent B is? The options for B are HCl or CH3COOH. Let's see the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl
Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH
Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl
Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So for the second reaction, if the reagent is HCl, then that's acid. Alternatively, using CH3COOH as an acid.

Wait, but in hydrolysis, the acid is often used as a catalyst. So, for the second step, maybe HCl is the acid. Or perhaps another acid like sulfuric acid, but those options don't have that. So
