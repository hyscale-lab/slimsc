Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's take it step by step. The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a bit of a mouthful. I think I should draw the structure to visualize it better.

So, cyclohexan-1-one means there's a ketone group on carbon 1. Then, at position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so -CH2OH). And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH3)-, attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 5.

Now, step one: treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So I think this is an alkylation reaction. Where would the deprotonation occur?

Looking at the starting molecule, the ketone is at position 1. The hydroxymethyl at position 3 has an -OH group, which is acidic. But wait, when the ketone is present, the alpha hydrogens are more acidic. In this case, the hydroxymethyl is attached to the cyclohexane ring, which is adjacent to the ketone. So the alpha position here is the carbon next to the ketone.

Wait, the structure is cyclohexan-1-one, so the carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. The hydroxymethyl is at C3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The numbering is 1 (ketone), 2, 3 (hydroxymethyl), 4, 5 (propenyl), and 6.

So, the alpha carbons would be C2 and C6, because those are adjacent to the carbonyl. Would the hydroxymethyl (C3) be an alpha position? No, because it's two carbons away. So the acidic protons in this molecule are likely the alpha hydrogens at C2 and C6.

Sodium hydride would deprotonate one of these alpha positions. Then, benzyl bromide would alkylate it. So the product after step 1 (product 1) would have a benzyl group added to either C2 or C6.

Wait, the starting compound has a ketone, so the alkylation would occur at the alpha position. Let me imagine the structure. The cyclohexanone has the ketone. Deprotonating at C2 would give a carbanion, which would then react with benzyl bromide to add a benzyl group.

But wait, sodium hydride is a strong base. It would deprotonate the most acidic hydrogen first. The alpha hydrogens (C2 and C6) are more acidic than, say, the hydroxymethyl's H. So the alkylation would occur at either C2 or C6, not at the
