Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. They're all being mixed together, and I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given in both kcal and kJ, so I guess I have to be careful about the units.

Wait, wait. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but that's when it's between one mole each. But here, there are multiple acids and one base, so I need to figure out the limiting reagent.

Let me break it down. First, identify the acids and the base. HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. So, when they mix, acids will donate H+ and the base will donate OH-.

But wait, since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, each mole can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, each mole can provide two OH- ions because its formula is Ba(OH)2. So, the reaction will involve the H+ from the acids and OH- from the base.

So, I think the first thing I need to do is calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, determine which is the limiting reactant.

Let's start with HCl. The formula is HCl, so each mole gives one H+. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. That contributes 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Therefore, H+ contributed is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L, molarity 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So for every mole of H+ and OH- that reacts, one mole of H2O is formed, releasing heat.

So the H+ available is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 is less than 0.28.

So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over. The amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard enthalpy
