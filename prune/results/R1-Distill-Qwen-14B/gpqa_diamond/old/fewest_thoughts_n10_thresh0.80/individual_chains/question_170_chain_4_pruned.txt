Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation is a two-component spinor, right? So the state is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. So the spinor χ is:

χ = [3i, 4]^T.

And they want the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩.

But wait, what's S_y in terms of the Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices σ. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, given in the question as:

σ_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So to find ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute χ† S_y χ.

Let me write down the steps. First, compute χ†, which is the conjugate transpose of χ. χ is [3i, 4]^T, so χ† is [ -3, 4* ] where * denotes complex conjugate. Wait, 4 is real, so χ† is [ -3, 4 ].

So χ† is a row vector: [ -3, 4 ]

Then, S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y, so σ_y is the matrix with 0 and -i in the top right, and i and 0 in the bottom left.

So let me compute χ† σ_y χ. Then multiply by ħ/2 to get the expectation value.

So let's calculate χ† σ_y χ:

First, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So χ is a column vector:

[3i]
[4 ]

So χ† σ_y is the row vector [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y.

Wait, matrix multiplication: χ† is [ a, b ] and σ_y is 2x2. So χ† σ_y is [ a*σ_y_row1, a
