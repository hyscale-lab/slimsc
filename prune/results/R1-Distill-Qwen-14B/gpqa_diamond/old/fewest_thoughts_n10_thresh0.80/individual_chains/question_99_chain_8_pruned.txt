Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which have a carboxylic acid group (since they all end with COOH). So, the first thing to note is that the presence of a carboxylic acid would affect both the IR and NMR spectra.

Looking at the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around here are usually due to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which makes sense for the carboxylic acid group as well.

Now, the 1H NMR part. The problem states that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that means the compound doesn't have any double bonds, which makes sense because the options all seem to have single bonds except maybe for any possible ring structures, but I don't see any rings in the options.

Looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me break that down. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. Each splitting tells you about the number of adjacent protons.

A doublet of triplets of quartets (let's call that D of T of Q) would imply that each proton is next to a group that splits it into a doublet, which is then split by another group into triplets, and then another into quartets. So that's three different coupling constants, each adding more splitting.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the structure of each option and the expected NMR signals.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3 attached to a carbon which is connected to two CH3 groups. Then another CH which is attached to two CH3 groups. Then COOH.

Wait, more accurately:

The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central two carbons each have a hydrogen and two methyl groups attached. So each of those central Hs would have neighboring Hs.

Wait, no. Let me draw it. The structure is:

CH3CH2–C(H)(CH3)–C(H)(CH3)–COOH.

So the two middle carbons each have a CH that's connected to a CH3 and another substituent. So each of these CH groups would have adjacent protons. Let me think about the neighboring groups.

Each CH group (the ones attached to the two middle carbons) has a hydrogen. These two Hs are on adjacent carbons. So each H on the first CH would be next to the H on the adjacent CH, and perhaps other substituents.

Wait, but the two middle carbons each have a CH and two CH3 groups. Or wait, maybe the structure is ((CH3)2CH)–CH–(CH3)2? No, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal di-substitution. No, each CH is attached to two CH3 groups. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look at each option's structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH.

So the middle carbons each have a H and two ethyl groups. So each of these Hs would have neighboring Hs on adjacent carbons.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH2CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–COOH.

Same as option B but the chain is longer at the beginning.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3–C(H)(CH3)–C(H)(CH3)–CH2–COOH.

So, the two middle carbons each have a H and a CH3 group on each, and the last part is CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH2CH3
