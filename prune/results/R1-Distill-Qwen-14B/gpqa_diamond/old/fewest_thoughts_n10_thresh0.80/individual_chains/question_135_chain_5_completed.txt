Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about the decay of a boson, X. The question is asking which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The given options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). So that looks like an interaction term. The boson X is interacting with fermions. The λ must be the coupling constant.

I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions. The rule is that the total energy of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion's mass must be less than half the mass of X. Because when the fermions are produced, they have to each have some kinetic energy, right? So the rest mass energy of each must be less than or equal to X's mass divided by two.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the possible fermions.

Fermions include quarks and leptons. Let's list their masses:

- Up (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): 95-100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV
- Leptons:
  Electron (e-): 0.511 MeV
  Muon (mu-): ~105.7 MeV
  Tau (tau-): ~1.78 GeV
  Neutrinos are negligible, but the problem might not include them as they are not in the options.

So, for a decay X → f f̄, each f must have m_f < M_X / 2. Because the minimum energy needed is when the fermions are at rest, so 2 m_f ≤ M_X.

M_X is 6 GeV, so M_X/2 is 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV? Let's list them:

u: 2.2 MeV - yes
d: 4.7 MeV - yes
s: ~100 MeV - yes
c: ~1.5 GeV - yes
b: ~4.5 GeV - wait, 4.5 GeV is more than 3? Oh 4.5 is greater than 3 GeV. Because 3 GeV is 3000 MeV. 4.5 GeV is 4500 MeV. So b quarks are out.

Similarly, top quark is way too heavy. So top is out.

Leptons:

e-: 0.511 MeV - yes
mu-: 105.7 MeV - yes
tau-: ~1.78 GeV - that's 1780 MeV, which is less than 3000 MeV, so yes.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. Wait, but what about the neutrinos? The problem doesn't include them, and the options don't have them either, so we can ignore.

Wait, the interaction term is λf ψ_f, but wait, the interaction must conserve all quantum numbers and be allowed by the Lagrangian. The interaction term is -λ f f̄ X. So the boson X is coupling to fermions, assuming it's a Yukawa interaction.

Wait, Yukawa interactions are f̄ X f, so X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So for X to decay, it can go into any fermion pair where the fermion is lighter than 3 GeV.

So possible decay products are pairs of u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau tau, e+ e-.

But wait, as mentioned earlier, the b quark's mass is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So you can't have X→ b bbar because 2*m_b would be over 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau tau, mu mu, e e.

Wait, option B includes c. Let's check the mass of c: about 1.5 GeV. So 2c would be 3 GeV, which is exactly M_X. So that's allowed. So yes, X can decay into c cbar.

Wait, but let me check the options more carefully. Option B says c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. So all these fermion pairs are allowed because their masses are under 3 GeV.

Wait, but top quarks are out. What about the charm quark? 1.5 GeV is under 3, so 2*1.5=3 GeV, which matches M_X. So yes, possible.

So option B includes c, which is allowed, and excludes b, which is correct.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so t tbar is impossible. So C is wrong.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me check the actual options again.

Option A: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, e. So including b, which is 4.5 GeV, which is over 3 GeV. So no.

Option B: X→ c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All their masses are under 3 GeV. So this is allowed.

Option D: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, including b, which is too heavy.

Wait, but wait. What about the tau? Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2 times that is ~3.56 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 6 GeV? Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. I think I might have messed up the calculation.

Wait, the X is 6 GeV. So each fermion must be less than 3 GeV. Because when X is at rest, the maximum mass each fermion can have is 3 GeV, so that 2*3 =6 GeV.

Tau's mass is about 1.78 GeV, so each tau is about 1.78. So 2 * 1.78 is ~3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 3 GeV. Wait, but 3.56 is more than 3, but the X is 6 GeV. So 2*1.78 =3.56, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait, no, 3.56 is less than 6. Wait, wait, no, 3.56 is less than 6, so 2*m_tau =3.56 <6. So that's allowed. Hmm, so tau can be produced because their combined mass is less than X's mass.

Wait, no, the threshold for a decay is when the sum of the rest masses is less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the sum of the rest masses must be less than the mass of X. But since X is at rest, the sum of the rest masses of the two fermions must be less than or equal to X's mass.

So for X → f f̄, the sum of the rest masses is 2m_f.

So 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So for tau, 2m_tau = 2 *1.78 ≈3.56 GeV. Since m_X is 6 GeV, 3.56 ≤6, so yes, that's allowed. So tau can be produced.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, each fermion's mass must be less than m_X/2. Because if each is m, then 2m ≤ M_X, so m ≤ M_X/2.

So for tau, 1.78 <3 GeV → yes.

So all the fermions in option B are allowed.

Wait, but wait, the interaction term is given. The interaction term is -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, is the Yukawa coupling to all these fermions present? Because the Lagrangian is given as: L(y) = -λf f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, maybe I should double-check the notation.

Wait, the term seems to be written as -λf f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, perhaps it's the Yukawa interaction term where ψ_f is the fermion field. Oh, perhaps the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f.

So in that case, the X field can couple to any ψ_f in the theory. So the X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to.

But wait, the given interaction term is specific. Let me parse the Lagrangian again. The term is written as -λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, perhaps that's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be something like λ ψ_f^† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y), which would make sense as a Yukawa coupling. Because the Yukawa term is usually L = - g ψ^† ϕ ψ, where ϕ is the scalar (boson) field, and g is the coupling.

Assuming that the interaction is Yukawa-like, the X boson can decay into any fermion that it couples to. So the question is, which fermions are included in the interaction.

Wait, the interaction is given as -λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, perhaps f is a scalar field, and f̄ is the conjugate, but that doesn't make sense because X is a boson. Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as a product of two fermion fields and the X. But perhaps it's a typo and should be ψ_f^† instead of f f̄?

Wait, perhaps the correct term is -λ ψ_f^† (y) X(y) ψ_f (y). So the X couples to ψ_f. So as long as the interaction is present for a fermion ψ_f, X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f bar.

So in this case, the possible decay modes are all the fermions that the X couples to and are kinematically allowed.

But the given Lagrangian is a bit unclear. Let me think: the term is -λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, if f is a field, perhaps it's actually ψ_f, so perhaps the term is λ ψ_f^\dagger (y) X(y) ψ_f (y), but that would make sense for a Yukawa coupling.

Alternatively, maybe f is a scalar field, but then X is a boson, so the term would be ψ_f^† X ψ_f.

Assuming that, then the X can decay into any ψ_f as long as the mass allows.

So the possible fermions are all the ones that the X couples to. But the problem doesn't specify which fermions are in the Lagrangian. Wait, the problem says the interaction is given by that term, but perhaps the correct interpretation is that X couples to all the fermions listed in the options.

Wait, if the Lagrangian is written as including all possible fermions (like all quarks and leptons), then the decay possibilities are all the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV.

But looking back, the interaction term as written seems to have a general form, implying that X couples to all fermions (since ψ_f is a general fermion field). So any fermion can be produced, as long as the kinematic conditions are met.

So the possible decay channels are any fermion-antifermion pair where each fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV.

So which fermions are those?

u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau, and their antiparticles.

So the possible decay channels are X → uū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option D includes b, which is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, the tau pair. Each tau is 1.78 GeV, so two taus sum to 3.56 GeV, which is less than X's mass of 6 GeV. So yes, tau is allowed.

So the correct decay modes are all the fermion pairs with masses less than 3 GeV. So in the options, option B is the one that includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the options again to make sure.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau tau, mu mu, e e.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones. So option B is the correct answer.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided, \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), suggests a Yukawa-like coupling between the boson \( X \) and fermions \( \psi_f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total rest mass of the decay products must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the relevant fermions are as follows:
- \( u, d, s, c \): Quarks with masses \( 2.2 \, \text{MeV}, 4.7 \, \text{MeV}, 95 \, \text{MeV}, 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively, all less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
- \( b \): Bottom quark with mass \( 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( b \bar{b} \) decay is forbidden.
- \( e, \mu, \tau \): Leptons with masses \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV}, 105.7 \, \text{MeV}, 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively, all less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
- \( t \): Top quark with mass \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeding \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( t \bar{t} \) decay is forbidden.

From this analysis, the allowed decay channels are \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \). 

Now, evaluating the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden because \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels.

Answer: B
