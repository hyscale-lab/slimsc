Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'll need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But in the lab frame, where the chamber is, the particle would be moving, so its lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. Oh, right, time dilation formula: τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So I'll need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ. Lorentz factor is gamma equals total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But wait, in units where c=1, that's just E/m. So here, E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41... Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, which is less than 27. 3.41 times 8 is 27.28. Oh, wait, 3.41 *8 = 27.28. So 27 is just slightly less than that. So 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.91. Hmm, let me compute that more accurately.

3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 minus 23.87 is 3.13. 3.13 / 3.41 is about 0.917. So total is 7.917 approximately. So γ ≈ 7.92.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that: 7.92 * 8 = 63.36. So τ ≈ 63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. 8e-16 multiplied by 7.92 is 63.36e-16 s, which simplifies to 6.336e-15 s. Yeah.

Now, the particles are moving at a velocity close to the speed of light, so their speed is v ≈ c. So the distance they travel before decaying is approximately v * τ. So the mean path length, L = v * τ. Since v is roughly c, which is 3e
