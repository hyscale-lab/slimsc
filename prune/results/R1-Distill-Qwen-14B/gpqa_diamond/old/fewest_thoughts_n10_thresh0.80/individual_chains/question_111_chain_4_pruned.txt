Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. Let me take this step by step.

The first reaction is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The compound given is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 are substituted: position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, no, the numbering: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Wait, no. The substituents are at positions 2, 2, and 6. So the 2 position has two substituents: an ethyl and a methyl group. And position 6 has a methyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. Position 2 has ethyl and methyl substituents, and position 6 has methyl. So the substituents are: at C2, ethyl and methyl; C6, methyl. Let me visualize that.

t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So this might be a Claisen or aldol condensation reaction. Since we're using ethyl acrylate, which is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, perhaps this is a Michael addition or a conjugate addition.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with an enolate under basic conditions, but ethyl acrylate is an acrylate. Maybe it's a Michael addition. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition to the cyclohexanone.

Wait, the cyclohexanone has a ketone group. The ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-uns
