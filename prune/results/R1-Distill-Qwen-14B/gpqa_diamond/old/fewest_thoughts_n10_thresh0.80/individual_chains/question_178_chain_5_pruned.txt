Okay, so I've got this problem about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants is important for renormalizability. Renormalizable theories have couplings with mass dimension less than or equal to 4? Or wait, no, I think it's that the interaction terms in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because each term in the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions, right?

Wait, no, the Lagrangian itself has to be dimensionless. Because in the action, it's integrated over d^4x, which has dimension [mass]^−4. The action is dimensionless, so the Lagrangian density must have dimension [mass]^4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So for the given Lagrangian term, L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, I need to find the mass dimension of each component and then solve for κ's dimension.

Let's break it down. The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac field ψ has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So ψ̄, which is the adjoint, also has dimension 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not operators with dimensions. So σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is a commutator of two γ matrices. So each term in σ_{μν} is a product of two γ matrices, but since it's a commutator, the overall dimension is zero—same as the gamma matrices themselves. So σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1. The field strength is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each derivative has dimension 1. Each term in F^{mu nu} is ∂A, so dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So F^{mu nu} has mass dimension 2.

Now putting it all together: L_int has terms κ times ψ̄ (dimension 3/2) times σ_{mu nu} (dimension 0) times ψ (3/2) times F (2). So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2? Wait, let me calculate that again.

Wait, ψ̄ has 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the product is (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2? Wait, 3/2 * 3/2 is 9/4, times 2 is 9/2, so 4.5. So the total dimension is 9/2. But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the coupling κ must make this term have dimension 4.

So the equation is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4. So [κ] + (3/2 + 3/2 + 0 + 2) ) = 4. Wait, wait, no: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So adding these exponents: 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = (3 +3 +4)/2 = 10/2=5. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1. So mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the product of the fields is ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}. So each ψ is (3/2), and F is 2. So (3/2 + 3/2 + 0 + 2) = 3/2 *2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the term without κ is dimension 5. To make the Lagrangian term dimension 4, κ must contribute [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So yeah, [κ] = -1.

Wait, but then the next part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizable theories require that the couplings have mass dimension ≤ 4. Wait, no, actually, the dimension of the coupling is related to the superficial degree of divergence. Wait, the renormalizability condition is that the coupling constant has a mass dimension ≤ 4−d, where d is the spacetime dimension? No, wait. Wait, in 4 dimensions, a coupling with negative mass dimension would indicate a non-renormalizable interaction. Because the coupling is dimensionful, and higher-dimensional operators are non-renormalizable.

Wait, generally, an interaction term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4 for the theory
