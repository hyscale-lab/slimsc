Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question has three parts, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C from the given reactants and conditions.

Let me start by recalling what sigmatropic rearrangements are. I think they involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds, right? Like, the pi bonds migrate into the sigma bond structure. Examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I remember are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But wait, are all sigmatropic rearrangements [3,3] shifts? Hmm, no, I think they can vary, like [1,3], [2,3], etc., but the most common ones are [3,3].

Looking at the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol with H+ and heat. So, the reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine and an allylic alcohol. I need to figure out what product A is.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... that structure. So, the amine is on carbon 1, and there's a methoxy group on the same carbon. So, structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or maybe it's N,N-dimethoxyethylamine? No, wait, the formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine, so the amine is on C1, and the two methoxy groups are on C1 as well. So, the structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2.

The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH
