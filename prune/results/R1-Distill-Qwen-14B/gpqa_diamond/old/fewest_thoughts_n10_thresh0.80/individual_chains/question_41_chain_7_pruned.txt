Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, there's some sort of addition to the velocity. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Oh right, this might relate to how velocities add in different reference frames, maybe using the relativistic velocity addition formula?

Wait a second, but the medium is moving, so how does that affect the light's speed in that medium? I think the speed of light in the medium is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So v_light_in_medium = c/n. But wait, c is given as 1 here, so v_light = 1/n.

But wait, the glass itself is moving. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So I think I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame, considering both the light's speed in the medium and the medium's motion.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think the key is to consider how the velocities add up. So the light's speed in the glass is 1/n relative to the glass. But the glass is
