Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying numbers of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's very broad, maybe it's a hydrogen bond, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid. But wait, I'm not sure. Another possibility is an alcohol, but the broadness suggests maybe something more acidic like a carboxylic acid.

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated or something else. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds. Wait, but the 1700 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl. What other groups have strong peaks around 1700? Maybe an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, a carbonyl can have two peaks if there's an conjugated system. Like maybe a conjugated carbonyl, which would lower the wavenumber a bit. So if there's a carbonyl at 1700 and another peak at 1650, perhaps it's something with conjugated carbonyls, like a diketone or maybe an ester with conjugated carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe one is a ketone and the other is an aromatic ring (like C=C stretch). No, wait, C=C is usually around 1600-1650. So 1650 could be that. But in that case, why would there be a 1700? Maybe an ester group, which has the carbonyl around 1700, and maybe an adjacent double bond, like in an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated structure. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond. That suggests maybe an alkene is present. So perhaps the compound is something like an ester with a double bond nearby, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. So I need to think about what fragments give a mass of 45. Common fragments at 45 include maybe the CH3O group or other small ions. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something like CH3O (which is 31?), wait no. Wait, 45: let's think about possible fragments. For example, a fragment of (CH3)2CO is 58 (but that's not 45). Wait, another possibility: maybe a ketene ion? No, that's 28. Alternatively, the fragment could be a carbonyl group with adjacent structures. Or perhaps it's a CH3CO group, but that's 43. Hmm. Alternatively, the fragment could be a (CH2) something. Wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of a CH2Cl group? No, Cl is 35.5, so 12 + 2 +35.5 is 49.5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a COO- group, but that's 44. Wait, 45 could be a fragment where a methyl group is attached to something else. Like perhaps a CH2O group attached to something else. Or maybe a CH2CH2O fragment? Hmm. Alternatively, thinking about common ions: 45 could be a (CH2)2O group? No, (CH2)2O is 44. Or maybe it's a CH3COH group? Let me calculate: C(12) + H3 (3) + COH (which is 12+16+1) = 12 +3 +29=44. Hmm, that's 44, not 45.

Wait, another approach: what if the parent ion is losing a larger fragment, leaving behind a smaller one. For example, if the molecular ion loses a group with a molecular weight of (M - 45), what would that imply? Well, the molecular formula is one of the options, so perhaps we can calculate the molecular weight and see.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) =72 +12 +32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. 72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular ions would be at m/z 116, 98, 114, 100 respectively.

If the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, then that's a piece of the molecule. Let's consider each option:

Option A: C6H12O2 (116). If the molecule loses a fragment of 71 (116 -45=71), what would that be? 71 is the mass of C3H7O? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's the loss of a larger group leaving a smaller fragment.

Wait, another approach. Common fragments include the tropylium ion (C7H7+) which is 91, but that's not 45. Maybe a fragment like (CH2)3O+ would be 45? Let me calculate: (3*14) +16 = 42 +16=58. No. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketone group. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, maybe when it fragments, it breaks off a small part.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone (44, no, 12*3 + 3*1 +16= 36+3+16=55). Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a formyl group (HCO-) which is 29. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group. Let me calculate that: 2 carbons, 4 hydrogens, and an oxygen. 2*12=24, 4*1=4, 16=16. Total 24+4+16=44. Close but not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH3O group, which would be 45 (CH2CH3O is 15 (CH2) +15 (CH3) +16 O? No, wait: CH2CH3O is actually (12*2 + 3*1) +16 = 24 +3 +16=43. Not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group with some attached hydrogens. Like, perhaps if the molecule has a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Let me think. If the molecule is something like an ester, like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a loss of a larger group. For example, in the case of a molecule with an ester group, when it fragments, it can lose an ester group, leaving behind a smaller fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's a McLafferty rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's think about the functional groups. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H. So the compound likely has an -OH group. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol (broad peak) or a carboxylic acid (broad and strong). The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ could be two carbonyl groups. Wait, but for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, and the -OH is very broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester (carbonyl at ~1700) and perhaps another carbonyl from something else, but that's less common.

Wait, maybe the 1700 is an ester carbonyl, and the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl? Or perhaps it's a ketone. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Looking back, the 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so there's an alkene in the molecule. So the structure likely has both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

Wait, another thought: could the compound be a cyclic ester, like a lactone? Because that would have a carbonyl and an O in the ring. But I'm not sure if that fits the data.

Alternatively, the presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests perhaps two different carbonyl groups. But that's less common. More likely, perhaps, one carbonyl and another functional group.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: the 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, and the 1650 cm⁻¹ is an aromatic ring (C=C stretch). But if the molecule has an aromatic ring, why would the H NMR show vinyl hydrogens? Unless it's an aliphatic alkene.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe it's an alkenyl group, not aromatic.

So, putting this together: the molecule has an O-H group (from the broad peak), a carbonyl group (from 1700), and a double bond (from the vinyl Hs in NMR). The mass spec shows a peak at 45.

Let me consider each option:

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114.

If it's C6H10O2, what could that structure be? Maybe a diester? Or an ester with another functional group. Alternatively, perhaps an ester with a double bond.

Wait, if the structure is an ester, like R-O-CO-R', and if there's a double bond nearby, then perhaps during fragmentation, a small ester group breaks off. For example, if the ester is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2..., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one DoU could be a ring and/or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. So two DoU: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (14 -10)/2=2.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU= (14-12)/2=1.

So, from the NMR, there's a double bond (vinyl Hs), which uses one DoU. Also, the FTIR suggests a carbonyl group, which is another DoU. So for the compound, if there's a double bond and a carbonyl, that's two DoU. So which options have at least two DoU?

Options B and C have DoU of 2. Options A and D have DoU of 1. So the possible options are B and C.

So, the correct formula must be either B or C.

Now, let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at 45.

What's the molecular weight of each option:

Option B: 98.

Option C: 114.

If the fragment is 45, then the possible parent ions would be 45 + something. For example, in option B, 98, so if a fragment is 45, the parent would lose 53. But 53 isn't a common fragment. Alternatively, the fragment might be a part of the molecule.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion (M) is the largest peak, but sometimes a fragment is more prominent. The peak at 45 could be a prominent fragment.

So, let's look at each possible formula and see if any of them would produce a fragment of 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's think about possible fragments. If the molecule is an ester, like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that would be longer). Alternatively, maybe it's something like a diester or a cyclic ester.

Alternatively, let's think of a specific example. For instance, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which would have the formula C4H6O2. But our options are C6H10O2. So perhaps a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe a substituted ester with a double bond.

In such a molecule, during fragmentation, the molecule might break into smaller parts. For example, the ester group could cleave, leading to a smaller fragment. If the molecule is something like RCOOR', the ester could break into RCOO+ and R'–. Alternatively, other cleavage points.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule is a beta-keto ester, like ethyl acetoacetate, which is CH3COCH2COOEt. Its molecular formula would be C5H8O3. Hmm, that's not our case. But maybe a similar structure.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could come from a part of the molecule. Let's consider the molecular formula of the fragment: 45 = 12a + 1b +16c. Let's find integers a, b, c that satisfy this.

Possible combinations:

- a=3, then 36. Remaining 9. Let's see 9 could be 16*0.56, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps a=2: 24 + b +16c =45 → 24 +b +16c=45 → b+16c=21.

Looking for c=1: 16 → b=5. So formula is C2H5O. That's possible. So the fragment could be C2H5O.

But what would that be? Maybe an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would have a molecular weight of 45? Let's calculate: O (16) + C2H5 (29) → 16+29=45. Yes, that adds up. So the fragment could be an ethoxy group, m/z 45.

So if the molecule has an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), then during fragmentation, it might lose some part and leave the ethoxy as a fragment.

But wait, the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If the fragment is OCH2CH3 (45), then the remaining part would be C4H7O. Because 6-2=4 carbons, 10-5=5 hydrogens (wait, wait: wait, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the fragment is C2H5O (which is 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 oxygen), then the remaining would be C4H5O (since 6-2=4, 10-5=5, and O is 2-1=1). But C4H5O has a molecular weight of (4*12)+(5)+(16)=48+5+16=69. Hmm. So the molecular weight of the parent would be 45+69=114, which matches option C (114). So that could fit.

So, the fragment at 45 would be the ethoxy group. So that would support option C.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the molecule is a diester with an ethoxy group, but I'm not sure.

Let's also think about the other options. For option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight 98. If the fragment is 45, the remaining would be 98-45=53. What's 53? Maybe a propyl group or something else. Alternatively, a fragment of 53 could be something like C3H7+ (which is 53? Let's see: 3*12 +7= 36+7=43. No, that's 43. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2CH2+ group, which is 29. No, not matching. Alternatively, maybe a COO group? No, that's 44. Hmm.

But option B's molecular formula is C6H10O. So if the fragment is 45, which is C2H5O, then the remaining part would be C4H5O. But C4H5O has a molecular weight of 4*12 +5 +16=48+5+16=69. 45+69=114, which is option C, not B. So option B's molecular weight is 98, so 98-45=53, which doesn't fit a common fragment. So perhaps option B is less likely.

So, putting it all together:

FTIR: broad peak at 3000 cm-1 → O-H group, probably an ester or alcohol, but the strong 1700 suggests ester.

Also, FTIR has 1700 and 1650 → ester (1700) and perhaps a conjugated double bond (1650).

NMR shows vinyl hydrogens → double bond, so DoU requires two from the formula (options B and C).

Mass spec has a fragment at 45, which is C2H5O, suggesting an ethoxy group. So the molecule likely has an ethoxy group and another functional group (like a carbonyl as per the IR).

So the molecular formula is C6H10O2 → option C.


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest a carbonyl group (C=O), with the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak possibly corresponding to a conjugated system or an alkene. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes peaks for vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of an alkene. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which corresponds to a fragment with a molecular weight of 45, likely an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).

The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated for each option:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂):** DoU = 1 (one ring or double bond).
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O):** DoU = 2 (two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond).
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):** DoU = 2 (two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond).
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O):** DoU = 1 (one ring or double bond).

The presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond (from the IR and NMR data) requires at least two degrees of unsaturation, narrowing the options to **B (C₆H₁₀O)** and **C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**.

The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to a C₂H₅O group, likely an ethoxy group. This suggests the compound contains an ethoxy group. For **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**, the molecular formula matches a compound with an ethoxy group and a carbonyl group, consistent with the spectroscopic data. **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)** does not fit as well, as it lacks the additional oxygen required for the ethoxy group and the carbonyl group.

Thus, the compound is most consistent with **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**.

Answer: C
