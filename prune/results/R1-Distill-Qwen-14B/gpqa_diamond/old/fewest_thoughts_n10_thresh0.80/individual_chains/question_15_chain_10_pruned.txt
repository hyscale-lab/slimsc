Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both are already detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is shorterâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but same size. Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. But wait, the RV method gives us some info about the planet's mass and its orbit.

Wait, I think the transit probability is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to something else. Oh right, I think the probability P is approximately (R_p / a) * something, but maybe it's more about the orbital distance compared to the star's radius. Wait, no, transit probability isn't just that. Let me think.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. For a circular orbit, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of
