Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile plus reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. So, looking at the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? The reaction with NaCN. I remember that in the presence of a base, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. Wait, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- as a nucleophile. So, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN... I think that's a ketone nucelophilic addition. But under what conditions?

Wait, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be CH2(CO2H)(CN)CH3? No, wait. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butane is four carbons. The nitrile group is on the second carbon, which is also the position of the ketone in butan-2-one. So, the reaction replaces the ketone oxygen with a hydroxyl and a nitrile group.

Wait, no, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, maybe it's a substitution of the carbonyl group.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. So, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh wait, yes! I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and then perhaps a proton is transferred to form the hydroxyl group. But wait, wait, how does that happen.

Cyanohydrin formation typically uses a strong base. Because the carbonyl is attacked by CN-, which is a good nucleophile, but in a ketone, the carbonyl is electrophilic. So, perhaps the mechanism is: the ketone reacts with CN- to form the tetrahedral intermediate, and then in acidic conditions, it protonates and then loses water, but wait, that's more like the formation of a secondary alcohol. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, but what's the general reaction for forming a cyanohydrin? Oh, right, the reaction of a ketone with NaCN in the presence of a strong base, like NaOH, and maybe some acid workup. Or wait, maybe the base helps deprotonate something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the ketone reacting with an acid-c
