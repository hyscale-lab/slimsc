Okay, so I've got this question about textiles and the color of light they absorb. Hmm. Let me try to think this through. So, the question says that a textile dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the question says "emits light with energy", but I remember that when a compound absorbs light, it's because it's excited electrons, right? Oh wait, wait. I think I might be getting confused here. Let me re-read the question.

The question: A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?

Wait, no, the question says the dye emits light. So, when a dye emits light, that's fluorescence or something like that, right? But wait, the key here is about the energy of the emitted light and what that means for the absorbed light.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Oh, no, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Because when a molecule absorbs light, it's at a certain energy, and then maybe emits at a different energy, or maybe the light it emits is related to what it absorbed. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit muddled. So, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, when a dye absorbs a photon, it excites an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, when that electron relaxes, it emits a photon with energy corresponding to the energy difference. But wait, sometimes the emitted light is at a lower energy than the absorbed, because some energy is lost as heat or something. So, the wavelength (or color) of the absorbed light is different from the emitted.

Wait, but in this question, the organic compound emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So what color does that correspond to?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. Because the question says, "what color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?" So the dye emits light, but the question is about what it absorbs.

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, no, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think: when a dye emits light, it's typically because it's a fluorescent material. But more commonly, when we talk about dyes, they absorb light and then emit it as a different color. So the absorbed light is one color, and the emitted light is another.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light of a certain energy. So the emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV. Then, the question is about what color the compound absorbs. Hmm. So, perhaps the compound absorbs a higher energy photon, which is converted into the emitted photon.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted. Let's think about what the energy values correspond to.

Energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength. So higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (like blue/violet), lower energy to longer wavelengths (red, orange, etc.).

So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, what color is that? Let me calculate the wavelength. E = 2.3393 eV. Let's convert that to Joules. Since 1 eV is 1.602 x10^-19 J. So 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.746e-19 J.

Now, using E=hc/λ, so λ = hc/E.

h is 6.626e-34 J*s, c is 3e8 m/s.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.746e-19) = let's compute that.

Multiply numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 3.746e-19: 1.9878e-25 / 3.746e-19 = approximately 5.31e-7 meters, which is 531 nm. Hmm. Wait, what color is that? The visible spectrum ranges roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). 531 nm is in the green part, but wait, wait, let me think about the actual color corresponding to 531 nm. Wait, I remember that 450-495 nm is blue, 495-570 is green, 570-590 is yellow, 590-620 is orange, 620-750 is red. So 531 is in the green range. Wait, but the options don't have green. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Hmm. So perhaps I did the calculation wrong. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the energy is 2.3393 eV. Let me compute the wavelength again.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to remember that the energy of visible light in eV corresponds to certain colors. Let me think, visible colors and their approximate eV:

- Violet: around 3 eV (since 400 nm is about 3 eV)
- Blue: ~2.5-3 eV
- Green: ~2.1-2.5 eV
- Yellow: ~2.0-2.1 eV
- Red: ~1.8-2.0 eV

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy. Alternatively, I can use the conversion formula. Let me calculate the wavelength again.

E = 2.3393 eV.

E in Joules: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = approx 3.745e-19 J.

λ = hc/E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.745e-19

So numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Denominator: 3.745e-19.

Dividing: 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 = (1.9878 / 3.745) * 1e-6.

1.9878/3.745 is approximately 0.531.

So 0.531e-6 meters = 531 nm.

So 531 nm is green. But the options don't have green. So maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the direction. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's usually a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted light. Because the absorbed photon gives energy to the molecule, maybe causing an electron to jump, and when it drops, it emits a lower energy photon (longer wavelength). So the emitted light is lower energy than the absorbed.

So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, maybe the absorbed light is higher energy, say, higher than 2.3393 eV.

But the question is, what color is absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one.

So the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (which is 531 nm, green). Then the absorbed light would be a higher energy, say, blue or violet.

Wait, but the options are A: Red, B: Violet, C: Blue, D: Yellow.

So let's see, what color corresponds to about, say, 2.8 eV or higher. Let me compute:

Energy E = 2.8 eV.

Convert to wavelength: λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8)/(2.8 *1.602e-19) )

Compute denominator: 2.8 * 1.602e-19 = 4.4856e-19.

Numerator: 1.9878e-25.

λ = 1.9878e-25 / 4.4856e-19 = approx 4.43e-7 m = 443 nm, which is blue.

Alternatively, 3.0 eV would be:

λ = hc/(3eV) = (6.626e-34 *3e8 )/(3*1.602e-19)= same as hc/(4.806e-19) = (1.9878e-25)/(4.806e-19)= approx 4.135e-7 m = 413.5 nm, which is violet.

So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green), then the absorbed light is higher energy, say, blue or violet.

The options are B: Violet, C: Blue.

So which one is it? Well, the conjugated pi system in the dye allows for extensive conjugation, so the energy gap would be smaller. Wait, because conjugation length affects the energy gap. Longer conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps. So the energy difference between excited and ground state is lower.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. So the energy absorbed would be higher, but perhaps not by much. Because the molecule may absorb a higher energy photon and then emit a lower one.

Wait, but perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the states. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

Wait, but that's a bit tricky. Let me think about the energy levels. Let's say the molecule has a ground state (low energy) and an excited state (high energy). When a photon is absorbed, the molecule's electron jumps from ground to excited state. Then, it relaxes, emitting a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between the two states.

Wait no, that's not correct. Because in that case, the emitted photon would have the same energy as the absorbed. But in reality, molecules often emit lower energy photons because some energy is lost as heat or through other processes.

Wait, but let's think again. In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) and emits a photon of lower energy (longer wavelength). So the emitted photon is at a longer wavelength than the absorbed.

So, if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (531 nm, green), then the absorbed photon must be higher energy, shorter wavelength (blue or violet).

So the question is, which option is the absorbed color. The options are B (violet) and C (blue). So which is it?

Well, 2.3393 eV is about 531 nm. To find the absorbed energy, it's higher than that. Let me see: what's the energy corresponding to violet light? Let's say around 3 eV (413 nm), which is violet. Blue is around 2.5-2.8 eV (say, 450-480 nm).

So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm (close to green), the absorbed must be higher, perhaps in blue or violet.

But the options only have violet and blue, so which one would it be?

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy absorbed must be higher. So the color absorbed is higher energy than 2.3393 eV (i.e., shorter wavelength).

So, looking at the options, violet is higher energy than blue, because violet has a shorter wavelength than blue.

Wait, no. Wait, no, violet is higher energy than blue. Because blue is around 450-495 nm, violet is 380-450 nm. So violet has higher energy than blue.

So if the emitted is 531 nm (green), the absorbed must be higher than that. So higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So the options are B) Violet (higher energy than 2.3393) and C) Blue (which is also higher than 2.3393). So which one is the correct.

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is green, so the absorbed is either blue or violet, which are both higher in energy.

But wait, the question is: what color is absorbed? So the absorbed light must be higher in energy than the emitted.

So the correct color is either B or C.

But how do we choose between blue and violet?

Hmm, perhaps we need to calculate the exact energy and see.

Wait, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm. The absorbed photon's energy would be higher, but by how much?

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe the energy of the absorbed light is the same as the energy difference between the two states. Or perhaps the energy emitted is the same as the energy absorbed. But that can't be, because then the molecule would be using the same photon, but that's not how fluorescence works.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again about energy levels. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule's electron moves from a lower energy level (ground state) to a higher energy level (excited state). Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon as it drops to a lower energy level, perhaps not the ground state, but maybe a lower excited state.

But in this case, perhaps the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon (blue or violet) and emits a lower energy photon (green).

So the absorbed photon is blue or violet, and the emitted is green.

But the question is about the absorbed color, so the answer would be either B or C.

Wait, but the question gives that the compound emits light at 2.3393 eV. The question is, what color is absorbed?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is: the color absorbed is the complementary color of the emitted color. Because when a dye emits green, it's because it absorbed the complementary color, which is magenta. But magenta isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the absorbed color is the one that, when subtracted from white light, leaves the emitted color.

Wait, but the question is about the color that the compound absorbs. So if the compound emits green light, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, say blue or violet.

Wait, but I'm not so sure about the color complement approach. Let me think: white light is a mix of all colors. When a dye absorbs certain wavelengths and reflects others, the reflected color is what we see. But in fluorescence, it's a bit different because the molecule emits light after excitation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photon is small, so the absorbed photon is just a bit higher in energy than 2.3393 eV.

But without more information, I'm not sure. So perhaps I should look for a way to relate the energy to the color.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 531 nm. The absorbed photon's energy must be higher. So let's see:

If the absorbed photon is blue, which is around 2.5-2.8 eV. Let's say 2.5 eV is blue.

So 2.5 eV would correspond to 496 nm (since E= hc/lambda, so lambda = hc/E.

Compute 2.5 eV: lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (2.5 * 1.602e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.005e-19) = approx 4.96e-7 m = 496 nm. That's blue.

So if the absorbed photon is blue (496 nm), the emitted is 531 nm (green). That makes sense because blue is higher energy than green.

Alternatively, if the absorbed is violet, say 3 eV, which is 413 nm. Then, the emitted is lower energy (longer wavelength) than that, say 531 nm.

So both blue and violet are higher energy than green. So the question is, which of the two is the absorbed color.

But the options have both B and C. Hmm. The question is, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the structure of the dye. The question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy gaps. So, the energy difference between absorbed and emitted might be smaller.

Wait, but that's not directly helpful here. Alternatively, the extent of conjugation affects the energy levels. More conjugation lowers the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. So, the energy required to excite an electron is lower.

Wait, so for a molecule with extensive conjugation, the energy of the absorbed photon (the HOMO-LUMO gap) would be lower. So, the absorbed photon's energy would be lower than it would be for a less conjugated molecule.

Wait, but if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green, then the absorbed photon would have higher energy, unless I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this all wrong. Let's think again: the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the state from which it emits. So, if the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (blue or violet), it jumps to a higher energy state, then emits a photon of lower energy (green) when it drops to a lower excited state.

So, the absorbed color is blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Since this is the energy of the emitted light, and the question is about the absorbed color, perhaps the absorbed light is of higher energy. So, the colors higher in energy than 2.3393 eV are violet (3 eV) and blue (say, 2.5-2.8 eV).

So among the options, B is violet (higher energy than 2.3393) and C is blue (also higher), but blue would be a bit lower than violet.

Wait, but how do we decide between them?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon? No, that's not correct because in fluorescence, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. The question states that the dye contains an extensively conjugated pi system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to absorption in the visible region, perhaps red or near infrared, but that's when the molecule absorbs to a lower energy. Wait, no, extensive conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, so the absorption is at lower energy (longer wavelength) than something with less conjugation.

Wait, no, wait. Extensive conjugation increases the length of the pi system, which lowers the energy gap (HOMO-LUMO), so the absorption wavelength is longer (lower energy). So the molecule would absorb in the longer wavelengths (like red), but that seems contradictory because the emitted light is green.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

The emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV (green). The absorbed light must be higher in energy (shorter wavelength) than that, so it could be blue or violet.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which is higher in energy? Violet is higher than blue.

So the absorbed photon must be violet.

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, no. Because the energy of green is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must be higher. So, if the emitted is 2.3393, the absorbed must be higher than that.

So, a photon of, say, 2.6 eV would be blue. 3 eV would be violet.

Wait, so 2.3393 eV is green. The absorbed photon is more energetic, so either blue or violet.

But the options are both present. So perhaps I should think about the fact that the conjugated system's absorbance is in a certain region.

Wait, another thought: the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photon is the energy lost. So, if E_absorbed = E_emitted + energy_loss.

But without knowing the energy loss, I can't compute it. So I think the key is that the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But without more information, how do I choose between B and C?

Wait, the question says the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed light must have higher energy. So, looking at the options, the colors with energies higher than 2.3393 eV are violet (which is higher) and blue (which is between 2.1 and 2.8 eV, higher than 2.3393).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, blue is around 2.5-2.8 eV, which is higher than 2.3393. So both blue and violet have higher energy than 2.3393. So either B or C is possible.

But the options only provide B and C as possibilities. So the question is, which one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet. Because 2.3393 eV is green, and the absorbed is higher, which would be violet.

But another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is approximately the same as the energy of the emitted photon? That doesn't seem right because fluorescence usually emits lower energy.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. But I think the correct approach is that the absorbed light is of higher energy, so either blue or violet. Looking at the options, the only two higher are B and C.

Wait, another idea: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is in the green region. The absorbed photon's energy is higher, so it's in the blue or violet region.

But perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV plus some value. For the sake of this problem, maybe the absorbed photon is close to 2.5 eV, which is blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the complementary color. So, if the dye emits green, perhaps it absorbs magenta. But the options don't have magenta. The closest option would be violet or blue. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and the emitted light is actually the color that is absorbed, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, maybe the question is confusing. Let me re-read.

The question says: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed.

Wait, no. When a dye emits light, it's because it absorbed a photon of higher energy. So the absorbed light must be higher in energy than the emitted.

So, since the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed is higher, which could be blue or violet.

But the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

So, which one is more likely.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the typical colors absorbed by dyes. For example, many dyes absorb in the blue or violet regions and emit in the yellow or red, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the wavelength.

As I did earlier, 531 nm is green.

The absorbed photon's wavelength must be shorter than 531 nm, so it's either blue (around 450-495 nm) or violet (380-450 nm).

But which is more likely?

Well, in the visible spectrum, the energy increases as wavelength decreases.

So, for a conjugated system, the absorption maximum (lambda max) tends to be in the visible range. Extensive conjugation can cause lambda max to be in the longer wavelengths (red), but in this case, the emitted light is green, so perhaps the absorbed is in the blue or violet.

Wait, but this is getting me nowhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the color that's absorbed, which would be the one that's not emitted. But that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the color of the absorbed light. Since it emits green, the compound must absorb green's complement, which is magenta. But the options don't have that, but violet is close.

Wait, perhaps the compound absorbs violet and emits green. So the answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, the compound absorbs blue and emits green. So the answer is C) Blue.

I'm stuck. But given that the emitted is green (531 nm), the absorbed must be higher energy. So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B and C are the options. So perhaps the answer is B) Violet because it's higher in energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the photon absorbed is approximately the same as the energy of the emitted photon, but this is only true for perfect efficiency, which is not the case. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy.

But without knowing the exact energy, I'll have to choose based on the options.

In this case, I think the answer is B) Violet because the energy required to absorb and emit would require a higher energy photon to be absorbed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The compound must have absorbed a photon of higher energy, so the color is either blue or violet.

But the question is about which option is correct.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) Red (low energy, lower than green)

B) Violet (higher than green)

C) Blue (higher than green)

D) Yellow (lower than green)

So among the options, B and C are higher than 2.3393 eV.

But the question is which one. Since 2.3393 eV is about 531 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet regions.

I think the answer is B) Violet, because the energy is higher, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) Blue.

Wait, maybe I should think about the wavelengths. 531 nm is green. So the absorbed photon would be of a shorter wavelength, say about 450 nm (blue) or 400 nm (violet).

Since the question is about which color is absorbed, the answer is either B or C.

But without further information, I'm not sure. Maybe the question expects me to know that the energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to green, and the absorbed color is the complementary, which is magenta, which is close to violet. So the answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the absorbed color is the same as the emitted, but that's not how fluorescence works.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it as a simple question: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the wavelength is 531 nm (green). What color is absorbed? The absorbed color must be higher in energy (shorter wavelength) than green, so either blue or violet.

So between options B and C, which is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually about the energy of the absorbed photon, not the emitted. Because the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing.

The question says: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed.

Wait, no, the question is correct as phrased. So if the dye emits green, the absorbed must be higher energy, so the color is either blue or violet.

But the options are A) Red (unlikely, lower), B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow (lower).

So the correct answers are B and C.

But the options only include B and C as higher.

So, given that, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, because the energy required would be higher, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, if the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, perhaps the absorbed photon is in the blue region. Let me think: blue is around 2.5 eV.

So, 2.5 eV is blue, which is higher than 2.3393 eV (green). So the absorbed photon is blue.

Wait, but then the emitted would be green, which is lower than blue.

So, the answer would be C) Blue.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll have to make a choice based on the calculations.

Wait, let me calculate the energy for blue.

Blue is around 450 nm.

E = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (450e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.5e-7) = approximately 4.417e-19 J. Then, in eV, 4.417e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.756 eV.

So about 2.76 eV for blue light.

The emitted is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed is 2.76 eV, which is higher. So the absorbed color is blue.

Wait, but the emitted is 2.3393, which is lower than 2.76. So blue is the absorbed color.

So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but then what about violet? Violet is about 400 nm.

E = hc/(400e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 4e-7 = 4.9695e-19 J, which is 4.9695e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.102 eV.

So violet is about 3.1 eV.

So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed could be either blue (2.76 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

So the question is, which one is it?

But the options only include B and C as higher than 2.3393. So which of these is correct.

Well, I think the correct answer is B) Violet because the energy 2.3393 eV is in the green region, and the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the possible options are violet or blue. But without knowing the exact energy, I can't say. However, the question states that the dye has an extensively conjugated pi system, which usually absorbs in the visible region, perhaps in the blue or green.

Wait, no, extensive conjugation would lower the energy gap, so the absorption would be at longer wavelengths. Hmm, perhaps that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the conjugated system leads to lower energy absorption. So the molecule absorbs at a lower energy than a less conjugated system. But I'm not sure.

Given that, I think the correct answer is B) Violet, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I might have to go with C) Blue.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the energy of the emitted light is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted photon.

But without knowing the exact energy of the absorbed photon, I can't compute it exactly.

Therefore, given the options, B and C are possible. But I think the intended answer is B) Violet because the energy is higher.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon's energy is equal to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. So, if the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, then the energy difference is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that.

Wait, but that's only if the molecule returns to the ground state upon emitting. But in fluorescence, the molecule might drop to a lower excited state, so the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So, in that case, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the color absorbed must be either blue or violet.

But the question is which one.

I think the intended answer is B) Violet. So I'll go with B.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **531 nm** (green light). In fluorescence, the absorbed photon provides energy to excite an electron to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference when the electron relaxes to a lower energy state. Thus, the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Energy to Wavelength Conversion**:  
   The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:  
   \[
   E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.  
   For \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \):  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{(2.3393 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19})} \approx 531 \, \text{nm}
   \]  
   This corresponds to green light.

2. **Energy of the Absorbed Photon**:  
   Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, its wavelength must be shorter than **531 nm**. This places the absorbed photon in the **blue (450–495 nm)** or **violet (380–450 nm)** regions of the spectrum.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A) Red**: Red light has a longer wavelength (around 620–750 nm) and lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.  
   - **B) Violet**: Violet light has a shorter wavelength (380–450 nm) and higher energy than green, making it a valid candidate for the absorbed photon.  
   - **C) Blue**: Blue light has a wavelength of 450–495 nm and higher energy than green, also making it a valid candidate for the absorbed photon.  
   - **D) Yellow**: Yellow light has a longer wavelength (570–590 nm) and lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.

4. **Final Consideration**:  
   Both violet and blue are higher in energy than green. However, violet light has a higher energy than blue light. Given the options, **violet** is the more likely candidate for the absorbed photon, as it aligns with the higher energy requirement.

### Conclusion:
The organic compound absorbs light in the **violet** region of the spectrum.
