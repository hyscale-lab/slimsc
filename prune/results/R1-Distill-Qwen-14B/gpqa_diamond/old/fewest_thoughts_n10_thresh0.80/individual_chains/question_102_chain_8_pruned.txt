Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving gene constructs and fluorescent markers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the details, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The experiment involves creating a bicistronic vector with these two ORFs. The ligand is under the CBA promoter and fused to mCherry, and the receptor is after an IRES element and fused to eGFP. There are loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte cultures and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. On Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin, so the proteins are being expressed. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. They expected to see GFP under the microscope but didn't. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If they're only expressed in the same cell, maybe autocrine, but I don't know how that affects the fluorescent signal here. The question is about expression in the mouse, so maybe this isn't the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface. But if the antibody in the Western blot detected it, which is usually done with cell lysates, maybe it's expressed but not properly trafficked. But then why no green signal in live cells? The GFP should fluoresce if the receptor is expressed and on the cell surface.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, I think. So if the promoter was missing, ligand wouldn't be expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw signals, so the proteins are being made. So maybe the promoter is working.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But wait, in the vector, the receptor is fused to eGFP. So if the stop cassette is after the receptor, but before eGFP, the IRES would allow the receptor to be translated and then the eGFP? Or wait, the setup is a bit tricky. The ligand is at 5', with a stop in loxP, then mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with an IRES upstream, and its own stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. The first gene is ligand with loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. Then after the IRES is the receptor, followed by lox2272-stop, then eGFP. So when the vector is in the cell, the CBA promoter drives the transcription of both ligand and receptor. The ligand is expressed, then the stop cassette stops it, so mCherry is not expressed unless the stop is excised by Cre. Similarly, the receptor is expressed, but under the control of IRES, which allows internal ribosome entry, so the eGFP would be co-expressed if the stop after receptor is not in the way.

Wait, but the way the vector is set up: The stop after ligand ORF is loxP, so if Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the stop after receptor is lox2272, so when Cre is present, it'll excise that stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the mouse, they're using SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells and their progeny, like astrocytes.

Wait, but the vector is in the mouse, and they're using it in a model, so the construct is in the mouse's genome. So the Cre would be expressed, leading to the excision of the stop cassettes. So in that case, ligand is expressed, and if the stop is excised, mCherry would be expressed. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed, and if the stop after it is excised, eGFP would be expressed.

But wait, the question says they crossed the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and Cre. The Cre would recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stops, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the question, after the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal and see no green signal. So why isn't eGFP expressed? The GFP should be expressed from the receptor construct.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, how? If the stop is in the same reading frame, the eGFP would be expressed. But if the ORF isn't correctly in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed correctly. Or perhaps the frame was disrupted, so the eGFP isn't made.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop and then eGFP. If the stop is lox2272, when Cre is active, it would excise that stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be in the same transcript. But if the eGFP is in frame with the receptor, it would be a fusion protein. But in the setup, the question says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So perhaps the eGFP is a separate ORF, but under the same transcriptional unit.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs in the same transcript. The first ORF is the ligand, followed by mCherry, but separated by a loxP stop. The second ORF is the receptor, followed by eGFP, separated by a lox2272 stop.

In the presence of Cre, the loxP sites are recombined, so the ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF.
