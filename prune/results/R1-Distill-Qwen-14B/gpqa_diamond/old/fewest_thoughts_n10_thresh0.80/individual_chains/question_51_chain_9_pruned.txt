Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I need to find the net potential energy of the system. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Grounded means the sphere is connected to the earth, so any excess charge would go into the ground, right? But wait, in this case, the sphere is conducting, so charges redistribute themselves on the surface.

Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, does that mean it's neutral? Or can it have induced charges? Oh, right, when a charge is placed near a conductor, it induces opposite charges on the near side and same charges on the far side. But because the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can actually flow into the ground. So the sphere remains neutral overall because any induced charge can leave, except for the induced charge opposite to q. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have a grounded conductor and place a charge near it, the conductor's induced charges would adjust such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Since it's grounded, the conductor's potential is the same as the ground, which is considered zero. So any charges induced on the conductor would arrange themselves to achieve this.

Wait, but the sphere is neutral initially. So when you bring a charge q near it, the sphere's charges redistribute. But because it's grounded, the induced charges can't stay on the sphere; they'll flow away. So the sphere ends up with no net charge, but the induced charges have left through the ground. Hmm, so the sphere remains neutral. But wait, if the sphere is neutral, then the induced charge distribution would be such that the surface charge density depends on the external field.

Wait no, maybe the sphere must maintain its neutrality because it's grounded. Oh wait, no. If the sphere is initially neutral, and then a charge q is placed nearby, the sphere would have induced charges. But because it's grounded, any excess charge (positive or negative) can flow into the ground. So the sphere's net charge remains zero. The induced charges are on the surface, but the negative charges on the near side and positive on the far side.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe another approach. The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. Here, the system is q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge can flow away, so the sphere's potential is zero. So the potential energy would be the work done to bring charge q from infinity to point d, considering the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is neutral, so the induced charges are +σ and -σ? Or does the charge q induce opposite charges on the sphere's surface, but due to grounding, the sphere remains neutral.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere acts as a conductor and the charge q induces surface charges. Since it's grounded, any induced charges can't stay, so the sphere remains neutral. So the induced charges are such that the sphere's net charge is zero.

But wait, another thought. The potential outside a conducting sphere (due to any charges on it) can be considered as if all the charge were at the center. But if the sphere is
