Okay, so I have this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh wait, it's something about complementary colors, right?

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I think I need to find out the wavelength corresponding to that energy because that should tell me what color it emits, and then find the absorbed color from that.

I remember the formula E = hc/λ. Where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. Let me get the constants right. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. Speed of light c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. Oh, and since energy is given in eV, which I need to convert to joules. Right, 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

So, first convert the energy from eV to J. 2.3393 eV multiplied by 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me calculate that. 2.3393 * 1.602 is about... let's see, 2 * 1.6 is 3.2, 0.3393*1.6 is around 0.543, so total about 3.743e-19 J? Wait, no, wait: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19. Let me do exact calculation: 2.3393 * 1.602 = 2.3393 * 1.6 is 3.74288, plus 2.3393 *0.002 is 0.0046786. So total about 3.74756e-19 J. So E ≈ 3.74756e-19 J.

Now plug into E=hc/λ. Rearranging, λ = hc/E. Plugging in the numbers: (6.626e-34 J·s * 3.00e8 m/s) / (3.74756e-19 J). Let's compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide that by 3.74756e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.74756e-19 ≈ 5.306e-7 meters. Because 1e-7 meters is 100 nm, so 530.6 nm is the wavelength.

Wait, 530 nm is approximately green. Because red is around 700 nm, orange ~600, yellow ~570, green ~530, blue ~450, violet ~400. So 530 is green. 

But the question is about the color absorbed. Oh, wait, no. When a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits the complementary color. Or wait, I get confused. Let me think. The compound absorbs a certain photon, and then emits another. But wait, the energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between the states.

Wait, when a dye absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it returns to the ground state, it emits a photon. So the energy emitted (2.3393 eV) must be the energy difference between the states. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than emitted, or wait, no, it's the same? Wait, no. The absorbed photon provides the energy to get to the excited state, and when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon? No, wait. No, that's not right. Because the process is absorption (photon in) and then emission (photon out). But the energy absorbed is higher than the energy emitted. Because when you absorb, the molecule goes from ground state to excited state. Then, when it emits, it goes back to a lower state. So the energy of the emitted photon is the difference between the
