Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. The examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The question has three parts, each involving a reaction that likely undergoes a sigmatropic rearrangement. I need to figure out what products A, B, and C are from the given starting materials.

Let's tackle them one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol with H+ and heat. The product is A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like (CH3O)2CHNH2. But but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? No, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2 with the double bond at 3 and the OH on carbon 2. Let me draw it: it's CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 but with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 but wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or is it CH2CH=CH-OH-CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. But-3-en-2-ol: the double bond starts at C3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that can't be right. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOHCH2? Maybe it's CH2CH2CH2(OH)CH3 but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2CH2) with the double bond at position 3, and OH at position 2. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)2CH(OH)CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? Hmm, perhaps I should think about it as CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3. No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but butenol is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, but numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond. So in but-3-en-2-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4? But that's not possible because but is
