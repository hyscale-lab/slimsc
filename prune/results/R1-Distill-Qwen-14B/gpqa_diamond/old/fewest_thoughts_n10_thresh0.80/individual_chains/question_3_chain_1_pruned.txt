Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let's see. The question involves a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state, and I need to compute the expectation value of 10σz + 5σx.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩. So I need to compute this for each part of the operator and then combine them.

The state given is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me make sure. Oh right, 0.5 is 1/2, and √3/2 is approximately 0.866. But I'll work with exact values to keep it precise.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. So I can split this into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. The expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each part.

I think I should compute each expectation value separately. Let's start with σz.

I remember that σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩ because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So σz |↑⟩ = |↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

The state ψ is a linear combination, so ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=√3/2.

The expectation value ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Let me compute that.

First, |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (√3/2)^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Now, the first part of the operator is 10σz, so the expectation value is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Next, I need to find the expectation value of 5σx. Hmm. The operator σx is more tricky because it's the Pauli X matrix, and I think the expectation value for σx in the state ψ is the same as the expectation value of the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, but |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, not σx. So the state is not an eigenstate of σx. Therefore, I can't just take the expectation value directly. I'll have to compute it using the matrix representation or the expectation value formula.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx in matrix form is:

[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

The state ψ is a column vector [a, b]^T, which is [0.5, √3/2]^T.

To find ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can compute ψ^† σx ψ.

Alternatively, using the expectation value formula, it's the sum over the components. Let me write ψ as (a, b), then ψ^† is (a*, b*), but since a and b are real here, it's just (a, b).

So ψ^† σx ψ = [a b] * σx * [a; b]

Multiplying σx with [a; b] gives [b; a]. Then, [a b] times [b; a] is a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So ⟨σx⟩ = 2ab.

Wait, let me make sure. So:

σx |ψ⟩ =
