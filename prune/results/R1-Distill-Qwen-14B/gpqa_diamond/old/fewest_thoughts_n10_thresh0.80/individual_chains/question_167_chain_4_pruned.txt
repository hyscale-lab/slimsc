Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). The relative entropy measure is the difference between the von Neumann entropies of the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. So, nG is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

Wait, the problem asks for the non-Gaussianity for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The options are A to D, with D being 0. So, I'm thinking maybe when the state is Gaussian, the nG would be zero. But is this state Gaussian?

I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a Wigner function which is a Gaussian distribution. For single-mode states, coherent states and squeezed states are Gaussian. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, right? So it's a non-Gaussian state because it's a superposition of Gaussian states, leading to a non-Gaussian Wigner function with negative regions. So the state here is non-Gaussian, which might mean that the non-Gaussianity is not zero. But wait, the relative entropy compares it to a reference Gaussian state. So if the state is non-Gaussian, the entropy difference shouldn't be zero. Unless in some cases when the state is actually Gaussian despite being a superposition.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For certain values of phi and alpha, perhaps the state becomes Gaussian. When is a superposition of coherent states Gaussian? Well, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal when alpha ≠0. So their superposition would depend on the phase phi. If phi is such that the state becomes a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. So maybe when phi is 0 or pi/2?

Wait, let's see. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Let's compute N. N² = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²). For phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N² = 1 - exp(-2 alpha²). With alpha = 0.5, alpha² is 0.25, so exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Then N² = 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935, so N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state becomes [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / N. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the coefficients are 0.7071 and -0.7071, resulting in |psi> = [0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but what does this state look like? When phi is such that the phase difference between the two coherent states affects the outcome. But wait, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal, right? Because their inner product is e^{-|alpha|^2} e^{alpha * (-alpha)} }? Wait, no, the inner product is e^{ - |alpha|^2 } e^{ alpha (-alpha)* } = e^{ - |alpha|^2 } e^{- |alpha
