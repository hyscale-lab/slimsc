Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I need to figure out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, let me think about this step by step.

So, from the problem statement, both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Inertial frames are ones that are either stationary or moving at constant velocity relative to each other, right? So, no acceleration involved here. That probably means I don't have to worry about forces or gravity, which the note also says to ignore.

The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but since they're moving towards each other, that's their relative velocity. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Because in different frames, their velocities are opposite. So, if the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed towards the galaxy.

Wait, is that correct? Let's think. If you're in a train moving at velocity v relative to the ground, then someone on the ground sees you moving at v, and you see the ground moving at v in the opposite direction
