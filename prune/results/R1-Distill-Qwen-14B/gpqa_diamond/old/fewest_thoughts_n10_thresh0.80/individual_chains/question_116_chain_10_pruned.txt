Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves NMR spectroscopy, bromination, elimination reactions, and some dienol reactions. I'll need to figure out what each compound is based on the given information.

First, let's start with Compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns give information about neighboring protons. A triplet usually indicates two neighboring protons, and a quartet suggests three neighboring protons. 

Wait, 6H as a triplet. That might be from two equivalent CH3 groups next to something. And 4H as a quartet—probably from something like a CH2 next to a CH2 group. Oh, maybe a diethyl group. Because diethyl ether has two CH3 groups (each as triplets) and two CH2 groups (quartets), but wait, diethyl ether is O(C2H5)2. But the NMR here shows 6H as triplet and 4H as quartet. Oh, wait, each CH3 in diethyl ether would be a triplet because each is next to a CH2 (which has 2 H). So each CH3 would be a triplet, integrating to 3H each, so two CH3s would be 6H as a triplet. The CH2 groups would be quartets because each is next to another CH2 (with 2 H). So each CH2 would have 2H as a quartet. So two CH2 groups would be 4H as a quartet. That fits the description for Compound A. So Compound A is diethyl ether.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So each CH3 would be a triplet because they're next to CH2 (each CH2 has 2 H). Each CH2 is next to another CH2, so they're quartets. So that makes sense. So Compound A is diethyl ether.

Now, Compound A undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. Monobromination of diethyl ether—probably via an SN2 mechanism since diethyl ether is a good leaving group scenario? Wait, no, diethyl ether isn't a good leaving group. Oh wait, wait—monobromination of diethyl ether would likely be via a substitution. Since diethyl ether has two ethyl groups attached to oxygen. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, when diethyl ether undergoes monobromination, it would substitute one of the ethyl groups. But wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. Brominating it would typically require a good leaving group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction, but that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution where the oxygen is the leaving group. Wait, but O is not a good leaving group. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a different approach. Maybe the diethyl ether is treated with HBr in a substitution? Hmm, but diethyl ether's structure is symmetrical, so the substitution would occur at either end. Wait, another thought: Maybe the diethyl ether is treated with a brominating agent like Br2 under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's an SN2 reaction where the ethyl group is substituted by Br. But wait, for SN2, the leaving group is usually a good one, like a tosylate or something. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl ether is treated with HBr, leading to the formation of an alkyl bromide.

Wait, maybe it's a different approach. Let's think about diethyl ether reacting with HBr. Diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. Adding HBr would lead to substitution of one ethyl group. So, (CH2CH
