Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Hmm, the degrees of unsaturation might help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds, so 3 degrees), then maybe another double bond or ring, plus a nitrile or an amide or something.

Now, looking at the IR data. They have strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretching vibrations. So that suggests there's an amine or an amide group. But wait, the 3420 is a medium band, which might also be from an O-H stretch, but O-H usually is broader. Or maybe it's from N-H in an amide. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl, probably an amide or ester or ketone. But considering the molecular formula, it's more likely an amide or ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's list them out:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group, so probably an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Could be adjacent to an amide group or something with hydrogen bonding. Maybe an -OCH2- group or an amine adjacent.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet suggests it's next to a CH2CH3 group. So maybe a -OCH2CH2- or a -CH2CH2-O- structure, but the 4.5 ppm is a bit high for an OCH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen. Wait, could this be an amide's CH2NH?

Wait, or perhaps it's an ethyl ester group. The ethyl ester would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (the CH2CH3) and a quartet around 4.1-4.3 for the OCH2. But the given quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than typical for an ethyl ester. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen which is connected to something else.

Looking at the aromatic protons:

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H)
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)

This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, like a substituent at position 4. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm suggests some electron-withdrawing groups, maybe an amide or ester group attached to the ring.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. One substituent could be an ethyl group attached via oxygen (like an ethoxy group), and the other could be a carbonyl-containing group,
