Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I remember ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for things like detecting exoplanets because of its precision. It's attached to the VLT, which are big telescopes, so they can collect a lot of light. The question is about signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a one-hour exposure. The requirement is S/N of at least 10.

First, I need to figure out which stars meet this condition. The stars are options a to f, and the options are A to D. The possible answers are 2,5,4,3.

Wait, the stars have different properties. Let's see each option:

a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star, maybe a magnitude around 0 or so. Bright stars would be easier to detect since they emit more light. So the S/N should be high.

b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, also pretty bright, I believe it's about magnitude 2 or maybe a bit higher. I'm not exactly sure of its current brightness, but it's a prominent star. So it might be detectable.

Options c, d, e, f have the same absolute magnitude (15 mag) but different distances. Absolute magnitude is the brightness as seen from 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude would vary based on distance. Because the farther away, the fainter the star appears.

The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude and then see how bright they are.

But how does apparent magnitude relate to S/N? I think the S/N depends on the star's brightness because a brighter star (lower apparent magnitude) means more photons, leading to higher S/N.

Wait, what's the relation between magnitude and flux? Each step in magnitude is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness. The flux f is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), where m is the apparent magnitude.

The S/N ratio in spectroscopy depends on the photon count. Higher photon counts (brighter objects) give higher S/N. The exact relation might be that S/N scales with the square root of the number of photons, but in this case, the question gives a fixed S/N threshold of 10 per binned pixel.

So, the key is to determine for each star whether it's bright enough to reach S/N >=10 in 1 hour.

I need to find out if each star's apparent magnitude is such that, with ESPRESSO and the VLT, the S/N per pixel is at least 10.

But wait, how do I calculate the S/N? I think the formula for signal-to-noise ratio in an exposure is based on the number of photons collected. The formula is S/N = (N_photons) / sqrt(N_photons), which simplifies to sqrt(N_photons). So S/N is proportional to the square root of the number of photons.

But the number of photons depends on the star's flux, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the exposure time.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ESPRESSO's specifications. Let me think. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a very high-resolution spectrograph, but it's designed to work with the VLT's 8m telescopes. It has a high efficiency, but I'm not sure of the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the concept of limiting magnitude. The limiting magnitude is the faintest star that can be detected with a certain S/N ratio in a given exposure time.

So for ESPRESSO, what's the limiting magnitude for S/N = 10 per binned pixel in 1 hour?

But I
