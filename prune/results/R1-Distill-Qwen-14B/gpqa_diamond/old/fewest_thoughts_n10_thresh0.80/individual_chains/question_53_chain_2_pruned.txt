Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's probably something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, so there's an O in an ester somewhere. Ester groups typically have carbonyl (C=O) which shows a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ in IR.

The 1H NMR has six signals. Let's look at them: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two CH3 groups. No CH2 groups, so the structure must not have any methylene groups.

Wait, di-substituted benzene can have substituents in different positions. Let's think about possible structures with an ester group. An ester is usually something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, esters are more like R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are substituents. Oh wait, no, that's a ketone or something. Wait, ester is R-O-CO-R', right. So maybe the benzene has an ester substituent, like an aryl ester or an alkoxy carbonyl group.

Wait, the NMR signals: six signals. Let me think about what each signal represents.

Two aromatic protons: So the aromatic ring is di-substituted, but with symmetry, maybe. Wait, if it's di-substituted, the ring could have substituents in positions that lead to equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be two sets: the two protons adjacent to each substituent. Wait, no. Let me think: in para substitution, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. The aromatic protons would be two sets, each with two equivalent protons. So that would account for two signals, each integrating for two protons. So that fits with the two aromatic signals.

Vinyl protons: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets if they're part of a trans configuration in a double bond, or if they're adjacent to substituents that cause splitting. A doublet of quartets suggests that each vinyl proton is split by two different coupling partners. Hmm, maybe the ester group is part of a vinyl group. Like maybe it's an acrylate or something like that.

Wait, the ester is part of a vinyl group? So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an ester group attached to a vinyl group, like CH₂=CH-CO-O-R. Or maybe it's an allyl ester, like benzene-O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂- something. Wait, but that would make more CH₂ groups, but the NMR shows no CH₂ signals. Wait, the NMR says no CH₂ groups, so any CH₂ in the structure would show up as a quartet or something, but they don't. So perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent could be a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl, but that's a ketone, not an ester. Or maybe it's an acetyloxy group, like OAc (acetyloxy is an ester). So, the substituent on the benzene could be OAc, but that would mean the ester is the acetyl group. Wait, but then how does that lead to vinyl protons?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester group. Like something like CH₂=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-... No, wait, that's an ester with an ethyl group, but then we have CH₂ groups, which would show up in the NMR, but the question says no CH₂ signals. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like the ester is attached to
