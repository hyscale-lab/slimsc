Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question involves three reactions, and I need to figure out the structure of the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different stereochemistry. Alright, let's break it down.

First reaction: Cyclooctatetraene is heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1. Hmm, cyclooctatetraene is a non-aromatic eight-membered ring with alternating double bonds, I think. Maleic anhydride is a dienophile, so this sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, but cyclooctatetraene isn't a diene; it's more of a conjugated system. Or wait, is it acting as a diene here? Alternatively, maybe it's a [4+4] cycloaddition? Wait no, Diels-Alder is [4+2], so maybe cyclooctatetraene is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with something else. Wait, but maleic anhydride is a dienophile, right? So perhaps the cyclooctatetraene is undergoing some rearrangement to form a diene.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, cyclooctatetraene is a 8-membered ring with four double bonds, making it a conjugated system. Maybe when heated, it can undergo some ring-opening or form a less strained structure. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when heated, cyclooctatetraene can form a more reactive diene. Alternatively, maybe the Diels-Alder isn't the first reaction, but another type.

Wait, another thought: cyclooctatetraene is a strained molecule, so when heated, maybe
