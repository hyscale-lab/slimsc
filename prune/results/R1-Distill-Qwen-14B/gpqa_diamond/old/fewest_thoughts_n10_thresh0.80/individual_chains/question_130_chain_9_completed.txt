Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me think. I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light is stretched as it travels through the expanding universe. The higher the redshift, the more the wavelength is stretched.

The question says that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, wait. Lyman alpha emission is usually around 121.6 nm, right? Because hydrogen's Lyman series is in the UV. Oh wait, no, wait. I think the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. No, wait, wait. No, wait. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 121.6 nm is 1216 Angstroms. Yeah, that's right. So the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms.

But wait, the question is about the redshift. The quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the quasar emits light, say, in the optical or UV, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs it at 1216 Angstroms. But wait, that's the rest wavelength. So if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the wavelength we observe will be longer.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from about 400 nm to around 700 nm, maybe a bit beyond into the near-infrared, but let's say roughly 400-700 nm for this case.

So the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame. But when we observe it, it's redshifted. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1+z), where z is the redshift.

But wait, the quasar emits light that passes through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud would absorb the quasar's light at 1216 Angstroms (rest frame of the cloud). But when we observe that absorption line, it's at a longer wavelength (redshifted) because the cloud is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe.

Wait no, wait. The quasar's light is coming through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud absorbs at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. So the observed wavelength we see from the absorption line is 1216*(1+z), right? Because the cloud is at redshift z.

But the question is about whether this absorption line falls into the optical range. Because if the observed wavelength is too long, like in the infrared, an optical telescope can't see it. So we need 1216*(1+z) to be within the optical range.

Wait, but optical telescopes can observe up to about 700 nm or so. Let me convert that into Angstroms. 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no: 1 nm = 100 Angstroms. Wait, no: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 700 nm is 700 * 10 = 7000 Angstroms.

So the observed wavelength lambda_obs should be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms for an optical telescope to detect it. But wait, wait: 1216 Angstroms is already in the far UV. So when it's redshifted, it would move into longer wavelengths. So if the cloud is at z=0, lambda_obs is 1216 Angstroms, which is in the UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the quasar's light at 1216 Angstroms (from the cloud) would be in UV, which can't be detected by ground-based optical telescopes.

So the cloud's absorption line needs to be redshifted into the optical range for the ground-based telescope to see it. So we need lambda_obs to be in the optical range, say about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms).

So let's set 1216*(1+z) <=7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait, 1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength, and when it's redshifted, it's multiplied by (1+z). So 1216*(1+z) must be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms, but wait, that can't be right. Because 1216*(1+z) is the observed wavelength. So for the observed wavelength to be in the optical, it must be between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but 1216*(1+z) should be around, let's see, 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

But wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So when it's redshifted, it moves into the UV or optical.

Wait, but if the quasar is at a higher redshift, the absorption line we see from the cloud would be at a longer wavelength. So for the line to be in the optical, the redshift has to be such that 1216*(1+z) is less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, let's set up the equation:

1216 * (1 + z) <= 7000

Wait, but wait, that would give (1+z) <= 7000/1216. Let me compute that.

7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.758

So 1 + z <=5.758 → z <=4.758. But that's the upper limit. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Hmm. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. The absorption line must be in the optical for the telescope to see it. So the observed wavelength must be between, say, 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) and 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So 4000 <= lambda_obs <=7000 Angstroms.

But lambda_obs = 1216*(1+z). So to find the minimum redshift, we need the minimum z such that lambda_obs is within the optical.

Wait, but if the cloud has a lower redshift, then lambda_obs would be shorter. Oh wait, no. Lower redshift (z is small) would mean lambda_obs is closer to 1216, which is in the UV. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, we need lambda_obs >=4000 Angstroms.

Wait, because 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is violet. So if the observed wavelength is at least 4000 Angstroms, then the line is in the optical. So let's set 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

So solve for z:

1 + z >= 4000 / 1216 ≈3.29

So z >= 2.29.

Looking at the options, the options given are:

A) 3

B) 1.2

C) 2.4

D) 1.9.

So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. Wait, 2.29 is just above 2.29, which is between 1.9 and 2.4. So the lower limit would be about 2.29, so the minimum redshift z is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit on z is 2.29, so any z >= 2.29 would make the absorption line in the optical.

Looking at the options, the only option higher than 2.29 is option C) 2.4 and option A)3. So the lower limit is the minimum z, so 2.29. So the options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. Wait, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So if the lower limit is about 2.29, then any z above that is acceptable. So the question is asking for the lower limit, meaning the minimum z required. So the minimum z is about 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. So the options given are 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D). Wait, 2.3 is between 2.4 and 1.9? No, 2.3 is between 1.9 and 2.4. So if the minimum is 2.3, then any z higher than that (like 2.4) would be acceptable. But the question says "lower limit on the redshift", which I think refers to the minimum z such that the line is observable. So the minimum z is 2.29, so the lower limit is just above that. So if the options have 2.4 as an option, that would be the lower limit, as any z above that would be acceptable. But wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected." So the lower limit would be the smallest z where they can be detected. Wait, no, the lower limit is the minimum z, but higher z would make it easier or possible. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If the redshift is too low (z is small), then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) which is close to 1216, which is in the UV. Optical telescopes can't see UV, so the line would not be detected. As z increases, the observed wavelength moves into the optical. So the minimal z where the line enters the optical is when 1216*(1+z) =4000 Angstroms (400 nm). Because any higher z would shift it to longer wavelengths (still in the optical), which the telescope can see.

So solving 1216*(1+z) =4000 → 1+z =4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is just above that. So the objects must have a redshift above approximately 2.29 to be detected. So the options give us 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D). Since 2.29 is between 2 and 2.4, the lower limit would be when z is around 2.3. So the options that are equal to or higher than 2.3 are acceptable. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.3. The options don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4, which is the next higher option. So that would be the answer. But wait, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so it's not acceptable.

Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z that allows detection is about 2.29. So any z >=2.29 would be detectable. So the lower limit is 2.29. The question is asking for an estimate, so perhaps the options are rounded.

So the options are:

A)3 → z=3. So 1216*(4) =4864 Angstroms, which is 486.4 nm, visible green. So that's in optical.

C)2.4 →1216*3.4≈4134 Angstroms (413 nm), which is violet/blue, in the optical.

D)1.9 →1216 * 2.9≈3526.4 Angstroms →352.6 nm, which is UV (since UV is about 10-400 nm). So 352 nm is in the UV, which can't be detected by optical telescopes.

So the minimal z is 2.29. So the minimal is about 2.3. So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.3. So the options that are equal or higher than 2.3 are C (2.4) and A (3). Since the question is about the lower limit, it's the minimal z, so 2.3. So the options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. Since 2.3 is closer to 2.4, but the options don't have 2.3, so the correct answer is C)2.4.

Wait, but wait the options are all given as possible estimates. So the question says "estimate the lower limit", so perhaps the correct minimal z is when the observed wavelength is 400 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1+z)=4000 → z= (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.29-1=2.29. So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So looking at the options, the only one that is higher than this is C)2.4 and A)3. So the minimal is 2.29, but the options don't have that, so the next higher option would be 2.4, which is option C. So the answer should be C.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) such that large clouds of neutral hydrogen can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshifted Lyman alpha absorption line. The rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \), and optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \) to \( 7000 \, \text{Å} \). The observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å}.
\]

To find the lower limit on \( z \), we consider the minimum wavelength in the optical range, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \). Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29.
\]

Thus:

\[
z \geq 3.29 - 1 = 2.29.
\]

This means the minimum redshift required for the Lyman alpha absorption line to fall within the optical range is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: \( z = 3 \) corresponds to \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot 4 = 4864 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the optical range.
- **B) 1.2**: \( z = 1.2 \) corresponds to \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot 2.2 = 2675 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: \( z = 2.4 \) corresponds to \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot 3.4 = 4134 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the optical range.
- **D) 1.9**: \( z = 1.9 \) corresponds to \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot 2.9 = 3526 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.

The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). Among the options, the smallest value greater than or equal to \( 2.29 \) is \( z = 2.4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
