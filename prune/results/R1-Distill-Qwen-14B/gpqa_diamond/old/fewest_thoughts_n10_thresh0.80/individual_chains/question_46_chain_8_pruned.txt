Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. So Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal complex, typically used for alkene metathesis, like breaking and recombining alkenes.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Oh wait, wait: wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a 3-methyl substitution, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let's count the carbons. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So yes, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait no, that's not possible because that would make the chain longer than five carbons. Wait, wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, pent means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? No, that's six carbons. Oh wait, maybe I got the structure wrong.

Wait, pentene is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: CH2=, Carbon 2: CH-, Carbon 3: CH(CH3), then maybe it's CH2-CH2? Wait, perhaps I should number the carbons correctly.

Wait, let's write it. Position 1 is the first carbon, with a double bond. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons in total. Yes, because 1,2,3,4,5.

So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH
