Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup: An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So first, I should probably recall what happens when an electron and positron annihilate. I think they produce gamma rays, but in this case, two photons are produced. Since they have the same energy, that might mean they have the same frequency and wavelength, but opposite in some way.

Wait, but why are the photons moving in upper-right and lower-right directions? Because the collision might result in some angular distribution, but I'm not sure. I remember that in annihilation, the total momentum must be conserved. Also, energy conservation applies.

Let me think about the initial momenta. The electron and positron are moving towards each other. Since a positron is the antimatter counterpart of an electron, they have the same mass. So, the electron has a Lorentz factor (γ) of 4, and the positron has γ of 2.

Wait, Lorentz factor is γ = E/(m c²), but for momentum, p = γ m v. Alternatively, since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v = (sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)) c. Hmm. Maybe I should compute their momenta.

Let me denote the electron as particle 1 and the positron as particle 2. The electron moves to the right, and the positron moves to the left? Wait no, the problem says the positron is moving from the right. So, the electron is moving from the left to the right along the horizontal axis. The positron is moving from the right to the left along the same axis.

Wait, no: the question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, the positron is moving to the left. The electron is moving to the right.

So, their momenta are in opposite directions. So, the initial total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

Let me compute their momenta. For each, p = γ m v. But since v can be expressed in terms of γ, perhaps it's easier to use the relation p = γ m v = (γ m c) * (v/c). And from γ = 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2), which can be rearranged to (v/c) = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So for the electron (γ=4):

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c.

So, the momentum of the electron is p_e = γ m_e v_e.

Similarly for the positron (γ=2):

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4
