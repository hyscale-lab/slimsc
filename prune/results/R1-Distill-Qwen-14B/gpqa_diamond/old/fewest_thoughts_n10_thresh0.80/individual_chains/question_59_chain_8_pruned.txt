Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and pH calculations can get tricky. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I think I should figure out how much acid and base are present in each solution and see what happens when they react.

Let me list out each solution and calculate the moles of H+ and OH- they contribute.

Starting with CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. I think I can consider it as a source of H+ ions. The formula for acetic acid is CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H+. But wait, since it's a weak acid, maybe I need to account for its dissociation. Hmm, but wait, maybe not immediately. Because when we mix all these solutions, the strong acids and bases will react first, and any weak acid might come into play afterward. Or perhaps we should account for all H+ and OH- sources first.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total moles of H+ from all sources and total moles of OH- from all sources. Then see if there's an excess of H+ or OH- after neutralization. If there's an excess, the pH will depend on that. If they're equal, the solution is neutral, pH 7.

So, let's compute each solution's contribution.

First solution: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it will contribute some H+ ions. But let's hold on that and see the other components.

Second solution: 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates into H+ and Cl-. So moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Each HCl gives one H+, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Third solution: 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^- ions, so moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they react. The H+ from acids will react with OH- from bases to form water.

So the total H+ from all sources (excluding the weak acid, maybe) is from HCl and the acetic acid. Wait, but wait, the H+ from CH3COOH is weak, so maybe it's better to treat it after the strong acid-base reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first consider all the H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) and all the OH- (from Ba(OH)2) and see how they react.

But wait, the acetic acid is a weak acid, which contributes H+ but not as much as a strong acid. Hmm, but when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, they can react. So perhaps I should first calculate the moles of H+ and
