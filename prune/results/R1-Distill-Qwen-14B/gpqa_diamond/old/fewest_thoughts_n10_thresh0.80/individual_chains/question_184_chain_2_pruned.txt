Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

Hmm, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are numbered such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, wait, I think I should double-check the numbering. In benzene rings, the numbering is done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me visualize the structure: position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. That forms a meta arrangement for nitro and ethoxy? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering can be tricky. Let me think: if position 1 is ethoxy, then position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, with substituents in the ortho and meta positions relative to each other.

Now, the key is to figure out the order of introducing these substituents. Since substituents can direct incoming groups to specific positions, the order in which they are introduced will affect the product.

Let's recall the directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy groups are ortho/para directors because they are activating (since OCH2CH3 is an activating group, being an ether). Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Ethoxy is an activating group? No, wait, ethers like OCH2CH3 are activating because the lone pairs on O can donate electrons through resonance. So they
