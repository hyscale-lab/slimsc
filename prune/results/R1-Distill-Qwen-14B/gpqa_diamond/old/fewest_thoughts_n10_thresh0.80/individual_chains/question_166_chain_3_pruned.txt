Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The Lagrangian is given, and there are some fields involved. The fermions N_i R are singlets, so they don't interact with the gauge fields except maybe through other terms. The scalar S is a doublet, so that's like the Higgs doublet maybe? And phi is a singlet scalar. 

The Lagrangian has terms like i bar(N_R) gamma^mu partial_mu N_R. That looks like a kinetic term for the singlet fermions. Then there's the (partial phi)^2 term, which is the standard kinetic term for a scalar. The |D^mu S|^2 term is the gauge kinetic term for the scalar doublet S, so that's similar to the Higgs field's kinetic term in the Standard Model.

The term with y_i /2 phi bar(N_iR)^c N_iR^c is a Yukawa-like term, coupling the singlet scalar phi to the right-handed neutrinos. Then there's another term with g_{iα} bar(N_iR) L_alpha S. L_alpha is probably the lepton doublet, so this term must be some kind of coupling between the singlet neutrinos and the charged leptons via the scalar S. 

The potential V(phi, S, H) is there, but we're not told much about it. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given: ⟨phi⟩² = x² + v², where ⟨phi⟩ is x and ⟨h⟩ is v. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, the question says ⟨phi⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. But in the given Lagrangian, I don't see an h field. Hmm, perhaps S is the Higgs that gets a VEV? Or maybe phi and S are involved in generating the VEVs. 

Wait the Standard Model Higgs is a doublet, usually, so perhaps S is the Higgs doublet here. So S would get a VEV, and phi is another scalar. Hmm, but the VEVs given are for phi and h, which is part of S perhaps?

Wait, the question says ⟨phi⟩ is x and ⟨h⟩ is v. So maybe S is the Higgs that gives mass to the W and Z bosons. So S would have a VEV, say, in the (charge +1/2 component) direction, leading to the masses for the W and Z. Then phi is another scalar. But in the given setup, phi is a singlet, so it doesn't mix with the Higgs doublet. But in the potential, V(phi, S, H), perhaps H is another scalar. Hmm, maybe the model has multiple scalar fields: S (doublet), phi (singlet), and another scalar H? Or maybe H is another component of S? I
