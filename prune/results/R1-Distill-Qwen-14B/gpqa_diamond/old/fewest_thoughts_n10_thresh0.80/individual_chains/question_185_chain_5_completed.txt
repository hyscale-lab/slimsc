Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step. 

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each of which is a 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, the dot product σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, right? And n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. 

Since H is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvalues should be the solutions to the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way to do this without getting into matrices. 

I remember that the Pauli matrices have some properties. Each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. Oh wait, or is it that their trace is zero and determinant is -1? Let me think. For σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because when you square them, you get the identity matrix. So σ_i^2 = I. 

So H is a linear combination of these Pauli matrices. Let me see, the eigenvalues of H would depend on the magnitude of the combination. Wait, since the Pauli matrices are being multiplied by n_x, n_y, n_z, which sum up as a vector of unit length, the entire combination σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1? Because each σ_i does, and they are being combined linearly.

But wait, no. Because the coefficients here are n_x, n_y, n_z, and n is a unit vector. So the operator σ · n is a matrix where each component is scaled by the corresponding component of n. So for any direction n, σ · n would have eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because the magnitude of σ · n is 1, because each Pauli matrix is traceless and has determinant -1, but when you have it as a sum in any direction, its eigenvalues are ±1. 

Wait, wait. Let me think about the general case. The operator σ · n is a traceless matrix with magnitude 1, right? Because when you compute (σ · n)^2, it's equal to (n · σ)(n · σ) = n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. And since σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k (the anticommutation relation). So when you sum over i and j, (n · σ)^2 = n_i n_j (δ_ij I) + ... wait, the cross terms would involve the epsilon and sigma matrices, but when you take the trace, those cross terms would have trace zero. So the square is equal to (n · σ)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = (1) I = I, because n is a unit vector. So (σ · n)^2 = I. 

So the eigenvalues of H must satisfy λ^2 = ε^2 * (eigenvalues of (σ · n)^2). Wait, no, because H is ε multiplied by σ · n. So H = ε (σ · n). Then H^2 = ε² (σ · n)^2 = ε² I. 

So the eigenvalues λ must satisfy λ² = ε². Therefore, λ = ± ε. 

So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. Looking at the options, option B says +ε and -ε. So the correct answer should be option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of \(H\).

The Pauli matrices \(\vec{\sigma}\) have the property that \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a traceless matrix with eigenvalues \(\pm 1\), regardless of the direction of \(\vec{n}\), because \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. This follows from the fact that \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\).

Since \(H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) are scaled by \(\varepsilon\). Thus, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

To confirm, we can also compute \(H^2 = \varepsilon^2 (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \varepsilon^2 I\). This implies that the eigenvalues of \(H\) satisfy \(\lambda^2 = \varepsilon^2\), leading to \(\lambda = \pm \varepsilon\).

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** \(+1, -1\) — Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).  
**B)** \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) — Correct, matches the derived eigenvalues.  
**C)** \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) — Incorrect, introduces an unnecessary factor of \(\hbar/2\).  
**D)** \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) — Incorrect, does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).

Answer: B
