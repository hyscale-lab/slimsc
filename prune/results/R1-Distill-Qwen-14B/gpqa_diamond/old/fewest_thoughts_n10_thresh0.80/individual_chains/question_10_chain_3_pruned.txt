Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, the question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. Since planets are roughly spherical, their volume can be calculated using the formula (4/3)πr³. So, the volume depends on the radius, but it's not linear—it's cubic. So, a planet with a larger radius doesn't scale the volume as simply as mass does.

Looking at the options:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, this planet has the same mass and radius as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this one would have that density.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, no, wait. The option says the planet's density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, the question is about which has the highest density. If this planet already has a density of 5.5, same as Earth, then comparing it to others.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Wait, same composition as Earth. So, Earth's composition determines its density. If the planet is more massive but same composition, does that mean the density remains the same? Because density is mass/volume, but if mass increases and volume increases proportionally (same composition, so same density), then density remains same as Earth.

Wait, no. Wait, if the planet is more massive but same composition, perhaps it's larger in radius as well. So, same density as Earth because density is composition-dependent. Because if you have the same composition, adding more mass would require a larger radius, but the density (mass/volume) would stay the same.

So, for option c), the density would be same as Earth.

Option d) Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So, same reasoning as c. Its density would be same as Earth.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If a planet has the same composition as Earth, then its density should be the same because density is determined by what it's made of. So, if you have a larger or smaller version of Earth, as long as the composition is same, the density remains same.
