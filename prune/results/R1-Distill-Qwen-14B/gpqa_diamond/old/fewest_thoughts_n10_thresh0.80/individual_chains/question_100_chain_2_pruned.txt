Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, that formula rings a bell. C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane, right? Wait, no, cyclopropane would have a formula of C3H6 as well. But wait, more commonly, C3H6 is propene, which is an alkene. Oh wait, actually, the formula for propene is C3H6 because each double bond reduces two hydrogens. So propene, or maybe cyclopropane. But given the reactions, maybe it's propene. Because the first reaction is bromination in the presence of CCl4. That sounds like addition reaction for alkenes. So if A is propene, then...

So, Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4. I remember that when an alkene reacts with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, it's a dibromination addition. So for propene, CH2=CH2CH3, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So that's Compound B.

Wait, wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 across the double bond would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Oh wait, no, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it would add across the two carbons in the double bond. So it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's an elimination reaction. So, dehydrohalogenation. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then treating with alcoholic KOH would cause elimination. Since there are two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would form an alkene again. But wait, the structureâ€”so the starting material is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When eliminating both Brs, would the double bond form between the first and
