Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully and think through what's going on.

The question says that a chemist does two reactions, Reaction I and II. Then they combine the products and run them on two different HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. We need to find out how many peaks each will show.

Let me start by looking at each reaction separately.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

Wait, LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure would be:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-... Let me draw it properly.

Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So, the structure is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, hexane is six carbons, so carbon 3 is the third. So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, maybe I should number from the other end. Oh wait, 5-methoxy is on carbon 5. So, hexan-3-one is:

O
||
C on carbon 3.

So, structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, more accurately, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a methoxy on the 5th carbon.

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Hexane has six carbons. 3-one means the ketone is on C3. So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3.

But wait, wait, that would make it 3-pentanone if it's five carbons. No, hexan would be six. So, 3-hexanone is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me write it as CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Is that right? Because that would be hexan-3-one: the ketone is on carbon 3.

But the compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, on carbon 5, there's an OCH3 group. So, the
