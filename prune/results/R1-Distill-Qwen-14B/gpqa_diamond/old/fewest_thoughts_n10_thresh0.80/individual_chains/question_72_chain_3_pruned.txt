Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question involves several reactions leading to a product, and then determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7. So, I need to figure out what each reaction does and what the structure of the final product looks like.

First, let me break down the reactions:

1. 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

2. Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming product 2.

3. Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3.

4. Product 3 is heated at 150°C, forming final product 4.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct (equivalent) hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Let me tackle each step one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, the bicyclo structure is norbornene, and it's substituted with a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, norbornene has two double bonds, but wait—bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds? Wait, no, the numbering is 2 and 5, but the structure of norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, which is a single double bond. Wait, no, I think the diene in the name suggests two double bonds. So, perhaps the bicyclo compound is a diene, meaning it has two double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-ene called diene because of the positions? Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps it's a molecule with two double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclo structure with double bonds in the 2 and 5 positions.

Anyway, the substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. Now, the other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, that's a cyclohexadiene (two double bonds at 1 and 3 positions) with substituents on carbons 5 and 6. Each of those substituents is a dibromomethyl group. So, each of those carbons has a CH2Br2 group attached.

The reaction is done with 2 equivalents of this dibromomethyl compound, along with sodium iodide and elevated temperature. So, given the reagents, this seems like a nucleophilic substitution reaction, possibly an SN2. But wait, sodium iodide (NaI) is present, which usually provides I- as a good leaving group. Wait, but
