Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Okay, I remember that FTIR is good for detecting functional groups, and NMR helps in determining the structure and environment of protons.

The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Wait, broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Because a broad peak around 3000 typically comes from hydrogen bonding, which is common in -OH groups. So, the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group. That makes sense because carboxylic acids have strong O-H bonds that absorb in that region and are broad due to hydrogen bonding.

Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. I recall that carbonyl groups (like C=O) have strong absorption around 1700. The exact wavenumber can vary based on the group. Carboxylic acids have a C=O stretch around 1700, so that fits with the previous observation. So, the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, they mentioned that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means double bond hydrogens, like in alkenes. So this compound doesn't have any double bonds, or if it does, the protons aren't showing up as vinyl. That probably rules out any compounds with double bonds. Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check if any have double bonds. The options given are all with branching, but I don't see any double bonds in the structures. So that's okay; all of them are saturated, so no vinyl protons, which explains why they aren't seen.

Now, the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Splitting (multiplying of peaks) occurs due to coupling with neighboring protons. The more neighboring Hs, the more splits. So, for example, a quartet is from coupling with three equivalent protons. A triplet would be coupling with two, and a doublet with one.

So if a signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, that's a complex splitting. Let's break it down. Maybe each level of splitting comes from different neighboring groups. Let's imagine each step:

First, a quartet suggests a group with three adjacent Hs. Then, that quartet is split into a triplet, which would be coupling with two Hs. Then, that triplet is further split into a doublet, which would be coupling with one H. So the splitting pattern is (quartet) → triplet → doublet. Similarly, the other signal is (quartet) → triplet → triplet. So each step is a different coupling.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting
