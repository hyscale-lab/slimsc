Okay, so I've got this question about non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a state |psi> which is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, scaled by a normalization constant N. The state is written as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). Oh wait, right, when you have superpositions like this, especially with coherent states, the normalization can get tricky because of the overlaps between |alpha> and |-alpha>. 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So first, I need to plug these values into the expression for N. Let me calculate sin(2phi) and exp(-2alpha²) first.

Sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4: 2phi is -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1.

Exp(-2alpha²) with alpha=0.5: 2*(0.5)^2=0.5. e^(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So exp(-2alpha²) is about 0.6065.

So the term inside the square root for N is 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935). Let me compute that: sqrt(0.3935) is approximately 0.6275.

Wait, but wait, N is the normalization, so |psi> must have a norm of 1. Let me check: |cos(phi)|² is cos²(pi/4), since phi is -pi/4 but squared. Cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, so cos² is 0.5. Similarly, |sin(phi)|² is also 0.5. But when you have the cross terms in the normalization, like the inner product between |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is exp(-2|alpha|²) because coherent states have an inner product exp(-|alpha|^2 - |beta|^2 + 2 Re(alpha beta^*)) or something like that. Wait, for |alpha> and |-alpha>, the inner product would be exp(-|alpha|² - |-alpha|² + 2 Re(alpha (-alpha)* )) = exp(-2|alpha|² + 2 Re(-|alpha|² )) Hmm, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I think the inner product between |alpha> and |-alpha> is e^{-2|alpha|^2} because the coherent states' overlap is e^{-|alpha - beta|^2/2} but since beta is -alpha, then |alpha - (-alpha)|^2 is (2 alpha)^2, so the exponent is - ( (2 alpha)^2 ) / 2 = - 2 alpha². So the inner product is e^{-2 alpha²}.

So when computing N, the normalization comes from the square of the sum. So |psi> is (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N. So when you compute <psi|psi>, you get (cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) Re[<alpha| -alpha>]) / N^2.

Wait, but that's perhaps getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, the normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh because in the problem statement, N is provided, so perhaps that's how it's derived. So I don't have to compute it from scratch but just plug in the values.

But in any case, for the given phi and alpha, we can compute N. So phi is -pi/4. Let's compute 2 phi: 2*(-pi/4) =
