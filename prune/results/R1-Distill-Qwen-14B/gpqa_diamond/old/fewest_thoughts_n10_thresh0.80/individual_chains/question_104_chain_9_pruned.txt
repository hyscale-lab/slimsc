Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, or something like that.

The question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. The planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit. They're using the RV method, so the key here is the periodic shift in the spectral lines.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but I think the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbit's characteristics.

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since the planets are in circular orbits, e is zero, so that simplifies the denominator. Also, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to something like K proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me get the exact formula. I think the correct formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And sin i is 1 because the orbits are edge-on, which is the case for RV detection (otherwise we wouldn't see the shift). Also, e=0 because the orbits are circular. So the formula reduces to:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of how K relates to the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, perhaps the ratio of K can tell us about the ratio of periods.

Wait, but K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity. So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Because, from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3)
