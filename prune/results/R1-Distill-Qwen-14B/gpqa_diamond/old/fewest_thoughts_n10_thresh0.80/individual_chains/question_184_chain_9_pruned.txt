Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene using a series of reactions. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering... I think in the target, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me sketch it out mentally. Position 1: ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH2CH3)3?), and position 3: nitro group (NO2). Wait, no, tert-butyl is (CH2CH3)3C-, right? Or wait, no. Wait, tert-butyl is actually (CH3)3C-; because the t in tert-butyl refers to three methyl groups attached to a central carbon. So, (CH3)3C-.

So the substituents are on the benzene ring at 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, but in benzene, the numbering is such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So I should arrange their positions correctly. Let me imagine the benzene ring as:

Position 1: ethoxy group (ethoxy is OCH2CH3).
Position 2: tert-butyl group.
Position 3: nitro group.

Wait, but the numbering could vary. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), or another arrangement. But the main thing is that all three substituents are present on the benzene ring in the correct order.

Now, the starting material is benzene. We need to perform several reactions to add the substituents in the correct positions. Let's think about the possible reactions and their order.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the order in which substituents are introduced can affect the positions where subsequent groups add. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing effects of the existing substituents.

So, benzene is our starting point. Let's consider each substituent and the order of addition.

First, let's think about the substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

Ethoxy group is an activating group (ortho/para director) because it's an electron-donating group. Nitro is a deactivating group (meta director) because it's electron-withdrawing. The tert-butyl group is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group; electron-donating via induction, not resonance) and thus is an ortho/para director.

But wait, the tert-butyl group is a strong activating group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, alkyl groups are activating, right? Because they donate electrons through sigma bonds. So when you have a benzene ring with an activating group, the next substituent will enter in ortho or para positions relative to it.

But wait, if we're introducing substituents in a certain order, each step's directing effect will influence where the next substituent goes.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me think about how these could be introduced.

Wait, but the target has two nitro groups? No, wait, no. Let me check again. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So it's only one nitro group, one ethoxy, and one tert-butyl.

Wait, but wait: the numbering. Let me make sure. Let me imagine benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.

So the substituents are: 

1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3)

2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3)

3: nitro (NO2)

Wait, but in a benzene ring, the positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, so the substituents are in the ortho positions to each other. That's possible, but the directing effects have to be considered.

But wait, when introducing substituents, each new group will be directed by the existing groups. So the order of adding substituents is critical.

Let me think about the possible steps.

If we start by adding a tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, that's an alkylating agent. Alkylation with tert
