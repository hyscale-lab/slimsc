Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant tells us about the renormalizability. If the dimension is positive, it's more likely to make the theory non-renormalizable. Or was it the other way around?

First, I should figure out the mass dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Because the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions, right? Because when you integrate the Lagrangian density over spacetime, the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have [L] = 4.

The term given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break it down.

Each field has certain mass dimensions. Fermion fields ψ have dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the spinor field has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2.

What about the field strength tensor F^{μν}? F is the field strength for, say, electromagnetism, I think. And F is derived from the gauge field A, which has dimension 1. The field strength is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative adds dimension 1. So F has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is an antisymmetric tensor made from gamma matrices. The structure is (i/2)[γμ, γν], but the exact form doesn't affect the mass dimension. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, I think, because they're just matrices. So σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. Because the commutator of two dimensionless objects is dimensionless, multiplied by i/2 which is a constant.

So putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F.

So [L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F].

Since [σ] is 0, [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, [F] is 2.

Adding those up: [κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + 2.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each of those four fields: ψ̄, σ, ψ, F.

Wait, no: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So together, 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5.

So [L_int] = [κ] + 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so [κ] +5 =4 ⇒ [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, to check if the theory is renormalizable. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤4 in 4D spacetime. Wait, wait, no. Wait, more precisely, in four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension ≤4− the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram is calculated as D = d + (L) * (d-4), where d is the spacetime dimension (4 here) and L is the number of loops. But another approach is to look at the mass dimensions of the coupling constants.

Wait, another way: in four dimensions, a coupling constant is renormalizable if its dimension is ≤ 4 − [field terms]. Wait, perhaps more accurately, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 (since the action is dimensionless, and you integrate over four dimensions). But for renormalizability, each term must have dimension ≤4.

Wait, no. Wait, for a term in the Lagrangian, each term must have [Lagrangian term] = 4. But for a theory to be renormalizable, all the couplings must have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has negative dimension, then the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (UV), leading to a non-renormalizable theory.

Wait, more accurately, in 4D, a coupling constant with dimension [κ] > 0 would imply non-renormalizable. Because coupling constants with positive mass dimension would require counterterms with higher momentum dependence, leading to infinitely many counterterms. So, to be renormalizable, all couplings must have [κ] ≤ 0? Or is it that their dimension must be ≥ (4 - [fields])?

Wait, I think the rule is that in 4D, a coupling constant is renormalizable if its mass dimension is ≥ 0. Or wait, perhaps the way to think is to find the mass dimension of the coupling and see whether it is non-negative.

Wait, the formula for the mass dimension of a coupling is given by [g] = D - (sum of field dimensions in the term).

Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for the term g φ^n, the dimension is [g] + n*[φ] =4.

So [g] =4 -n*[φ].

In 4D, the scalar field [φ] is 1. So for a φ^4 term, [g] =4 -4*1=0. Which is renormalizable.

If [g] is positive, then the term has higher dimension, which suggests that the coupling becomes relevant in the IR, but maybe that's not the key here.

Wait, but for renormalizability, the coupling must have mass dimension ≥0. Because if the coupling has negative dimension, then the interaction term has higher dimension, which isn't allowed in a renormalizable theory.

Wait, wait. Wait, the condition is that the dimension of the coupling must satisfy [g] ≥ (d/2 - n), where n is the number of fields. Or perhaps no, that's for the superficial degree of divergence.

I think the correct approach is: in four dimensions, a coupling is renormalizable if its mass dimension is ≥0. Because if [g] is negative, the term in the Lagrangian has higher dimension (since [g] + sum of field dimensions =4). But if [g] is negative, that would imply the term is of higher dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The mass dimension of the coupling [g] must be ≥ (4 - sum of the field dimensions). Because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So for each term g φ_1 φ_2 ... φ_n, [g] =4 - sum [φ_i].

If [g] is positive, that's okay. If [g] is negative, the term is higher-dimensional, which would make it non-renormalizable.

So for our problem, [κ] is -1, which is less than zero. So the interaction term has dimension 4, but the coupling has negative mass dimension. Hence, this term is of higher dimension, which makes the theory non-renormalizable. Because such couplings would require introducing an infinite number of counterterms, as you go to higher energies.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4, but the coupling itself has negative dimension. So when you write down Feynman diagrams, each vertex would bring a factor of κ, which has dimension -1. So each vertex contributes a factor that scales as E^-1 (assuming momenta E), making the amplitude less likely to diverge, but actually, perhaps making the theory less predictive because you need infinitely many terms.

So the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together: the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable.

Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory is renormalizable. So that's incorrect.

So the answer should be C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The fermion fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have mass dimension $3/2$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, has mass dimension $2$.
- The antisymmetric tensor $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$, constructed from the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$ and $\gamma_\nu$, is dimensionless (mass dimension $0$).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in four spacetime dimensions. The term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ is:
\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}.
\]
The mass dimension of this term is:
\[
[\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] = [\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}].
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
4 = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
4 = [\kappa] + 4 \implies [\kappa] = 0 - 0 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, which makes them less predictive at high energies.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) The mass dimension $[\kappa]_M = -1$. The theory is not renormalizable.**
