Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully and try to break it down.

The problem talks about two mixtures, X and Y, and a substance Z. Let me jot down the key points:

1. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, these must be compounds that can react with bromine, probably alkenes or something with double bonds. Because alkenes can decolorize bromine water via addition reactions.

2. When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. Importantly, Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since X's components can add bromine, but Y's can't, maybe X's components are undergoing some kind of reduction or a reaction that removes the functional groups that react with bromine. Disproportionation is mentioned, so probably a reaction where one molecule is both oxidized and reduced. Like maybe a diene splitting into an alkane and something else with a functional group that doesn't react.

3. Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. So, both mixtures X and Y, when hydrogenated, produce the same product Z. That suggests that the components of X and Y are such that their hydrogenation leads to the same compound. Since Z is a hydrocarbon, it's likely that the starting materials are alkenes or perhaps alkynes, but since alkenes are more common for hydrogenation.

4. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let me calculate that. The mass of H is 14.28%, so the rest is carbon. So, mass of H is 14.28%, C is 85.72%. Let's find the molecular formula.

5. The molecular formula of Z: Let's assume it's CnHm. The molar mass would be (12n + m). The mass fraction of H is (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) = 0.1428.

Hmm, 0.1428 is approximately 1/7. So, m/(12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n. So, for every carbon, two hydrogens. Wait, but that would make a formula like CnH2n. Wait, but that's the formula for an alkene or alkyne, but Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen. Oh right, because if it's fully hydrogenated, maybe it's an alkane.

Wait, but wait, if m=2n, that's like ethylene (C2H4), but that's an alkene. But if Z is an alkane, the formula would be CnH2n+2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my assumption.

Wait, let's compute it again. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So,

mass of H: 14.28% = 1/7.

So, (m) / (12n + m) ) = 1/7 → 7m =12n + m → 6m=12n → m=2n.

So, the molecular formula is CnH2n. That would imply a molecule like an alkene. But wait, Z is a hydrocarbon and doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, maybe it's an alkane. But wait, if it's an alkane, then the formula would be CnH2n+2. Let me check that.

If Z is an alkane, then the H percentage would be (2n+2)/(12n + 2n + 2) ) * 100. Let's plug in n=1: 4/(14) ~28.57%. n=2: 6/(24+6)=6/30=20%. n=3: 8/(36+8)=8/44≈18.18%. n=4: 1
