Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question says that a colleague has a new quantum field theory and is working on regularizing higher-order loop diagrams. There's a scribbled note with a Feynman diagram and some terms next to it. The terms are: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. The task is to determine how many loops the diagram had.

Hmm, I remember that Feynman diagrams and loop integrals are related to the order in perturbation theory. Each loop typically contributes a certain factor to the amplitude, and the number of loops is tied to the order of the expansion. So, the number of loops corresponds to the loop order, which is the number of powers of the coupling constants and other terms.

Wait, but how do I get from the given expression to the number of loops? Let's think about the structure of loop integrals. Each loop integral in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (4π)^{d/2}, where d is the spacetime dimension. Since this is four-dimensional spacetime (as mentioned in the question), d=4, so each loop would give a (4π)^2 factor. But wait, in the given expression, there's a (4pi)^6 in the denominator. So let's see: 1/(4pi)^6 is (1/(4pi)^2)^3. So that would imply three loops, each contributing (4pi)^2. So three loops would have (4pi)^6 in the numerator, but here it's in the denominator as 1/(4pi)^6. So maybe each loop brings a (4pi)^2 factor in the denominator? Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The loop integrals in four dimensions typically involve integrals over d^4k, which after some manipulations (like Wick rotation) turn into integrals over d^4k_E, which are then evaluated in terms of Gamma functions and factors of (4π). For each loop, the integral contributes a factor of (4π)^2 times some other terms like the mass scale raised to some power.

So, for example, a one-loop integral might look like ∫ d^4k/(k^2 - m^2 + iε), which after evaluation gives something proportional to (4π)^2 times a logarithm or something. So each loop adds a (4π)^2 factor.

But in the given expression, the term is 1/(4π)^6. So 1/(4π)^6 could come from three loops, each contributing a (4π)^2 in the denominator? Or maybe each loop contributes a (4π)^2 in the numerator, and then in the overall amplitude, it's in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall scaling. Let me try to recall the general form of loop integrals. For a Feynman diagram with L loops, the integral typically has a factor of (4π)^{L} / (something), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. Alternatively, the loop integrals contribute factors like (μ^2
