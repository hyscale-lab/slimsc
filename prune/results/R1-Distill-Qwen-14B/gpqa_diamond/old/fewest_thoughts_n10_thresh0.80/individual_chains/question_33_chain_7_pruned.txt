Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because cycloaddition reactions can be a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione under heat. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. Oh wait, wait. Wait, wait. No, wait. Diels-Alder is a specific type of [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. So in this case, I need to figure out which of the two molecules is the diene and which is the dienophile.

So 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a thiophene ring with methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is an aromatic heterocyclic compound. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups at the 2 and 5 positions of a furan ring. Furan is a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions, right? So maybe the diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene.

Wait, but wait a second. Thiophene is an aromatic compound, and for a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene needs to be conjugated and non-aromatic. Oh wait, thiophene itself isn't a diene. Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, in Diels-Alder, the diene is conjugated and can undergo the reaction in a s-cis conformation. So 2,5-dimethylthiophene has a conjugated system. Let's count the double bonds. Thiophene has a five-membered ring with two double bonds (positions 1-2, 3-4, and 4-5 with a single bond). Wait, actually, thiophene has two double bonds, so it's a conjugated systemâ€”could it act as a diene or dienophile?

Wait, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Alternatively, perhaps one of the reactants is a dienophile and the other is the diene. Furan-2,5-dione has electron
