Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about oxygen acting as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. It asks about thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. Hmm, I remember that thermodynamics has to do with whether a reaction is favorable (like the position of the equilibrium), while kinetics is about how fast the reaction happens.

The statement says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. And then there are options about weaker/stronger and faster/slower.

Wait, I think in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to the standard electrode potential. A stronger oxidant has a higher reduction potential. So, in basic solutions, what's the standard potential for O2?

I remember that in acidic conditions, the O2 reduction is something like O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, which has a standard E° of around +1.23 V. But in basic conditions, the same reaction would adjust because OH- is present. So the reaction would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- with an E° of around +0.40 V. So in basic solution, the E° is lower than in acidic. Lower E° means it's a weaker oxidant? Because the driving force is less. So thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. So the first blank should be 'weaker'.

Now the kinetic part: how fast does O2 react in acidic versus basic. Kinetics is about reaction rates. From what I recall, the rate of an electrochemical reaction depends on the concentration of ions involved. In acidic solutions, H+ ions are abundant. The O2 reduction reaction in acidic conditions has H+ in it, so their high concentration could make the reaction faster.

Wait, but isn't the reaction rate also influenced by the overpotential? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh right, overpotential is the difference between the theoretical electrode potential and the actual potential needed for the reaction to occur. It's higher for reactions like O2 evolution or reduction because of mass transport issues or other factors.

In acidic conditions, maybe the reaction is faster because H+ is present in higher concentration, which facilitates the reaction. Or wait, in basic conditions, OH- is present. The reaction in basic conditions requires OH- (as in O2 + 2H2O +4e- → 4OH-). So in basic solution, the OH- is available, which is part of the reaction. But wait, in acidic solution, the H+ is higher, making it easier for the reaction to proceed because the protons are more available.

Wait, but when considering kinetics, maybe the reaction is faster in the solution where the reaction conditions are more favorable. For the O2 reduction, in acidic solution, the H+ helps in the reaction. So if the reaction is in acidic solution, it's more favorable kinetically, meaning it proceeds faster.

Wait no, let me think again. The reaction in acidic solution is O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O. The availability of H+ would mean that the reaction can proceed more quickly because the required ions are present in higher concentration. So in acidic solutions, the reaction would be faster.

So putting it together: Thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions (so first part is 'weaker'), and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions (so second part is 'faster').

Looking at the options, the first part is weaker, the second is faster. Let's see the options:

Option C) weaker - faster
Option A) stronger - faster → no, first part is correct, second not.
Option B) stronger - slower → first wrong.
Option D) weaker - slower → second wrong.

So the correct combination is weaker and faster. That's option C.


Thermodynamically, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard electrode potential. In acidic solutions, the reduction potential of oxygen ($O_2$) is higher (+1.23 V) compared to its potential in basic solutions (+0.40 V). This lower potential in basic solutions indicates that oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic environments.

Kinetically, the reaction rate depends on the availability of ions involved in the reaction. In acidic solutions, the reduction of oxygen involves $H^+$ ions, which are present in higher concentrations, facilitating a faster reaction. In contrast, in basic solutions, the reaction involves $OH^-$ ions, which may not be as readily available, leading to a slower reaction. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations, oxygen is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions and reacts faster kinetically in acidic solutions. The correct option is:

Answer: C
