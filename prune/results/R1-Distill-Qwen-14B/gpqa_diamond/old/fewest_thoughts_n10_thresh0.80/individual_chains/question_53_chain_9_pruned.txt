Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals: two for aromatic-H, two for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for –CH3 groups. There are no signals for –CH2 groups. So I need to figure out the chemical formula from the options given.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, meaning there are two substituents attached to the benzene. The IR shows an ester group, so the substituents might be ester groups or perhaps one is an ester and the other is something else. But wait, the problem says it's a di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring.

The NMR data is more telling. Let's consider the NMR signals:

1. Two aromatic protons. That suggests that the substituents are such that there are only two distinct types of aromatic protons. For a di-substituted benzene, symmetrical substitution can lead to fewer signals. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, you might get two sets of aromatic protons. Wait, no, if they are para, you might have equivalent protons. Let me think: in para substitution, the ring has two sets of H's, each in a pair, but maybe each as a doublet or singlet. Or perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to only two distinct aromatic protons.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are meta or ortho. But for a di-substituted benzene with two substituents that are the same, like two ester groups, the symmetry could lead to two types of H. Alternatively, if the substituents are different, maybe leading to more H types. Hmm, but since there are only two signals, maybe the substituents are in positions that make the ring have some symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in para positions relative to each other. Because in the case of para substituents, the ring would have two sets of equivalent H's, each as a pair. So that would give two signals for the aromatic H's.

Next, the NMR has two vinyl protons. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to double bonds, so perhaps there are substituents with double bonds. Wait, but the ring itself is aromatic, which is a conjugated double bond system. So the vinyl protons might be part of an adjacent double bond, like in a substituent group.

The vinyl H's: one is a doublet, another is a doublet of quartets. So maybe there are two sets of vinyl H's. For example, in a structure where there is a double bond in a substituent, perhaps an ester group with a vinyl group attached.

Wait, ester groups are typically O-CO-O, but that's not a double bond. Oh wait, esters have carbonyl groups (C=O),
