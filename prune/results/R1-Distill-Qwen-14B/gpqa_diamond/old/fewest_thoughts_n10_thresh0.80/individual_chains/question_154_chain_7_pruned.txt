Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% abundance. Then there's another peak at m/z 158, which is 32%. Hmm, the molecular weight is likely 156, but the 158 peak might be something else. Maybe a fragment or an isotope? Wait, molecular ions can sometimes show isotopic peaks. Chlorine has an atomic weight around 35, so maybe the molecule has a Cl. The molecular weight would be 156, so if Cl is present, maybe the formula could help.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But since it's broad, maybe it's an O-H, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So that's either a ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, ester, or maybe an amide. But the broad peak probably rules out aldehyde (sharp O-H in aliphatic aldehydes, but maybe not so broad). Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches which are broad, and their carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. Alternatively, an ester's carbonyl is a bit higher, around 1740-1750, but 1720 is a bit lower than that. Wait, or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, which can lower the wavenumber.

Now the 1H NMR. Let's look at the peaks: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). The 11.0 ppm is a strong clue. That's a very deshielded proton, likely an -OH in a carboxylic acid or maybe an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But 11 is even higher. Could it be an aldehyde? Or maybe an acidic proton. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, so maybe it's an -OH from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the NMR, the peak is at 11, not a broad peak though. The description says 's', so singlet. Carboxylic acid O-H is usually broad, but if it's a deuterated solvent, maybe it's exchanged and not observed. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, but the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 as a singlet. 11 seems high. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic O-H? But phenol O-H is around 5-7 ppm. Unless it's something more acidic, like salicylic acid. Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak which could be the O-H. So maybe the 11 ppm is a carbonyl group, but wait, carbonyl is usually not observed in 1H NMR. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, looking again. The IR has a broad peak in 3500-2700, which would align with O-H (like carboxylic acid), and a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is around the carboxylic acid carbonyl region. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

In the NMR, the 11 ppm is probably the -OH of the carboxylic acid, but perhaps in the data provided, it's a singlet. But wait, usually carboxylic acid -OH protons are broad and can be difficult to see because they exchange rapidly. However, if the solution is concentrated or in a certain solvent, maybe it's a sharp peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Wait, but the aldehyde would have a different IR. Aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1720, but their O-H (if any) would be a stretch in a different region. Wait, no, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, wait, that's right. Aldehydes have a C=O stretch around 1720, and the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm. So if the NMR has a singlet at 11, maybe that's not an aldehyde. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

So, looking at the NMR, the 8.02 and 7.72 ppm are doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests two sets of protons, perhaps in a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, two doublets would indicate two sets of protons in a para-substituted benzene ring, like two substituents opposite each other. So, maybe a para-substituted benzene with another substituent.

Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents. Let's think: the substituents could be a Cl and a COOH group. So, like 4-chlorobenzoic acid. In that case, the benzene ring would have two substituents: Cl and COOH in the para positions. The NMR would show two doublets because of the substituents causing the protons on the ring to be in two different environments, each with two equivalent protons.

Wait, but let me think about the integration. The 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H) would add up to 4H, but the molecule has a benzene ring with four protons (since two substituents are present). Wait, no, a benzene ring has six protons. If it's para-substituted with two substituents, like Cl and COOH, then the ring would have two sets of two protons each. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are Cl and COOH on the benzene ring. The ring would have two double
