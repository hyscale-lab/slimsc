Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. So, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, and they're in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The planets are Planet_1 through Planet_5, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, specifically between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Also, all planets have the same albedo, which I think means their reflectivity is the same, so that won't affect the calculation here.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing infrared radiation. The formula I recall is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). But wait, since all the planets have the same albedo, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So I can ignore that part for now.

Wait, the key formula is the one for the effective temperature, right? The formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is T = ( L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * D^2) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. Alternatively, it's often expressed in terms of the star's temperature and radius, but if we
