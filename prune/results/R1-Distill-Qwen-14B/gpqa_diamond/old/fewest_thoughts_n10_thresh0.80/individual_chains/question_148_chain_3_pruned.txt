Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.

The problem is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. We'll call them A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, etc. So each A is a different compound.

The first part says that A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Hmm, but wait, the oF for A2 is given as 31.96%. I'm not exactly sure what oF stands for here—maybe the oxidation state of fluorine? Because fluorine usually has an oxidation state of -1, but in some compounds, it can be different. Wait, but 31.96% seems like a mass percentage. Oh wait, maybe oF is the oxidation state percentage? Or perhaps it's the molecular formula's fluorine content.

Wait, maybe "ɷF" stands for the oxidation number of fluorine. Let me think: common oxidation states for fluorine. Oh, wait, fluorine usually has an oxidation state of -1, but in some compounds, like in certain interhalogen compounds, it can vary. Alternatively, maybe the 31.96% is the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.

So, if A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, let me think of possible compounds. For example, maybe A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one plus F2. Like, say, YF3 decomposing into YF2 and F2? But wait, Y can't be a group 2 element because that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not sure yet.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, it can oxidize Xe. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a fluorine-containing compound that's a strong oxidizer. For example, F2 is a strong oxidizer, but maybe A1 is more like a peroxide or something else.

Wait, if A1 is a compound like YF3, which is a stronger oxidizing agent than YF2. Or maybe it's a higher fluoride. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a fluorine-rich compound.

Then, A3 can interact with xenon, which implies it's also a reactive compound. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So maybe A3 is YF, YF2, YF3, etc. But let me consider what Y could be.

Wait, the problem says five binary compounds are known between Y and fluorine. So Y must be an element that forms five different fluorides. Let's think about which elements form
