Okay, so I've got this science question about rotavirus and some experiments done with mice. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll think this through.

The question starts by saying that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice via oral gavage. Oral delivery makes sense because rotavirus is an intestinal pathogen, so it would be taken in through the digestive system. 

Then, the in vivo imaging shows that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, stomach acid is really acidic, so maybe the GFP tag got broken down there. But some made it past that and got entangled in the intestinal mucus. Intestinal mucus is known to trap pathogens and prevent them from reaching the immune system, I think. But the ones that did reach the secondary lymphoid organs, which are like Peyer's patches, were identified. 

They isolated the proliferating cell population from these Peyer patches. So the Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're sites where immune responses to gut pathogens initiate. 

When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes of these cells, there was high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that some process is causing the genes to change, making different versions of the same receptor or antibody. 

Looking at the options, let's think about each process:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is where B cells mutate their antibody genes after activation, leading to more diverse antibodies. It happens after the initial antigen recognition, especially in the germinal centers where B cells proliferate and mutate.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. Doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but doesn't create new variable regions. It's more about the type of antibody produced, not the diversity in the antigen-binding site.

D) VDJ recombination: This occurs during the initial development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's the process where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to create the diverse variable regions of the heavy chains. But wait, this happens during the maturation of B cells, not in response to a specific antigen. 

But in the scenario, the GFP-tagged proteins reached the Peyer patches, which suggests an immune response is being triggered. The cells are proliferating there, so probably after antigen recognition. Somatic hypermutation occurs during the germinal center reactions where B cells mutate their variable regions, leading to higher affinity antibodies. So if the variable regions are showing high variability, that points to somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but VDJ recombination is a development process, so it's already happened before the immune response. So the high variability in the isolated cells must be due to mutations after the initial gene rearrangement.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence from the GFP-tagged proteins is observed to be destroyed by stomach acid in some cases, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population within them is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

To determine the process responsible for this variability, the following options are considered:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs after antigen recognition, particularly in germinal centers, where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions to increase antibody diversity. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cells in the Peyer patches.

- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of antibodies.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not generate new variable regions, making it irrelevant to the observed variability.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process occurs during B cell maturation in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are rearranged to form diverse variable regions. However, this process occurs before the immune response and does not account for the variability observed in the experiment.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cells in the Peyer patches is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response to an antigen, leading to increased diversity in antibody production.

Answer: A
