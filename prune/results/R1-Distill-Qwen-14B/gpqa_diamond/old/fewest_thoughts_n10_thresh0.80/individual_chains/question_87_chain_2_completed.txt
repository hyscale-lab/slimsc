Okay, so I've got this question about an aromatic compound and its NMR spectrum. Let me read it again carefully. The question says the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, di-substituted aromatic ring. So the benzene ring has two substituents. Wait, but the total carbons are 8. So the benzene is 6 carbons, so the two substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a single carbon? Or maybe one is two carbons and the other is none? No, since it's di-substituted. So each substituent must contribute one carbon, or maybe one is more than that. Wait, wait. Let me think: benzene is 6 carbons. Two substituents, each adding what?

Wait, the total is 8 carbons. So 8-6=2 carbons from the substituents. So two substituents, each adding 1 carbon. But wait, substituents on a benzene can be more than one carbon. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is nothing? No, because it's di-substituted. So both substituents are present.

Wait, maybe the substituents are groups like -OCH3 or something. Because the IR shows a carbonyl group. Wait, no. The FTIR shows a carbonyl, which is C=O. So one of the substituents must be a carbonyl group. And the other substituent is a halogen because of the aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait, the carbonyl group is part of a substituent. So, for example, it could be an acetyl group attached to benzene, but that would add two carbons (like in acetophenone). So if the benzene has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group (like OCH3? No, OCH3 is an ether, not a carbonyl. Wait, a carbonyl could be a ketone group, like -COCH3, but that would add two carbons (the CO is part of the substituent). Alternatively, another possibility is a carbonyl as a substituent, perhaps an aldehyde group? But aldehyde is -CHO, which is one carbon.

Wait, let's think step by step.

The compound has a benzene ring (6 carbons) plus two substituents making the total 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent is one carbon, or one is two and the other is zero? No, because it's di-substituted, so both substituents are present.

So, maybe the substituents are a -CO- group attached as part of a larger substituent. Alternatively, something like a -COOR group.

But wait, the substituents can't be both carbonyl groups, because the IR only says a carbonyl is present. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl and another is a halogen.

Wait, but the substituents are -X (like Br, Cl) and a carbonyl group. Let me think about the possible structures.

So, the substituents are -X (halogen) and -COR (a carbonyl group). Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, but let's think about the di-substituted benzene. Depending on the substituents' positions, the NMR signals would change.

Wait, the question is about the 1H NMR, so let's think about each option.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each has different ppm values and integration.

We know that the FTIR has a carbonyl (so there's a C=O group, which would be in the region ~1700 cm-1). Also, an aromatic-halogen bond (X being Cl, Br, etc.), which usually shows up around 600-800 cm-1.

So the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group, or a ketone, or aldehyde), and the other is a halogen atom.

Wait, wait, but a carbonyl group would be part of a substituent. So for example, the substituents could be -COCH3 (acetyl) and -X (like Cl). So the molecule would be something like para-substituted benzaldehyde? Or maybe more accurately, let's see.

Wait, let's consider the substituents. If one substituent is a carbonyl group, like -COCH3 (acetyl), which adds two carbons (the CO and the CH3), but wait that would make the total substituents add three carbons (since benzene is 6, substituents are 2 (acetyl adds 2, but wait, no, the acetyl is O=C-CH3, so that's a two-carbon substituent (the O is not a carbon). Wait, wait, no, the substituent is an acetyl group, which is -COCH3. So that's two carbons (the CO and the CH3). So the benzene ring has substituents of -COCH3 and -X (halogen, like Cl).

Wait, but wait, the total number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6, substituents: COCH3 (3 carbons? No, wait, the COCH3 is two carbons: the carbonyl is one (C=O), and the CH3 is another. So substituent is -O-CO-CH3? No, wait, substituent is -COCH3, which is an acetyl group. So that's 2 carbons (the CO is one, the CH3 is another). So if one substituent is -COCH3 (2 carbons), and the other substituent is X (like Cl, which is one atom, but adds zero carbons), then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. So that matches.

So the structure could be something like 1-chloro-4-acetyl benzene, or para-substituted.

Alternatively, substituents could be in the ortho or meta positions.

But the NMR data depends on the positions of the substituents and their neighboring protons.

So looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)

High ppm at 9.9 suggests an aldehyde proton (CHO), which is a strong deshielded proton. So if the substituent is an aldehyde, then this would make sense. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which could be an aldehyde (C=O). So if one substituent is an aldehyde (-CHO), then another substituent is X (like Cl).

But wait, -CHO is a substituent. If the substituents are -CHO and -X (Cl, Br), then the structure is something like o-, m-, or p-substituted aldehyde and halogen.

In the case of para substitution, the aldehyde would be opposite the halogen. Then the aromatic protons would be in certain patterns.

But in the NMR, the proton at 9.9 is a singlet, which would correspond to an aldehyde proton. That would make sense. Then what about the aromatic protons?

If the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent, the remaining protons would be two doublets.

Wait, but in para substitution, the substituents are on opposite positions. So if the substituents are -CHO and -X (Cl), then the aromatic ring would have four equivalent protons? No, because the substituents would be in para positions, so the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, benzaldehyde itself has a ring with substituents. Let me think about the NMR of para-substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent.

But I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the NMR signals. The aromatic region in option A has 7.8 and 7.6, both doublets, each integrating 2H. So four aromatic protons, which would make sense if two substituents are present, each causing two equivalent protons on either side.

Wait, but if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two sets of protons: two pairs of equivalent protons.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the ring would have more complex splitting.

But in this case, with substituents as -CHO and -X (Cl or Br) in para positions, perhaps the aromatic protons would be as two doublets.

Wait, but the aldehyde proton would be a singlet at around 9.8-10.5 ppm, which matches option A's 9.9 ppm (s).

So in option A, we have an aldehyde proton, and the aromatic protons as two doublets (7.8 and 7.6), each integrating to 2H. That suggests the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So the substituents are para, leading to two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. So that would make sense.

But wait, what about the other substituent? If one substituent is -CHO and the other is -X, then the ring would have two substituents in para positions. So the aldehyde would be in position 1, and the X (like Cl) in position 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, but since substituents are in 1 and 4, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each pair would be a doublet. So in the NMR, two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches option A.

Additionally, the other signals in option A are at 3.7 ppm (2H, s). What could that be? 3.7 ppm is around where OCH3 groups appear. But wait, we thought the substituents were -CHO and -X. So why is there a 2H singlet at 3.7 ppm? That could be a -OCH2- group or something else. Wait, but our substituents are -CHO and -X. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not -CHO and -X. Because the carbonyl group could be part of a ketone. For example, the substituent could be -COCH3 (an acetyl group), and the other substituent is -X.

So let's think about that structure. Benzene ring with substituents -COCH3 and -X in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would again be in two doublets, as in option A.

But then, what about the 3.7 ppm singlet? The acetyl group has a CH3 attached to the carbonyl. The CH3 would be a singlet, but around 2.6 ppm. Wait, no. Acetophenone (benzene with -COCH3) has the CH3 around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. But option A has a singlet at 3.7 ppm, which is more like OCH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is not an acetyl group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group that's part of an ester or something else. Let me think. If the substituent is -COOR, where R is a methyl group, then the ester's R would be a CH3 attached to O. But in that case, the OCH3 would resonate around 3.7 ppm as a singlet. So perhaps the substituent is -COOCH3 (like a methyl ester). Let me calculate the carbons.

If the substituent is -COOCH3, that's three carbons: the COO and the CH3. But wait, the total carbons from substituents can't be three because the total is 8. Benzene (6) + substituents (two substituents) should sum to 8. So each substituent must contribute 1 carbon. But -COOCH3 would be three carbons in the substituent. Wait, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen. Wait, but then the substituents would be -CO- (as in benzoyl chloride maybe?), but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a ketone. Let me think: for example, a substituent like -COCH2Cl. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl and a halogen, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let's look at the other options. Maybe the correct answer is not option A.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H. That suggests a CH3 group attached to something deshielding, like a carbonyl. So that would be a ketone (like in acetophenone: the CH3 would be around 2.6 ppm, but here it's 2.3). Or perhaps it's an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehyde's CH3 is not present; aldehyde is R-CHO. So in this case, the CH3 at 2.3 ppm could be part of a ketone. So substituent is -COCH3. Then, the other substituent is a halogen.

Wait, but the aromatic protons in option C are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests the substituents are para, leading to symmetric protons. So substituents are para: -COCH3 and -X (like Cl). So the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. Thus, option C's NMR would fit this structure.

But wait, the substituent -COCH3 would have a CH3 group, which would appear as a singlet around 2.6 ppm. But option C shows a singlet at 2.3, which is a bit upfield. Also, if the substituent is an acetyl group, the 2.3 ppm is plausible.

But the FTIR has a carbonyl group. So that would fit. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets because of the substituents being para.

So in option C, the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets. That makes sense for para substitution.

But wait, in option C, the integrals are 2H each for the aromatic regions, and 3H for the CH3. So that suggests that the molecule has a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl, which is a substituent on the benzene.

So the structure would be something like p-acetylchlorobenzene? Or wait, no, because the substituents would be -COCH3 and -Cl or Br.

But wait, the substituents are -COCH3 and -X. So the aromatic ring has two substituents: an acetyl group and a halogen.

But then, the IR would show a carbonyl (from the acetyl) and a C-X bond (from the halogen). That matches the question.

But let's think about the NMR.

In para substitution, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. So for example, in 1,4-dichlorobenzene, the aromatic protons are two doublets. Similarly, in 1-acetyl-4-bromobenzene, the aromatic protons would be two doublets.

The acetyl CH3 would be at around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. Option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is a bit upfield, but possible due to neighboring groups or electron-withdrawing effects.

So option C's NMR would fit this structure.

But wait, what about the other options?

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). Those look like two sets of -OCH2 groups, perhaps in an ether. Like maybe a structure with OCH2CH2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted group with two -OCH2 groups. But I don't see how that would fit with a carbonyl and a halogen. So probably not.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm is a singlet, which might be an aromatic proton in a para position, but that's a bit low for aromatic protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted proton, but I'm not sure. The 4.8 and 4.6 could be adjacent protons, like in a di-substituted ethylene group, but I'm not certain. But without a clear connection to the substituents, perhaps this is less likely.

So back to the options A and C. The question is about the substituents: one is a carbonyl, the other is a halogen.

In option A, the singlet at 9.9 ppm is an aldehyde proton. So substituents would be -CHO and -X. In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which is what option A shows. The 3.7 ppm (2H, s) is a bit confusing, because if substituents are -CHO and -X, where would that 2H come from? Maybe it's some other group, but I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -OCH2 group but that would be a substituent, but the substituents are only two.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is not -CHO but another group with a CH2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone and the other a halogen.

So substituent groups are -COCH3 and -X. Then, the CH3 would be a singlet around 2.6, but option C shows a singlet at 2.3. So perhaps in option C, the substituent is -COCH3 and -X, leading to two aromatic doublets and a singlet for the CH3.

So, in that case, option C's NMR would match.

But I thought earlier that the substituents are -CHO and -X, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. So that could be either a ketone or an aldehyde. Let me think: which option fits better.

If substituents are -COCH3 (ketone) and -X (halogen), then the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, and a CH3 at ~2.3 ppm as a singlet. So the NMR would look like option C.

Alternatively, if substituents are -CHO (aldehyde) and -X, the NMR would have an aldehyde proton (singlet around 9.9), and the aromatic protons as two doublets. But then, where does the 3.7 ppm (2H, s) come from? That's a mystery. It would require another group with two equivalent protons, perhaps an OCH2 group, but that would add more substituents.

Wait, the total substituents are two. So if one substituent is -CHO and the other is -X, the molecule would have only two substituents. So the NMR shouldn't have any other signals besides those from the aromatic protons and the aldehyde and any other protons from substituents. But the 3.7 ppm in option A is 2H, s. That would require a substituent with two protons, like -OCH2- or -CH2O-. But in our case, the substituents are -CHO and -X, which don't contribute any protons except the aldehyde.

Wait, but that leaves the 3.7 ppm signal unexplained, unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -COOCH3 group. So that would be a methyl ester. Then, substituents would be -COOCH3 and -X. But then the substituents would have three carbons (COOCH3) and one (X), totaling 4 carbons. But the molecule's total is 8 carbons, which would be 6 (benzene) +4 (substituents) = 10, which is over. So that can't be.

Wait, no, because the substituents are -COOCH3 (which is three carbons) and -X (zero carbons). So 6 +3 =9, which is more than 8. So that's not possible.

So perhaps substituent one is -COCH2Cl. Wait, but that's a longer substituent. Let me count: benzene (6) + substituent -COCH2Cl (4 carbons: the CO is two, CH2Cl is another, but wait, CO is O=C-, then CH2Cl. So the substituent is three carbons? Or maybe not. Wait, no, the substituent is -COCH2Cl, which has three carbons: the carbonyl (C=O) is part of the substituent, then the CH2Cl. So that substituent is three carbons, which would make the total 6 +3 =9; again, not matching.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the possible structures that have a carbonyl and a halogen substituent on the benzene ring, with a total of 8 carbons.

So two substituents, each adding 1 carbon (since 8-6=2).

So substituent 1: carbonyl group (like -CO-) but then how many carbons does that add? The carbonyl is a group, so for example, -COH (but that's a hydroxyl group, not a carbonyl). Alternatively, the substituent is -COR, which would add R's carbons. For example, -COCH3 would add two carbons (the C=O and CH3). But that would make substituent 1 = two carbons and substituent 2 = zero (if substituent 2 is a halogen, which adds zero). So 6 + 2 =8, which fits.

So substituent 1 is -COCH3 (acetyl), substituent 2 is -X (like Cl).

So the structure is benzene with substituents in para positions: -COCH3 and -Cl.

So in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets (each 2H). The acetyl group's CH3 would be a singlet around 2.6 ppm, but in option C, it's at 2.3. Let me think: perhaps it's a bit downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the Cl. Or maybe it's another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is not -COCH3 but something else.

Wait, what about a ketone substituent like -CO-. No, that's O=C-, but that's only one carbon, but then the substituent would be -CO-. Wait, but that would be part of a larger group, like -CO-R, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).

The 2.3 ppm singlet integrates to 3H, which is likely a CH3 group attached to something electronegative, like O or a carbonyl. So that's a good fit for a ketone's CH3 (as in acetophenone). So in this case, the substituents are -COCH3 and -X.

So, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets. The substituents are para, leading to symmetry, so the NMR would have two doublets in the aromatic region. That's what option C shows.

So the NMR would have:

- 7.8 ppm: 2H, d (next to the carbonyl)
- 7.6 ppm: 2H, d (next to the halogen)
Wait, no, the substituents would influence the chemical shifts. The -COCH3 is electron-withdrawing, which would deshield the adjacent protons, making them appear downfield. The -X (like Cl) is also electron-withdrawing, which would also deshield the adjacent protons, but the effect might be a bit different.

Wait, actually, the substituents can cause different shifts. The protons ortho to the carbonyl would be more deshielded, appearing at higher ppm. Those ortho to the Cl would also be deshielded, but perhaps not as much as the ketone's effect.

In option C, the higher ppm is 7.8, which would correspond to the protons ortho to the carbonyl group, and the lower ppm, 7.6, would be ortho to the Cl.

So, in this case, option C's NMR would fit the structure.

Alternatively, in option A, the 3.7 ppm singlet of 2H could be a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like -OCH2-. But then where is the carbonyl?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group and a carbonyl. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, and the substituents are di-substituted.

Wait, but the problem says the FTIR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond, so we have a carbonyl group and a halogen substituent.

So, the substituents are -X and -COR (where R is a methyl group). So, substituent 1 is -X (like Cl), substituent 2 is -COCH3.

So the structure is benzaldehyde with substituents para.

Wait, but that would give the aromatic protons as two doublets. The CH3 would be a singlet at ~2.3 ppm.

So option C's NMR would have the aromatic protons, and the CH3. So that seems to fit.

Which option has that? Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).

So that looks correct.

Wait, but what about the other signals? In option C, there's no other signals except these three. So the molecule would have those three groups: the benzene, the COCH3, and the X.

So that's correct.

Therefore, the correct answer must be option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. This means the benzene ring (6 carbons) has two substituents contributing a total of 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X). Based on this information, the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH3, an acetyl group) and a halogen (e.g., -Cl, -Br).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks at 9.9 ppm (1H, s) suggest an aldehyde proton (-CHO).  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, consistent with para-substitution.  
   - The peak at 3.7 ppm (2H, s) is unusual, as it suggests a -OCH2 group, which is not consistent with the substituents (-CHO and -X).  
   - **Conclusion**: This option does not fit the expected structure.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d) and 4.6 ppm (2H, d) suggest adjacent protons, likely from an ether or similar group.  
   - The peak at 1.3 ppm (3H, s) could correspond to a methyl group.  
   - These signals are inconsistent with the presence of a carbonyl group and a halogen substituent.  
   - **Conclusion**: This option does not fit the expected structure.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, consistent with para-substitution.  
   - The peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) corresponds to a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (e.g., -COCH3).  
   - This matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with substituents -COCH3 (acetyl group) and -X (halogen).  
   - **Conclusion**: This option fits the expected structure.

4. **Option D**:  
   - The peak at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) is unusual for aromatic protons and does not fit the expected splitting pattern for a di-substituted benzene.  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d) and 4.6 ppm (2H, d) suggest adjacent protons, which are inconsistent with the substituents.  
   - **Conclusion**: This option does not fit the expected structure.

### Final Answer:
The correct structure is a para-substituted benzene with substituents -COCH3 (acetyl group) and -X (halogen). The NMR data in **Option C** matches this structure, with aromatic protons as two doublets and a singlet for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.

**Answer: C**
