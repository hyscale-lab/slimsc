Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and the immune response in mice. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice via oral gavage. Then, through in vivo imaging, some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, others get entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They then isolate the Peyer's patches and look at the variable heavy chain genes, which show high variability. The question is about the process happening here.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated. When antigens, like rotavirus, are ingested, they pass through the intestinal mucosa and are taken up by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells or M cells in the Peyer's patches.

The fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid probably means not all the tagged proteins make it through. The ones that do reach the Peyer's patches are then taken by these immune cells. The variable heavy chain gene sequencing showing high variability makes me think this has to do with the immune response's diversity.

Wait, the options are about different processes in immune cells. Let's look at each option:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process that occurs in B cells after they have been activated, leading to diversification of the antibody variable regions. This happens in secondary lymphoid organs like lymph nodes and spleen, but also in Peyer's patches?

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, involving the complement system to attack pathogens. But I'm not sure how that ties into the variable heavy chain variability. Maybe not directly.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which happens after the initial response, but it's about the type of antibody, not the variability. So this might not be it.

D) VDJ recombination: This is during the early stages of B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the diverse antigen receptors. But wait, this happens in the bone marrow, not in the secondary lymphoid tissues like Peyer's patches. Also, the question says they're looking at the variable heavy chain after activation, so maybe this isn't the process here.

So, the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests that the B cells are undergoing some form of diversification after antigen exposure. Somatic hypermutation occurs after the initial VDJ recombination in the bone marrow. It's a process that occurs in mature B cells, especially in germinal centers, where they undergo hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies. This happens when the immune system is responding to an antigen, leading to affinity maturation.

In this case, the mice have ingested rotavirus, which is taken up by the Peyer's patches. The B cells in these patches would then take up the antigen and present it. Once activated, these B cells would undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their receptors, which would be reflected in the variable heavy chain genes. That would explain the high variability observed when they sequenced the genes.

Wait, but when do Peyer's patches B cells do this? I think that Peyer's patches are more about the initial encounter with the antigen. But the process of somatic hypermutation happens in the germinal centers, which are present in lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid organs, including perhaps Peyer's patches. Or maybe the B cells in Peyer's patches can form such structures.

Alternatively, could this be about the initial formation of the B cell receptor, which is during VDJ recombination? No, because VDJ happens in the bone marrow, during B cell development before they go into circulation. The question is about after they've encountered the antigen and have started proliferating in the Peyer's patches.

So the high variability in the variable regions after antigen exposure suggests that each B cell has a different variable region due to mutations. That's somatic hypermutation.

So the correct answer would be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP being delivered to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence is observed in the Peyer's patches, a type of secondary lymphoid organ, where the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells show high variability. This suggests a process that generates diversity in the immune response.

Key points to consider:

1. **Peyer's Patches**: These are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where antigens, such as rotavirus, are taken up by immune cells like dendritic cells or M cells.

2. **High Variability in Variable Heavy Chain Genes**: This indicates a process that diversifies the antigen receptor repertoire. Somatic hypermutation is a mechanism that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors after antigen exposure, leading to increased diversity and affinity for specific antigens.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells in secondary lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer's patches, after antigen exposure. It explains the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
   - **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
   - **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., IgM to IgG) but does not explain the variability in the variable regions.
   - **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and sets the initial diversity of B cell receptors. However, it does not account for the observed variability after antigen exposure.

Given that the question focuses on variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in activated B cells in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches.
