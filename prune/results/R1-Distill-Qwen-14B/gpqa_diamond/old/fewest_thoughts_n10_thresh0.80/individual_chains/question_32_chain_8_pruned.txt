Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it provides to a nucleus. Hmm, let me see what I know. The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, what's that? Oh right, lithium has 3 protons normally, and if it has 3 neutrons, then it must be Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass number. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², but I think it's more precise to look up the exact mass for Li-6. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the atomic mass or just the mass of a nucleon times the number.

Wait, I think the standard approach is to approximate the mass of the nucleus as the number of nucleons multiplied by the mass of a single nucleon. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, using the exact atomic mass might be better. But if I don't have the exact mass given, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation.

Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron, so each is around 938. So total rest mass would be 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's just an approximation. The actual atomic mass might be a bit different because binding energy comes into play, but for high-energy physics, I think the rest mass is considered as the sum of the rest masses of its constituents. Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the atomic mass including electrons? No, the nucleus is just the protons and neutrons, so electrons aren't part of it. So I think the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6 times the mass of a nucleon.

Wait, but perhaps I should check the actual mass. I remember that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6 * 938.272 MeV/c². Let me calculate that. Oh wait, but maybe I should look for the actual mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the formula for relativistic energy.

The speed is given as 0.96c, so I can calculate the gamma factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute 1/0.28. Hmm, 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, more accurately: Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Let's see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So yes, 1/0.28 is 3.57142857 approximately.

So gamma is about 3.57143.

So the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So E = gamma * m_rest * c². But since m_rest is in GeV/c², when I multiply by c², the units are GeV.

So E = gamma * m_rest.

So I need to find m_rest of the Li-6 nucleus. Let's compute that. Li-6 has 6 nucleons.

Assuming each nucleon has a rest mass of approximately 938.272 MeV/c² (I think that's the more precise value for a proton). So m_rest = 6 * 938.272 MeV.

Let me compute that: 6 * 938.272 = 5629.632 MeV, which is 5.629632 GeV.

So then E = gamma * m_rest = 3.57143 * 5.629632 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.57143 * 5.629632.

Hmm, let's compute it step by step.

First, 3 *5.629632 is 16.888896.

0.57143 *5.629632. Let me compute 0.5 *5.629632 = 2.814816.

0.07143 *5.629632. Let's see, 0.07 *5.629632 is about 0.394074. 0.00143 *5.629632 ≈ 0.008076. So total approx 0.394074 + 0.008076 = 0.40215.

So 0.57143 *5.629632 ≈ 2.814816 +0.40215= 3.216966.

So total E is 16.888896 + 3.216966 = 20.105862 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.1059 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm,
