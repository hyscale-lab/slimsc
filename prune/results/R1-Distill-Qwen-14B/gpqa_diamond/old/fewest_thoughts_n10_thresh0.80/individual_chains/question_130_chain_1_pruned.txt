Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and redshift and stuff. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. They want to find the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A to D, with numbers like 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So when that light is absorbed by hydrogen, it's because the hydrogen is moving away from us, right? So redshift comes into play here.

Redshift is given by z. The formula I remember is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). Oh wait, right, that's the basic equation. So if the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (which is about 121.6 nm, putting it in the far UV), and if the observed wavelength is longer, that means redshift.

But the question is about when this line is detectable by optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere blocks it. So if the Lyman alpha emission is redshifted into the optical range, ground-based telescopes can detect it.

So the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm (violet) to about 700 nm (red). So 4000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms. Wait, wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So for it to be observed in the optical range, say, the shortest wavelength optical is around 400 nm, so 4000 Angstroms.

So let me set up the equation. The observed wavelength lambda_obs must be in the optical range. Let's take the red end of optical, maybe 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), but actually, the lower limit is when lambda_obs is just within the optical. Wait, no, wait. If the quasar's Lyman alpha is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, but because of redshift, it's observed longer. So for it to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be at least 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), because anything shorter than that is UV, which we can't see from ground.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when something is redshifted, the observed wavelength increases. So if the Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms) is redshifted into the optical, which is longer than 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So the minimum red
