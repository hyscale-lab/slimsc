Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets using the TTV method. Hmm, TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? But I'm not sure how that affects this problem. Maybe it's just context that the planets were discovered that way.

The problem states that there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So each planet's period is a multiple of the first one. For example, Planet_2 has a period twice that of Planet_1, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, and so on.

The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, which I remember affects how much light they reflect. Since albedo is the same, it won't factor into the temperature ratio calculation.

Equilibrium temperature... I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and 'a' is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, or maybe it's T proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since the star is the same for all planets, the L and σ and other constants would cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the inverse square law. The flux received by a planet is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star. So, if a planet is at a distance a, the flux F is proportional to 1/a².

Since equilibrium temperature depends on the fourth root of the flux (because of the Stefan-Boltzmann law), the temperature T should be proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(0.5). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the temperature ratio would be sqrt(a2/a4), because when you take the inverse, it becomes sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, let me clarify. Let me denote the equilibrium temperature as T. The formula is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a² D^2))^(1/4), but since L and D (distance between star and planet)
