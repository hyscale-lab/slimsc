Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I remember that spin 1/2 particles, like electrons, have their own magnetic moments. The question says the magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz, which makes sense because the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin component along the magnetic field direction.

So initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, so it's in an eigenstate of Sz. That means it's either spin-up or spin-down along Z, right? When the field is turned off, the particle is no longer in an eigenstate of any particular spin component because the magnetic field determines the preferred direction for the spin states.

Wait, but then another magnetic field is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude B. Oh, so the particle is now in a magnetic field pointing along Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field change.

I think this has to do with how the spin precesses under a magnetic field. Because when the magnetic field direction changes, the spin state will evolve over time, causing the expectation values of the spin components to oscillate.

Let me recall the concept of spin precession. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is given by H = -μ·B. Since μ = γ S, and B is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ B S_y. Wait, the direction of B is positive Y, so H = -γ B S_y. Or maybe it's H = -μ·B = -γ S·B, so if B is along Y, it's H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, the energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian. But since the system is no longer in an eigenstate of S_y (it was aligned along Z before, which is perpendicular to Y), the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

To find the oscillation frequency, I should find the energy difference between the two possible states and use that to find the frequency. The energy levels for spin 1/2 would be E = ±(1/2) γ B ℏ? Wait, because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, right. So the energies would be E_+ = (γ B) (ħ/2) * (-1), wait no: wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, S_y is an operator with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = -γ B S_y. So the eigenvalues of H would be E = -γ B (± ħ/2) ) = ∓ (γ B ħ)/2. So the energy difference between the two states is ( (γ B ħ)/2 ) - ( - (γ B ħ)/2 ) ) = γ B ħ. 

Wait, no, the energy levels are E_+ = -γ B (ħ/2) and E_- = γ B (ħ/2). So the difference is E_+ - E_- = (-γ B ħ/2) - (γ B ħ/2) )= -gamma B ħ. Wait, but that's not right because the energies should have a difference of 2 times the energy of each state.

Wait, actually, the difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = [ (-gamma B * ħ/2 ) ] - [ (gamma B * ħ/2) ] = -gamma B ħ. Wait, the magnitude is gamma B ħ, but since frequency is related to the energy difference, the absolute value is what matters.

But wait, energy differences lead to oscillations in the system. The oscillation frequency is given by (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ. So (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. But wait that can't be right because the units—gamma has units of (rad/s per Tesla) or something like that. So when multiplied by B (Tesla), you get rad/s, which is correct for frequency.

Wait, but wait another thing. The original question is about the oscillation of the expectation value of the z-component of the moment. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the z-component is mu_z = gamma S_z. So the average of mu_z oscillates in time. The frequency of this oscillation is the same as the energy difference between the two states divided by ħ, right? Because the time dependence comes from the exponential terms in the state's time evolution.

But wait, the energy levels are E_+ and E_-, so the transition frequency would be (E_+ - E_-)/ħ. Let's compute that. E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- is gamma B (ħ/2). So E_+ - E_- is (-gamma B ħ/2) - (gamma B ħ/2) ) = -gamma B ħ. So the magnitude is gamma B ħ. Divide by ħ gives gamma B.

Wait, but wait. That's the frequency we're talking about. So the oscillation frequency omega would be gamma B. So the average of mu_z oscillates at gamma B.

But wait, let me think again. The initial state when the magnetic field was along Z. The spin is aligned, so it's in a state |+z> or |-z>. When the field is switched to Y, the initial state isn't an eigenstate of S_y. So the state will be a superposition of |+y> and |-y> states, which are eigenstates of S_y. The time evolution will cause the state to precess, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The time evolution of a state that's a superposition of two energy eigenstates leads to oscillations in expectation values at a frequency equal to the energy difference divided by ħ. So in this case, the energy difference is (gamma B ħ), so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me consider the Hamiltonian again. H = - mu · B. Wait, no—mu is gamma S, and the magnetic field is B along y. So H = - mu · B = - gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, it's H = -gamma B S_y.

The eigenvalues of H are found by H |ψ> = E |ψ>, where |ψ> are the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenvalues S_y can be ± ħ/2. So E = -gamma B (± ħ/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ/2 + gamma B ħ/2 = gamma B ħ.

The oscillation frequency is (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B. 

But the question is about the z-component of the moment. So mu_z is gamma S_z. What's the time dependence of <mu_z>?

Wait, initially, the spin is along Z. So the initial state is |+z> or |-z>. When the field is turned on along Y, the state will evolve as a combination of |+y> and |-y>, each with a time-dependent phase. 

The expectation value of S_z would oscillate because the state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, which have different S_z components. The time evolution introduces phase differences, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference, which we found to be gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B. So the answer should be B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and another field is applied along the $+Y$ direction (with the same magnitude $B$), the particle's spin state evolves over time, leading to oscillations in the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of $S_z$ due to the magnetic field along $+Z$. When the field is switched to $+Y$, the particle is no longer in an eigenstate of $S_y$, as $S_y$ is the relevant spin component for the new magnetic field direction. The Hamiltonian for the system becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$, where $S_y$ has eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The energy eigenvalues are therefore $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar / 2$.

The energy difference between the two states is:

\[
\Delta E = E_- - E_+ = \gamma B \hbar.
\]

The oscillation frequency of the expectation values of the spin components is determined by the energy difference divided by $\hbar$:

\[
\omega = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \gamma B.
\]

The magnetic moment $\mu_z$ is related to $S_z$ by $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. Since the time evolution of the spin state introduces oscillations in $\langle S_z \rangle$, the same frequency applies to $\langle \mu_z \rangle$. Thus, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**B) $\gamma B$**

Answer: B
