Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about binary star systems. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for each system.

For system_1, the RV variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s. We need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass considered is the sum of the masses of the two stars in each system.

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The idea is that each star orbits the common center of mass, so their velocities are related to their masses.

I think the formula involves the mass function, which relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses. Let me recall. The mass function for each star is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where i is the inclination angle of the orbit. But wait, since both stars are in a binary system, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence smaller velocity.

Wait, yes, the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So in system_1, the two RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So star A has 10, star B 5. So the velocity ratio is 2:1. That would imply that the mass ratio is inverse, so M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A = (5/10) = 1/2. So M_A is half of M_B. So the total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = (0.5 M_B) + M_B = 1.5 M_B. Or, alternatively, M_A = (1/3) total mass, M_B = (2/3) total.

Similarly for system_2: RV amplitudes 15 and 10. So star C has 15, star D 10. The velocity ratio is 15/10 = 3/2. So mass ratio M_C / M_D = (v_D / v_C) )= (10/15) = 2/3. So M_C is 2/3 of M_D. So total mass is M_C + M_D = (2/3 M_D) + M_D = (5/3) M_D. So M_C is 2/5 of the total, M_D is 3/5.

But wait, how does this relate to the masses and the period? Oh, right! There's Kepler's third law involved here. The period of the binary system is given by P^2 (G(M1 + M2)) / (4 pi^2 a^3
