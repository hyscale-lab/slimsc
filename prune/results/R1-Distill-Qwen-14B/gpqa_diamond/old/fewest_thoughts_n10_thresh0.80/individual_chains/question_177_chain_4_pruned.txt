Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity depends on a few factors, like radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here, which says that the luminosity L is proportional to the radius squared multiplied by the temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but wait, does mass directly relate to temperature here? I'm not sure. I think in main-sequence stars, more massive stars are hotter, but I'm not certain if that's the case here. The question says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so maybe I can use that.

The problem also mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but then if T1 equals T2, and R1 is 1.5 R2, then the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). Since T1=T2, the T terms cancel out. So it becomes ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is 2.25, option D is 2.23. Wait, but wait, there's more in the question. 

Wait, the question mentions radial velocities. Oh right, their radial velocities are 0 and
