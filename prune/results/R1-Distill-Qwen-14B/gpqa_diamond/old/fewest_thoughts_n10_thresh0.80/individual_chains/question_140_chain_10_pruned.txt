Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Another part mentions a product from a keto acid reacting with X, which has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

First, I'll try to identify what each part refers to.

Substance X: Incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is probably a diatomic molecule where one of the atoms has a heavier isotope. Like maybe O2 or something else. Wait, but the product from reacting X with a keto acid has a product with 2 oxygen atoms. So X might be something that adds an O or similar.

The reaction with Y is violent and releases gas W. Gas W's molecule has same neutrons and protons. Let's think about such gases. H2O? No, that's liquid. Hmm. Maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 C, 16 O each. Wait, but W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think: for each molecule, the number of protons and neutrons are same across all atoms? Or each molecule's total protons equals total neutrons.

Wait, the question says 'the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.' So for each molecule, total protons equal total neutrons.

So for example, H2O: H has 1p, O has 8p. So total p = 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8 (since O is 16, 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total neutrons = 0*2 + 8 =8. 10 vs 8: not equal.

Another gas: maybe CH4? No. Wait, another possibility: NH3? No, but again, their molecule's protons and neutrons.

Wait, common gases: perhaps CO? Let's see.
