Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. The equilibrium temperature ratios are given between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 as about 2.3. Also, the mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, with all having the same albedo of 0.3, similar to Earth.

Hmm. I remember that equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature, as I recall, is T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance. Since all have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking ratios.

The ratio of temperatures between two planets would then depend on the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Wait, no, let me think again. Because T is proportional to [L/(D²)]^0.25. So if T1 is the temperature of Planet1 and T2 of Planet2, then T1/T2 = sqrt(sqrt(L1/(D1²)) / sqrt(L2/(D2²)))). Oh wait, but if we're assuming the same star, L is the same for all planets. So the ratio simplifies.

Right, so the equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (D2/D1) )^-0.5. Wait, no, let's do it more carefully. The equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * (1 - a)^0.
