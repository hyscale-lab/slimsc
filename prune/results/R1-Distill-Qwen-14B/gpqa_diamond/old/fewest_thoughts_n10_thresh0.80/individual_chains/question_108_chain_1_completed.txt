Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They're asking about the paramagnetic coupling term's magnitude compared to the transition energy ΔE, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether H's expectation value is much bigger, much smaller, or similar to ΔE.

Wait, first, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? Oh right, I think it's related to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton, right? So μ = -gμ_B m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, the question mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Oh maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh orbital m is for angular momentum, but paramagnetism is about spin, so perhaps m here refers to the spin quantum number? Or maybe the problem statement has a typo? Hmm, or maybe they're talking about the Zeeman effect, which involves orbital and spin contributions.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term in the Hamiltonian is usually the Zeeman term. So the Hamiltonian would be something like H = -μ·B. For an electron, the magnetic moment is μ = γ s, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But wait, the spin is s = (1/2)ħ, so μ = γ (1/2) ħ.

But let me get back to the problem. The paramagnetic coupling term is the energy due to the magnetic interaction. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels, like the Lyman or Balmer series.

So I need to compute the paramagnetic term and compare it to ΔE.

I think the formula for the energy of the paramagnetic term is E = -μ·B. Wait, but the expectation value. So <H> would be proportional to m (the quantum number) times B. But wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, for spin, m_s can be ±1/2.

Wait, the problem says "small values of m", so m is small. Maybe m is the orbital quantum number, which for an s orbital is 0, p has m= -1,0,+1, etc. But if m is small, perhaps it's considering the orbital contribution, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic term being discussed is the spin-orbit coupling, but that's more about the interaction between the electron's spin and its orbital motion. But the question says paramagnetic coupling, which is usually the Zeeman effect, involving the magnetic moment and the external field.

Wait, the Zeeman effect comes into play when an atom is placed in a magnetic field, causing the energy levels to split. The energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, m is usually associated with the orbital angular momentum, but the paramagnetic effect is due to the spin, so maybe it's m_s, the spin magnetic quantum number.

Wait, for an electron, the spin magnetic moment is μ_s = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_s. And the Zeeman energy is E = -μ·B. So the expectation value <H> would be proportional to m_s * B. But m_s can be +1/2 or -1/2. So the magnitude is about (1/2) times some constant times B.

Wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274×10^-24 J/T. So the energy from the paramagnetic term would be E = -μ_B * m_s * B. Since B is 1 T, and m_s is ±1/2, the magnitude would be about (9.274e-24 J/T) * (1/2) * 1 T = 4.637e-24 J.

Wait, but that's for the spin part. If the problem considers the orbital part, then m would be the orbital magnetic quantum number, which for an s orbital is 0, p is -1, 0, +1, etc. But the question says small m, so perhaps it's considering m=0, which would make the orbital contribution zero, so the main contribution comes from spin.

But wait, the problem asks about the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think refers to the spin part. So the energy would be on the order of μ_B * B * (1/2).

Now, what about the transition energy ΔE? The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 4.861e-7 meters. That's the Balmer-alpha line, I think, which is the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen. Wait, wait, no, hydrogen's Balmer series is transitions to n=2. The 0.486 micrometer line is n=4 to n=2, I believe. Let me think: The Balmer-alpha line is n=4 to n=2, which emits at about 486 nm, which matches 0.486 micrometers.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So let's compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / 0.4861e-6 J.

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by denominator: 0.4861e-6 m → 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.089e-19 J.

Wait, so the transition energy ΔE is about 4e-19 J.

What's the paramagnetic term again? It's on the order of μ_B * B * m_s. Since m_s is 1/2, and B is 1 T:

E_paramag = μ_B * (1/2) * B = (9.274e-24 J/T) * 0.5 *1 T = 4.637e-24 J.

So comparing E_paramag (4.6e-24 J) with ΔE (4e-19 J). Oh wait, E_paramag is much smaller. Because 4.6e-24 is 10^-5 times smaller than 4.6e-20, which would be 1e-5 times smaller than 4.6e-19. Wait, wait, 4.6e-24 is 1e-5 times 4.6e-20? No, wait 4.6e-24 is 1e-4 times 4.6e-20? Let me see:

Wait, 4.6e-24 is 4.6 × 10^-24 J.

ΔE is about 4.089e-19 J.

So the ratio is E_paramag / ΔE = (4.6e-24) / (4e-19) ) ≈ (4.6/4) * 1e-5 ≈ 1.15e-5.

So E_paramag is about 0.00115% of ΔE. So E_paramag << ΔE.

Therefore, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the question asks which one is bigger. Since the paramagnetic term is much smaller, the correct option would be C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

The Bohr magneton is 9.274e-24 J/T. So with B=1 T, and m=1/2, the paramagnetic term is 9.274e-24 * (1/2) = ~4.637e-24 J.

ΔE is hc/lambda. Let me compute that more precisely.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value now, since it's a defined constant)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact)
lambda = 0.4861 micrometers = 0.4861e-6 meters.

So E = (6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8) / 0.4861e-6.

Calculate numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 1.9864e-25 J·m.

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m:

1.9864e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = 4.082e-19 J.

So yes, that's correct.

So E_paramag is 4.6e-24 J, which is about 4.6e-24 / 4.08e-19 ≈ 1.128e-5 times ΔE. So definitely much smaller.

Therefore, the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy. So the answer is option C, which says ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. For a spin-½ electron, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin magnetic quantum number \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). The energy of this interaction is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{paramag}} = \mu_B \cdot m_s \cdot B
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton (\( \mu_B \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \)) and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). Substituting \( m_s = \frac{1}{2} \), we find:  
   \[
   E_{\text{paramag}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = 4.637 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Transition Energy \( \Delta E \)**:  
   The transition energy corresponds to the energy difference between two atomic levels. The wavelength of the emitted photon is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3.0 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   To compare the two energies, we compute the ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{E_{\text{paramag}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{4.637 \times 10^{-24}}{4.089 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1.13 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows that \( E_{\text{paramag}} \) is approximately \( 0.00113\% \) of \( \Delta E \), meaning the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Thus, the correct option is **C**, as \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

Answer: C
