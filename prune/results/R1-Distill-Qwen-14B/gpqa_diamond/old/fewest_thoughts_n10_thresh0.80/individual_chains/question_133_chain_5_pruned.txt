Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Their molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, which probably relates to activity coefficients, but maybe we can assume ideal behavior for this problem.

The problem gives me the three dissociation constants for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. I remember that these are the steps where H3PO4 loses protons to become H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, so orthophosphate is the deprotonated form, PO4^3-. I need to find its concentration in the solution. How do I approach this?

I think I should look at the salts given. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. These can interact in solution through the phosphate buffer system.

Wait, but wait. The phosphate buffer system has multiple equilibria. The relevant ones here would be the dissociation steps that relate to H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12

So, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

But since both salts provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, I think the solution is a buffer involving these two species. Wait, but in this case, we have two different phosphate species in solution. So, perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but then we also have the possibility of some PO4^3- forming.

Alternatively, maybe the solution can be considered as a
