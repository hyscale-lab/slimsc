Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read the question again and break it down.

So, the chemist does two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

Hmm. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is used in epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation typically occurs at the double bond.

Wait, but when epoxidation happens, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product. So for each starting material, the reaction might produce different epoxides.

Let me think about Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is trans. When mCPBA adds, it adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide. The addition is stereospecific, so the configuration of the starting alkene will influence the epoxide's structure.

Similarly for Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene. The starting alkene is cis, so the epoxide formed might have a different configuration.

Wait, but waitâ€”epoxidation with mCPBA is a peracid reaction, which generally proceeds via an electrocyclic opening. The peracid adds across the double bond, leading to the formation of an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will form with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. The peracid attacks the double bond. The reaction typically occurs with a concerted mechanism, so the geometry of the alkene determines the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

Wait, so (E)-oct-4-ene is trans. The double bond is between C4 and C5 in octene. So when mCPBA adds, the epoxide forms. The cis addition would lead to a trans epoxide? Or wait, maybe the opposite.

Wait, no. The peracid adds across the double bond in
