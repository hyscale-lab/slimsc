Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that when they talk about elemental abundances using the EW method and LTE, they're probably referring to equivalent widths and Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which are methods used in stellar spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements.

The given data includes the masses of the stars and their elemental abundance ratios. Let me list out the given information:

Star_1:
- Mass = 1.5 solar masses
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- Mass = 1.2 solar masses
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And for the Sun's photosphere:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Wait, I think the notation is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY in star) - log(nX/nY in sun). That is, [X/Fe] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Fe compared to solar.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, no. Wait, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of (X/Y ratio in star) minus (X/Y ratio in sun). So [X/Y]_star = log(X/Y in star) - log(X/Y in sun) = log( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun )

So yeah, that's correct.

So, I think I'll need to find the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2, because the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, no, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2. So maybe (nSi in Star_1) / (nSi in Star_2).

Wait, but to find that, I'll need to find nSi in each star relative to hydrogen, then perhaps use the other elements to link the ratios.

Let me think. Let's process each star step by step.

Starting with Star_1:

We know [
