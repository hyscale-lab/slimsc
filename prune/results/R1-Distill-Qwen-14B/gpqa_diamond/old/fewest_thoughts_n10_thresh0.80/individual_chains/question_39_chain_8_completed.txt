Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm. So, we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when we measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, I think this is about the normalization condition of the wave function.

Right, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, which means the integral of the probability density over all space should be 1. Probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that down: ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i.

Wait a second, that's a complex wave function. The probability density is |ψ(x)|². So, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3, and set it equal to 1.

But wait, the wave function is written as a function with an imaginary component. Let me compute the modulus squared. Let me denote A = a/sqrt(1+x), so ψ(x) = A - 0.5i. Then, the modulus squared is A² + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number as a + ib, the modulus squared is a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

Wait, but the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2, so a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but integrating this from 1 to 3 would give me the normalization condition.

So, integrating [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me compute each part separately. The integral will be the sum of two terms: integral of a²/(1+x) dx and integral of 0.25 dx.

The second term is easy: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

The first term: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. Let me make a substitution: u = 1+x, so du = dx. When x is 1, u is 2. When x is 3, u is 4.

So the integral becomes a² * ∫ (1/u) du from u=2 to u=4. The integral of 1/u is ln(u). So, a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

So the first term is a² ln(2).

Putting it all together, the normalization condition is:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.693.

So, 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.721.

Then, a² ≈ 0.721, so a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I handle the wave function correctly? The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, so the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. That seems right.

Oh wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the wave function is a function of x, but the imaginary part is a constant, not dependent on x. That's interesting. So the modulus squared would have the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared. Wait, but if the imaginary part is a constant, that's correct.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function typically has both real and imaginary parts, but in this case, the imaginary part is a constant. So when we compute |ψ(x)|², it's the sum of the squares of real and imaginary parts.

So I think I did that correctly.

Wait, but another thing to consider: what if the wave function is supposed to be normalized, but the given form is such that the integral must be 1, but including the imaginary part. So my approach is correct.

So a² ln(2) + (3-1)*0.25 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) equals 1. 

The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Thus, the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \),  
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \).

For the second term, \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5 \).

For the first term, let \( u = 1+x \), so \( du = dx \). When \( x = 1 \), \( u = 2 \), and when \( x = 3 \), \( u = 4 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_2^4 \frac{a^2}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_2^4 = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.693} \approx 0.721 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
