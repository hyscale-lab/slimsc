Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus. The question is asking me to calculate the energy so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and their energy is related to their speed. 

Wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass of the nucleus would be based on the mass of Li-6.

I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Relativistic energy is given by the equation E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v²/c²). 

So first, I'll calculate gamma. Let me plug in v = 0.96c into the formula. So v² is (0.96c)² = 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.0784 is the same as 784e-4, so sqrt(784e-4) is 28e-2, which is 0.28. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. Then gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. 

Wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me be more precise. Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784. Let me think again. 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly, so yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately... I'm not exactly sure of the exact value. Let me think. A proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938) + 3*(939) MeV. Let's compute that: 3*(938 +939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV. That's 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than that. Because when you combine nucleons, you have mass defect due to binding energy. But wait, in the context of this problem, do I use the exact mass or the sum of individual nucleons? Hmm, the question says 'the energy of the RHIC', which is for colliding heavy ions. I think for this purpose, we may approximate the mass as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Because binding energy is usually considered as part of the rest mass, but when calculating kinetic energy or total energy, it might be necessary to include it. But I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the problem is about the total energy of the nucleus. The rest mass includes the binding energy as well. So I should use the exact mass of Li-6. 

Wait, what's the precise mass of a Li-6 nucleus? Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0160293 amu. Oh wait, but wait, 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So let me calculate that. 

So, mass of Li-6 is 6.0160293 amu. Multiply by 931.5 MeV/amu to get MeV. Let's compute that:

6.0160293 * 931.5 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589
