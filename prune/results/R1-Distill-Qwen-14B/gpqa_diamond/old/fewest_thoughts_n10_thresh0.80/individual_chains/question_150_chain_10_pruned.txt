Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves an NMR analysis and a reaction sequence. I need to figure out the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data, then determine what the product is after the given reactions.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 8, H is9, N is1, O is1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl (1), but wait, maybe other combinations. Alternatively, maybe two rings and a double bond? But given the NMR data, maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents and an aldehyde group or something.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet around 9.7. A triplet might suggest coupling with two protons. A peak around 9.7 is typically an aldehyde proton, but wait, the integration is 1H. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe an aldehyde group. But wait, the splitting is a triplet. The aldehyde's proton usually doesn't split much because it's deshielded, but maybe in this case, it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Or perhaps it's an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a double bond, leading to coupling with two protons.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). Those are in the aromatic region, about 6.5-7 ppm. The doublets suggest coupling with one adjacent proton. So maybe two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two para-substituted aromatic rings. For example, each pair is two protons in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe two para-substituted benzene rings, like two phenyl groups attached to something.

Next, 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. 2 protons. Might be an enol proton or something like that, but a singlet suggests no coupling. Wait, but a broad signal could indicate exchange with water, like an -OH proton, but then it's integrating 2H. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to be deshielded but not split. Alternatively, it could be protons on a double bond adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, making them deshielded.

3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet integrating to 2H. So two protons, each coupled with one other proton. The chemical shift is 3.66, which is in the range for an OCH2 group, perhaps. Or maybe a CH2 adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl.

Putting this together. Let's think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, one oxygen.

Looking at the NMR:

- The aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm (but it's a triplet, so maybe it's attached to a CH2 group which is adjacent to a double bond or something else). Wait, but aldehyde is RCHO, so the aldehyde proton is on the end. If the aldehyde is attached to a CH2, like RCH2CHO, then the aldehyde proton would be adjacent to the CH2, which has two protons. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet because it's coupling with two protons on the adjacent CH2. That makes sense.

So structure might have a CH2CHO group.

Then, the aromatic protons. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets for 2H each. That suggests two para-substituted benzene rings. Each ring has substituents in the para positions. Maybe each benzene ring is attached to the main chain.

Wait, the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let's think about the possible groups.

If there are two benzene rings (each with 6 carbons, but that would be too much). Wait, no, the formula is C8H9NO. So, the entire molecule has 8 carbons. If two benzene rings are present, that's 12 carbons, but the formula has only 8. So that can't be.
