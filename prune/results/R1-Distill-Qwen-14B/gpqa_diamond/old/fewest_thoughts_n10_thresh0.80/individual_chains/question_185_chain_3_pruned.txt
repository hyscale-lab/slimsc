Okay, I'm trying to figure out the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator given here. The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, so maybe this has something to do with spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ · n would be the dot product, which is σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Oh right, because n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

I think the eigenvalues of a spin operator like this are related to the magnitude of the spin. Since each Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, right? Because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have eigenvalues ±1 when they're multiplied by some coefficients and added together.

But wait, the Hamiltonian here is a sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by ε and the components of n. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Now, the eigenvalues of such an operator would depend on the maximum and minimum possible values it can take. Because the Pauli matrices are being added, their combined effect would determine the energy eigenvalues.

Another approach: think about the expectation value. For any eigenstate, the expectation value of H would be ε times the expectation value of σ · n. But σ · n is a vector quantity, but the expectation value for a spin-1/2 particle in a direction n is ± ħ/2 times the component in that direction. Hmm, not quite sure about that.

Wait, the Pauli spin matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So for any direction n, the operator σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1 because it's a spin component. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin component in any direction can only be ± ħ/2, but here, the Pauli matrices are such that σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, let me think. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So S · n would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in this problem, H is ε times σ · n, which is the same as 2 ε times (S · n) / ħ because
