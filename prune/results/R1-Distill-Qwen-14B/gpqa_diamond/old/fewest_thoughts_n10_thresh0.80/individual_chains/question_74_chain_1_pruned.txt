Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows something called the exponential decay law. Let me think. The question says that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. Wait, that's the half-life concept, right? Or is it the decay constant?

Wait, no, the decay constant λ is related to the half-life. I remember the formula for the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-λt). Oh right, because the decay probability is complementary to the probability that the atom hasn't decayed yet.

So the problem is that we have an atom that hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, and we want the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait, so the total time from the start would be 50 plus 150, which is 200 minutes. But the given data is about 100 minutes. Hmm, maybe I should figure out the decay constant.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the decay constant λ using the given probability of 32% decay in 100 minutes.
2. Since the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the remaining probability is the starting point.
3. Then, calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50. Or wait, no—actually, in the next 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start. So the time from now is 150 minutes.

Wait, but the decay process doesn't depend on the previous time, right? Because radioactive decay is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. Wait, no—wait, the memoryless property is that the probability of decay in the next t minutes depends only on the current time, not on when you started watching. So even if 50 minutes have passed, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval. But wait, no, because the overall decay constant is a fixed rate.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because if you have a 32% chance of decaying in the first 100 minutes, then the decay constant λ is determined such that 1 - e^(-λ *
