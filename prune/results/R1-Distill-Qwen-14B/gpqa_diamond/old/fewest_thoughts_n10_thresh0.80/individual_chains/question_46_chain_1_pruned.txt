Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully. The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the catalyst breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is a ruthenium-based catalyst, right? It's good for ring-closing metathesis and also for cross metathesis. 

So, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-eneâ€”let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Pent means five carbons. So 1-ene is double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Pentane is five carbons. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But that's pent-1-ene. But we have a methyl group on carbon 3. So, in pent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. The 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So that would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the molecule is (CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3), or maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2C=CHCH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, let me number. Carbon 1 is the first carbon. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH- (double bond)
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, so structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So that's the molecule. And it's racemic, meaning it's an equal mix of two enantiomers (if there's a chiral center). Wait, but does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a chiral center? Let me think. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, the substituents on C3: what's attached to it? C3 is connected to CH2CH3, a methyl group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, the structure is CH
