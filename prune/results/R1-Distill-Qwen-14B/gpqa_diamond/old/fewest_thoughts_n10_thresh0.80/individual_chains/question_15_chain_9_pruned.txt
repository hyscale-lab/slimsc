Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit from the given options. Let me think through this step by step.

So the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. 

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, right, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius as Planet_1's. So same radius but different masses.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, more specifically, I think it's (2R_planet / a) * (1/(sqrt(e) * (1 + (m_star/(M_planet))^(1/3))))), but wait, wait, I think the main factors are the orbital distance, the size of the planet relative to the star, and the inclination of the orbit.

Wait, but since both planets are detected via RV, which tells us their minimum mass, but for transit probability, we also need the orbital inclination. RV doesn't require the orbit to be edge-on, but transit requires it to be exactly edge-on. Since RV can detect planets even if they don't transit, the probability is about how likely the orbital plane is aligned such that we see the transit.

Wait, but the transit probability is the geometric probability, which depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the distance. The formula I remember is P_transit â‰ˆ (R_star + R_planet) / a * (1 / sin i), but wait, no. Actually, I think the geometric probability is (R_star) / a. Because when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, the probability that it passes in front of the star (relative to our viewing angle) is higher if the star is smaller and the planet's orbit is closer.

Wait, maybe it's more accurate to say that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) /
