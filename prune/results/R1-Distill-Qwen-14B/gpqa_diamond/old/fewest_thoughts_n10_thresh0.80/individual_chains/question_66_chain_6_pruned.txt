Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with certain symmetries. But wait, what symmetries are we talking about here?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, I think that all the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because otherwise, the theory wouldn't be consistent with special relativity. Effective theories should incorporate the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. So Lorentz symmetry is a given. That would mean point 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Since Poincare includes both, if Lorentz is already enforced, does that mean Poincare is automatically respected? Or are they considered separately? I'm a bit fuzzy but I think that in effective field theories, Poincare symmetry is kind of a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require that all operators respect Poincare? Or is it that the theory as a whole must, but individual operators don't have to? Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must be Lorentz scalars. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, which implies they transform in a way that the operator stays the same under Lorentz transformations. So Poincare symmetry, which includes translations, is probably already a part of the structure. So do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But I think that the Standard Model and thus SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry, so all operators must respect it. Or maybe the question is whether each individual operator must respect Poincare.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. For an operator, when you do a Lorentz transformation, the operator must transform in such a way that the entire theory is invariant. But I'm not sure if SMEFT operators are required to individually respect Poincare
