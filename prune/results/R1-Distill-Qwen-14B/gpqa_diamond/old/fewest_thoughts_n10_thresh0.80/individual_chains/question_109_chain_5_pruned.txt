Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about nucleon systems and emitted particles. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to determine which partial wave is not permitted, given the options.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So, the initial state is 1S0. The 1 in 1S0 is the spin multiplicity, which is 2S+1. So, S here is 0 because 2(0)+1=1. The L is S in the spectroscopic notation, right? So, L is 0 for S orbital. The J is 0 because it's 1S0.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X. So, the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN plus X. But since X is emitted, I think the problem is about the transition from initial to final NN state, considering the conservation laws.

Wait, the problem says "the final NN state has T(NN) = 0." So, after emitting X, the NN pair has T=0. I think T is the isospin, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays in here. But the question focuses on angular momentum and parity, so maybe isospin isn't the main factor except for the given condition.

The condition given is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So, T is the isospin of the NN state, S is their total spin, L is their orbital angular momentum. So, for the final state, T=0. So, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That implies (S + L +1) is even, so S + L must be odd.

So, S + L is odd in the final state.

Now, the problem is about the allowed partial waves for the emission of particle X. Each option gives a transition where the initial state is 1S0 and the final state is some partial wave plus X. The options are A to D, each with different emitted particles (p, p, f, s), but I think the type of particle X affects the parity.

The key here is conservation of angular momentum and parity. Since the system is emitting a particle, we have to consider the initial and final angular momenta, and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some concepts. Let's break it down.

First, the initial state is 1S0. The 1 means 2S+1=1→S=0. The S0 means L=0 (since S is the spectroscopic notation for L), and J=0 because it's 1S0.

The NN system emits a particle X. So, the initial NN state is 1S0 (L=0, S=0, J=0). After emission, the NN state has some new quantum numbers. Let's denote the final NN state as having orbital angular momentum L', spin S', and total angular momentum J'. But the problem is about the partial wave of X, which relates to the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay.

Wait, no, the problem says the options are transitions like 1S0 → 7D1 + p, etc. So, the final state of the NN pair is 7D1, and X is p. Hmm, but wait, the notation in the options is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

Each option is in the form: 1S0 → (some state) + X. For example, option A is 1S0 →7D1 + p. I think the first part is the final NN state, and X is emitted. So, the decay is 1S0 (NN) → 7D1 (NN) + X (p).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is 1S0, and after emission, the NN state is in a different state, and X is emitted with some angular momentum. So, the options are possible final states, and we need to check which is not allowed.

Wait, the question says: "the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum."

So, the initial state is 1S0: 2S+1 =1 → S=0. L is 0 (since S is the spectroscopic symbol, S=0→ L=0). J is 0.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So, parity of X is -1.

The parity of the system (the initial and final states) must be considered. Since parity is a multiplicative quantum number, the parity of the initial state times the parity of X must equal the parity of the final state times the orbital angular momentum's parity effect.

Wait, when a particle is emitted, the parity of the process would be the product of the initial parity and the parity of X, and the final parity of the system (NN) and the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the decay process.

The initial state is NN in 1S0: parity is (-1)^L_initial, where L_initial is 0. So parity_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.

The final state is NN in some state (like 7D1) and the emitted particle X. The parity of the final state would be the parity of the NN state plus the parity of X, considering the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to think about the overall parity conservation.

Wait, the overall parity should be conserved in the decay if the interaction is parity-conserving. But in this problem, it's not clear whether the interaction is parity-conserving. Hmm. Well, the question says to "make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity." So, parity must be conserved in the process.

Therefore, the initial parity must equal the final parity.

The initial parity is the parity of the NN system: (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial=0, parity_initial=+1.

The final parity is the parity of the NN system (after emission) times the parity of X times (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay. Because
