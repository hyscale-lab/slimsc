Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a pion. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary, and I need to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D with various MeV values.

Wait, right, this is a particle physics problem, specifically a decay process. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite each other. That makes sense because momentum has to be conserved.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such a small (almost zero) rest mass. Since the problem gives the muon's rest mass, I'm assuming the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So mu+ is 105.7 MeV/c², and the pion is 139.6 MeV/c². 

I think I should calculate the energy released in the decay first. The rest mass of the pion is higher than the muon, so there's energy to be released as kinetic energy. But how much?

The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV. The muon is 105.7 MeV. But wait, the sum of the muon and the neutrino's rest masses must be less than the pion's mass, right? Because the pion is heavier, so it can decay into these particles. Let me see: 105.7 plus (almost 0) is less than 139.6, so that's good.

So the total energy available for kinetic energy is the difference between the pion's rest mass and the sum of the muon's rest mass and the neutrino's. But wait, since the neutrino's mass is negligible, the available energy is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. But wait, that's not the case, because in reality, some energy goes into the kinetic energy of both particles, not just one.

Wait, but wait. Because the neutrino has negligible mass, its kinetic energy might be considered as the same as its total energy. Or maybe I can model this using energy and momentum conservation.

Let me think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

The initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary.

After decay, the system has the muon and the neutrino. Let me denote the muon's rest mass as m_mu, and the neutrino's as m_nu. Since m_nu is negligible, I can approximate m_nu ≈ 0.

The total energy after decay must equal the initial energy. So,

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c².

And the total momentum must be zero, so the momenta of muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite.

So, p_mu = -p_nu.

Hmm, but since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.

The energies can be expressed in terms of their rest masses and momenta. 

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

E_nu = sqrt( (p_nu c)^2 + (m_nu c²)^2 )

But since m_nu is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu c.

But since p_mu = -p_nu, their magnitudes are the same. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So substituting into the energy equation:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c².

Let me plug in the numbers without units for simplicity, since c is a common factor and will cancel.

Let me divide everything by c² to make the equation dimensionless.

So, sqrt( p² + (m_mu)^2 ) + p = m_pi.

Wait, no, let's see: the equation without units would be:

sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) + p = m_pi.

Because m_pi c² = m_pi (in units where c=1), same for the others.

Wait, I think I should set c=1 for simplicity. Then,

E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 )

E_nu = p_nu.

And since p_mu = -p_nu, their magnitudes are the same. So p_mu = p, p_nu = p.

So,

sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = m_pi.

Let me plug in the numbers: m_pi = 139.6, m_mu = 105.7.

So,

sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Let me set x = p for simplicity.

So,

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for x. Let's subtract x from both sides:

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expand the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x^2.

So,

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x.

Now rearrange to solve for x:

2 * 139.6 x = 139.6² - 105.7².

Calculate the right side. Let's compute 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6 = Let me compute that.

Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait, no, that's actually not correct. Let me compute 139.6 * 139.6 properly.

Wait, 139 * 139 is 19321. Then, 0.6 * 139.6 * 2 plus 0.6^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute (139.6)^2:

Let me compute 139.6 * 139.6.

= (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2.

140^2 is 19600.

2*140*0.4 = 112.

0.4^2 is 0.16.

So, 19600 - 112 = 19488; 19488 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2.

100^2 = 10000.

5.7^2 = 32.49.

And 2 * 100 *5.7 = 1140.

So (100 +5.7)^2=10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So,

Right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

2*139.6 x = 8315.67.

Divide both sides by (2*139.6):

x = 8315.67 / (2*139.6)

Calculate denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2.

x=8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by, say, 100 to make it 83.1567 / 2.792.

Compute 2.792 * 30 = 83.76, which is a bit more than 83.1567.

So 2.792 * 29.77 ≈ 83.1567.

Wait, 2.792 * 29.7 = let's see:

2.792 *30=83.76 → 29.7 is 30-0.3 → 83.76 - (2.792 *0.3)= 83.76 -0.8376= 82.9224.

Hmm, 82.9224 is less than 83.1567. So the difference is 83.1567 -82.9224 = 0.2343.

So how much more than 29.7? Let's compute how much 0.2343 is in terms of 2.792.

0.2343 / 2.792 ≈ 0.0838.

So x ≈ 29.7 + 0.0838 ≈ 29.7838.

So x ≈ 29.7838.

Wait, but wait, x is p. So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c? Because units are in MeV/c.

Wait, but how did I get that? Let me double-check the calculation.

So x = (139.6^2 -105.7^2)/(2 *139.6) ?

Wait, no, earlier steps showed that 2 *139.6 x = 139.6² -105.7².

Wait, wait. Let me recap:

We had:

sqrt(x² + m_mu²) + x = m_pi

Then, sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Squared both sides:

x² + 105.7² = (139.6 -x)^2

Which becomes x² +105.7²= 139.6² -2*139.6 x +x².

Cancel x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x.

Rearranged:

2*139.6 x= 139.6² -105.7².

Which is the same as (139.6^2 -105.7^2)= (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7) = (33.9)(245.3) = let's compute that.

33.9 *245.3:

Compute as 33.9*(200 +45.3) = 33.9*200=6780, 33.9*45.3= ?

33.9 *45 = 1525.5, 33.9 *0.3=10.17 → 1525.5 +10.17=1535.67.

So 6780 +1535.67= 8315.67.

So yeah, same as before. So 2*139.6 x =8315.67 → x=8315.67/(279.2)≈29.78.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2: ≈ 886.8.

105.7^2=11172.49.

Sum is 11172.49 + 886.8 ≈ 12059.29.

sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.81 MeV.

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is rest energy + kinetic energy.

Rest energy of muon is 105.7 MeV.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈4.11 MeV.

Wait, but wait! The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c → since p=29.78 MeV/c, E_nu=29.78 MeV.

Because E_nu = pc, as its rest mass is negligible.

So the muon's KE is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That seems to match.

Wait, but wait, the options list the KE of the product particles. So the KEs are approximately 4.11 and 29.78, which would round to 4.12 and 29.8. So option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for E_mu. Let me compute 29.78^2 more accurately.

29.78^2 = ?

29.78 * 29.78.

Let me compute 30*30=900. Subtract 0.22 from each factor.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 29.78² as (30 - 0.22)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.22 +0.22² =900 -13.2 +0.0484= 886.8484.

So 886.8484 + 11172.49= 12059.3384.

sqrt(12059.3384)= let's see.

109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 +0.04=12056.04.

109.8^2=12056.04.

12059.3384 is 3.2984 above that.

So sqrt(12059.3384)=109.8 + (3.2984)/(2*109.8) ) ≈109.8 + 3.2984/(219.6) ≈ 109.8 + 0.015 ≈109.815 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.815 MeV.

Thus, KE_mu= 109.815 -105.7=4.115 MeV ≈4.12 MeV.

E_nu=29.78 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV (muon) and 29.78 MeV (neutrino). Which matches option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's what I got. So the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary positive pion (\(\pi^+\)) into a positive muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)):

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\)
- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\)
- Neutrino mass: negligible (\(m_\nu \approx 0\))

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be equal.
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\(E_\mu\)) and the neutrino's total energy (\(E_\nu\)):
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = E_\mu + E_\nu.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The pion is stationary, so the total momentum before decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:
   \[
   p_\mu = -p_\nu \quad \Rightarrow \quad |p_\mu| = |p_\nu| = p.
   \]

### Energy and Momentum Relations:
The total energy of the muon is:
\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
and the total energy of the neutrino is:
\[
E_\nu = p.
\]
Using energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]

### Solving for \(p\):
Substitute \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\) into the equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Let \(x = p\). Subtract \(x\) from both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]
Square both sides:
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]
Expand the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x + x^2.
\]
Cancel \(x^2\) and rearrange:
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.
\]
Calculate \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Solve for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Muon's Total Energy**:
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Compute \(29.78^2 = 886.8484\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

3. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   KE_\nu = E_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
