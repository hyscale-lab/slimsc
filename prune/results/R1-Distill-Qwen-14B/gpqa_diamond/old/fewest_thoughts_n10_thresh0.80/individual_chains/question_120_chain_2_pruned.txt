Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their number density is the same in all directions. Parallax, plx, is the angle subtended by the star's apparent movement over the distance between the Earth and the Sun. So, the formula I remember is distance d (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of parallax, right? So d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. They're asking for the dependence on plx. I think I need to relate the number of stars in a certain parallax range to the actual volume of space that corresponds to that range.

Wait, parallax relates to distance, and stars are spread out, so the number of stars should depend on the volume. Oh, because as you go farther away, each shell has more volume, so more stars, but since the distribution is uniform, the number in each shell is proportional to the volume.

Volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius (distance) and dr is the thickness of the shell. Since d = 1/plx, the radius r is 1/plx. So if I take a small change in plx, delta_plx, what's the corresponding change in r?

Let me think. If plx increases, what happens to r? Well, if plx is small, say, near zero, then r is very large. But more accurately, plx is in arcseconds, and a change in plx by delta_plx corresponds to a change in r. Let's see. Let's denote plx as p. Then r = 1/p. So delta_r would be - (1/p²) delta_p. The negative sign just indicates that as p increases, r decreases.

But since we're dealing with absolute numbers, maybe I can ignore the sign for now. So, for a small delta_p, the change in r is approximately delta_r = - (1/p²) delta_p. But since we're considering a range from p to p + delta_p, the corresponding r would go from 1/p to 1/(p+delta_p), which is approximately 1/p - (delta_p)/(p²), because using a Taylor expansion, 1/(p+dp)
