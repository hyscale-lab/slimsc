Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

The question is asking which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. There are four options, A to D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum operators (like those for spin) have specific properties. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the components are ± ħ/2. But wait, in this case, the operator is Ay, which is the Y-component.

Wait, but the given matrix S must be the spin operator S_y for a spin-1/2 particle. Because the standard form for S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix with 0 -i in the first row and i 0 in the second row. Let me think. Yeah, I think S is given as such. So S would be (ħ/2) times that matrix, but in this problem, Ay is c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Hmm.

Wait, let me clarify. The S matrix here must be the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. The Pauli sigma matrices are usually defined as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. For spin-1/2 systems, the spin operators are S = (ħ/2)σ. So S_y would be (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. But wait, in this problem, the matrix S given is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly the sigma_y matrix without the (ħ/2) factor. So S here is actually the sigma_y matrix, not
