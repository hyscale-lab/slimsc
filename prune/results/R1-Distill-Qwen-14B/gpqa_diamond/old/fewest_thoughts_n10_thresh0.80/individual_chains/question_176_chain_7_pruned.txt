Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a normalized vector. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. So I should probably normalize this vector first.

So the state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To normalize it, I'll calculate the norm squared, which is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2. That's 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector is each component divided by sqrt(6), so [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

Next, the problem introduces two observables, P and Q. P is represented by a matrix. Let me write down matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, what does this matrix look like? Let me visualize it:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Wait a second, that's an interesting structure. It's a symmetric matrix, which is good because observable operators are Hermitian.

Then, the operator Q is given by the matrix:

Q = [
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

This looks like a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. That's helpful because measuring Q can only give these values.

The question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P. Wait, no. Actually, the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. We need the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, no, the order is important. The measurement of Q happens after P. So first, we measure P, get a result, and then measure Q on the new state. But wait, no, actually, the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So perhaps the order is measure P first, then Q. But I'm a bit confused; let's read the question again.

The question says: what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So the first measurement is P, getting 0, then measuring Q and getting -1.

So the process is: measure P, the state collapses to an eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, in
