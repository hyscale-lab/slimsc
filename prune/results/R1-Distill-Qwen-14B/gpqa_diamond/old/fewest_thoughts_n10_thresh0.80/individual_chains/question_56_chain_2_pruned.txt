Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through photon emission or absorption, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

First, I should recall the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the selection rules for the quantum numbers are: Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but for hydrogen, I believe the transitions are mainly governed by electric dipole transitions where certain quantum numbers change. Oh wait, more specifically, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the transition is allowed if the initial and final states satisfy these changes.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (since it's s orbital), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So we're going from 3s to 1s. But since it's a two-step transition, the electron must go through an intermediate state.

Let me think about possible intermediate states. The first transition could be from n=3 to n=2, but wait, can it go from 3 to 2? Or maybe 3→1? No, because for dipole transitions, the change in n is at least 1, but in two steps, perhaps it's 3→2→1.

Wait, maybe the first transition is from n=3 to n=2. Then, from n=2 to n=1 in the second step. Let's see.

But wait, the initial state is l=0. So the first transition should change l by ±1. So from l=0, l can go to 1 (since +1 is allowed). So the intermediate state must have l=1, and then from l=1, it can go to l=0 in the next step.

So the possible intermediate states after the first transition would be n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1. Because m can change by 0, ±1. So the possible m values for the first transition to n=2 would be m= -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the initial m is 0. So in the first transition, m can go to m= -1, 0, +1. So the possible states after the first transition would be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition must go from n=2 to n=1, and l must go from 1 to 0. So the second transition would have to change l from 1 to 0, satisfying Δl = -1. That's allowed. Also, m has to change by 0, ±1. So from m= something in the intermediate state, it can go to m=0 in the final state.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so m=0. The first transition can go to any m= -1, 0, +1, but the second transition must lead to m=0 in the final
