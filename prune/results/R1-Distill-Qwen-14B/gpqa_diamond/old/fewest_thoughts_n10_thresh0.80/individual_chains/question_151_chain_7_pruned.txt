Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. So the question is about calculating the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific value. Alright, the system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a minute, matrices in quantum mechanics are usually column vectors, right? So the state vector is a 3x1 matrix here.

The observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write that down. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, wait, noâ€”wait, no, each row is given for the matrix P. So P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P =
[ 0          1/sqrt(2)    0          ]
[1/sqrt(2)   0           1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0          1/sqrt(2)    0          ]

Wait, no. Wait, the description says the first row has elements (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), so that's correct. Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row is (0,1/sqrt(2),0). So P looks like a matrix with 1/sqrt(2) in the off-diagonal positions, but let me check the structure again. Hmm, perhaps it's a permutation matrix or something similar.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P, particularly the one that's zero, and then find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue. The probability will be the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in that eigenvector's direction.

Wait, but wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me think about normalization. Oh wait, in quantum mechanics, the state
