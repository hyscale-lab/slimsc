Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state is given as (3i, 4), which I think is a column vector. The options are four different expressions involving hbar (which I know is ħ, the reduced Planck's constant).

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator in question. In this case, the operator is S_y. But wait, I also recall that the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the spin operator S is given by S = ħ/2 * σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So for S_y, it should be (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli y-matrix, σ_y.

The Pauli y-matrix σ_y is given as a 2x2 matrix:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix. Let me write that out:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Now, the state vector is given as (3i, 4). I should write this as a column vector. So ψ is:

ψ = [3i; 4]

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually written as column vectors. So ψ is a 2-component column vector with the first component 3i and the second 4. That makes sense.

To find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ† would be the row vector [ -3i, 4 ], because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 (a real number) is 4.

So putting it all together, the expectation value is:

⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† * S_y * ψ

Let me compute each part step by step. First, let's compute S_y * ψ. 

Multiplying S_y (a 2x2 matrix) by ψ (a 2x1 vector) gives a new vector. 

Breaking it down:

The first component of S_y * ψ is:
(0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i

The second component is:
(i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*3i + 0. i*3i is 3i², which is 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y * ψ is the vector [ -4i, -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], so I need to multiply this row vector with the result of S_y * ψ.

So ψ† * (S_y ψ) = [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ].

Each element is multiplied element-wise and then summed. So:

(-3i) * (-4i) + 4 * (-3)

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = (12)(i^2) = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but wait, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y, right? So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix. So in the expectation value calculation, I have to include this factor.

Wait, no. Wait, when I computed S_y * ψ, I included the (ħ/2) factor. Oh wait no, no. Let me think again. Because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so when I compute S_y ψ, it's (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y ψ.

So when I compute ψ† S_y ψ, it's ψ† multiplied by (ħ/2) σ_y ψ. So the entire expression is (ħ/2) multiplied by ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I multiplied σ_y by ψ and then by ψ†, and then I get -24. So the expectation value would be (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but none of the options have -12 ħ. Let's check the options again.

Options:

A) -12 hbar/25

B) 12 hbar/25

C) 25 hbar/2

D) -25 hbar/2

Hmm, so where did I go wrong? Because my calculation led me to -12 ħ, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine my steps. Maybe I messed up the matrix multiplication.

Wait, the state is (3i,4), which is a column vector. So let me recheck the multiplication of S_y with ψ.

S_y is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] multiplied by ψ = (3i,4). So:

First component of S_y ψ: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = 0 -4i = -4i

Second component: i*3i + 0*4 = i*(3i) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3

So S_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T. Then, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† (S_y ψ) is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = (12) (i²) → 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the inner product is -24. Then, since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

But wait, all the options have denominators other than 1 or 2. So perhaps I messed up the initial state vector.

Wait, the state given is (3i,4), but perhaps it's supposed to be a
