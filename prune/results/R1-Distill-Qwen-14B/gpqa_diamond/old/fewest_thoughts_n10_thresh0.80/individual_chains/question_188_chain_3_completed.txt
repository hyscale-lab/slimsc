Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me try to remember what I know.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Hmm, wait—wait, the interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the lattice parameter, so that's 'a' in a cubic or rhombohedral system. So a = 10 Angstroms here.

The interplanar distance, d_hkl, is calculated using the formula from the Bragg's law. The formula for d_hkl in a crystal with lattice constants a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk)(cos alpha)/(a² b² sin^2 beta) ) Hmm, no wait, maybe that's not right. Oh wait, I think the general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit more involved.

Wait, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been skewed so that all edges are equal but the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the formula for d_hkl might be different. Let me think... Oh right! The formula for d in a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d² = (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )) / (h² + k² + l²)

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused because in a cubic system, the formula is simpler. Let me try to write it more accurately.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d² = [ (a²)(h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ] / ( (h² + k² + l²) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal (alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees here), and a=b=c. So this might simplify the formula.

Alternatively, I think there's a more straightforward formula when all angles are equal. Let me look it up mentally. Oh right, another approach is to use the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, because in a rhombohedral system, alpha=beta=gamma, so cos alpha is the same for all terms. So substituting, let me compute that.

But wait, in a cubic system, cos gamma is zero because gamma is 90 degrees, but in this case, gamma is 30 degrees. So that complicates things.

So given that, the (111) plane has h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula, d² = (a² (1 + 1 + 1)) / ( (1+1+1) ) - but wait, that's for a cubic system. But since the angles are 30 degrees, we can't ignore the cosine terms.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d² = [ a² (h² +k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) ] / (h² +k² + l²)

Wait, let me make sure. Another source I remember says that the interplanar spacing formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Since all angles are 30 degrees, cos alpha = cos beta = cos gamma = cos(30°). Cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So substituting h=1, k=1, l=1:

d² = a² / [ (3) - 2(1*1*0.8660 + 1*1*0.8660 + 1*1*0.8660) ]

Wait, simplifying the denominator inside the square root:

Denominator = 3 - 2*(3 * 0.8660) )

So 3 - 2*(2.598) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right because the denominator would be negative, leading to an imaginary number. That can't be possible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos γ + kl cos γ) )

But wait, that would give a denominator as (3 - 2*(3 * 0.866)) as earlier, which is negative. That can't be correct, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d² = [ a² (h² +k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) ] / ( (h² +k² + l²) )

Wait, that would be the same as before. So substituting:

Numerator: a² [ 3 - 2*(3 * 0.866) ] = a² [3 - 5.196] = a² (-2.196). Negative again.

So that's impossible, which suggests that I must have the formula wrong. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d² = [ (h² +k² + l²) a² ] / [ (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma + ... ].

No, maybe another way. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is:

d² = [ a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) ] / ( (h² +k^2 + l^2) (1 - 2 cos gamma + cos² gamma) ) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Oh wait, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case of a hexagonal system if gamma is 60 degrees, but in this case gamma is 30.

Alternatively, perhaps using the general formula for interplanar distance in a hexagonal system, but no, this is rhombohedral, which is a different system.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal can also be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the angles are all equal. So let's compute the denominator.

For (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So denominator = 1 +1 +1 - 2*(1*1 cos gamma + 1*1 cos gamma + 1*1 cos gamma )

Which is 3 - 2*(3 cos gamma )

gamma is 30 degrees, so cos gamma = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So denominator = 3 - 2*3*(0.8660) = 3 - 6 * 0.8660 = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative again. Which would result in d being imaginary, which can't be right. So I must have the wrong formula.

Hmm. Maybe the formula isn't correct. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic system, which is the most general case. A rhombohedral system is a special case of triclinic where a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma.

The general formula for interplanar spacing in triclinic is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2 hk (cos beta)/(a b) - 2 hl (cos gamma)/(a c) - 2 kl (cos alpha)/(b c)

But in rhombohedral, a = b = c = a, and alpha = beta = gamma = gamma, so this becomes:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l^2)/a² - 2 (hk cos gamma)/(a²) - 2 (hl cos gamma)/(a²) - 2 (kl cos gamma)/(a² )

= [ (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 hk cos gamma - 2 hl cos gamma - 2 kl cos gamma ] / a²

Which can be written as:

1/d² = [ (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 cos gamma (hk + hl + kl ) ] / a²

So the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 cos gamma (hk + hl + kl) )

Ah, that makes more sense. So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So substituting:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2 cos gamma (3) )

Wait, because (h² +k² + l^2) is 3, and (hk + hl + kl) is 3 because 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 =3.

So,

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos gamma )

Now, gamma is 30 degrees, so cos gamma is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So compute the denominator inside the square root:

3 - 6*(0.8660) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative again. That can't be right. So this suggests that the (111) plane is impossible in this rhombohedral system with these angles? But that can’t be. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the denominator inside the sqrt must be positive. So maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check again the general formula for interplanar distance.

Wait, another source I remember says that for a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Wait, but that again would lead to denominator 3 - 6*(0.866) ≈ -2.196, which is negative. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the reciprocal of cos gamma. Wait, no, that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink this. Another approach: the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system can be found using the vector approach.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, with angles between them of 30 degrees.

The plane (111) is defined by the Miller indices (1,1,1). The normal vector to this plane is in the direction (1,1,1). The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of this normal vector in reciprocal space, but I might be complicating things.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = 2π / |G|,

where G is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane. But maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using the volume of the unit cell. The volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

Wait, but in our case, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So:

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute each term:

sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, so (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 =0.75.

So 3*(0.75) = 2.25.

(sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3*sqrt(3))/8 ≈ 0.6495.

So 2*(0.6495) ≈1.299.

So V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 2.25 + 1.299 )

Which is sqrt( (1 - 2.25) +1.299 ) = sqrt( (-1.25)+1.299 )= sqrt(0.049) ≈0.2214.

So V = a^3 * 0.2214.

But how does this help with interplanar distance?

Wait, the volume is also equal to (a b c) sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma ), which for a rhombohedral system with a=b=c and same angles is the same as what I calculated.

But perhaps another approach is better. Let's think about the Miller indices. The interplanar distance d for (hkl) is given by:

d = 1/ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) ) / a

Wait, but that would give the same denominator as before, which is negative. So I'm back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )

But when the angles are such that the denominator is negative, then that (hkl) plane doesn't exist. But that can't be the case because the options are given, so the plane must exist.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 hk cos gamma )

But that's only in a cubic system, not rhombohedral. Wait, no, that's for a hexagonal system perhaps. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the formula with the hexagonal system. In a hexagonal system, the formula is:

d² = (a² (h² +k² + l² - hk)) / ( ... )

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let's compute the reciprocal of the (111) plane in the rhombohedral system.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h = (h, k, l) in the reciprocal lattice, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the direction of the plane's normal vector is (1,1,1), and the interplanar distance can be found using the scalar product.

Wait, the interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

d = (a) / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )) )

Wait, but that brings me back to the same problem where the denominator is negative. So let's double-check the calculation.

Wait, with h=k=l=1.

Then, the denominator is 3 - 2*(1*1 cos gamma + 1*1 cos gamma + 1*1 cos gamma) = 3 - 6 cos gamma.

With cos gamma = cos 30° = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 3 - 6*(0.8660) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

So denominator inside the sqrt is negative, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the structure factor approach, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming the angles are all 30 degrees. Let me double-check the problem statement.

The question says alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, could it be that the interplanar distance is calculated using the reciprocal of the denominator's magnitude?

Wait, suppose I take the absolute value. So denominator would be 2.196, positive.

So d = a / sqrt(2.196) = 10 / sqrt(2.196)

Compute sqrt(2.196): sqrt(2.25) is 1.5, so sqrt(2.196) is a bit less, perhaps around 1.48.

So 10 / 1.48 ≈6.756. But the options are around 9 Angstroms, so that's way off. So that approach must be wrong.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another formula or approach.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ))

But, wait, is that correct? Let me plug in the numbers.

So h=k=l=1, gamma=30 degrees.

Denominator inside sqrt becomes 3 - 2*(3)*cos(30) = 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

Which is 3 - 5.196 ≈-2.196. Again negative. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the magnitude of the reciprocal vector. The formula for the reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system is given by:

The reciprocal vectors are:

b1 = (1/a) (1, 1, 1) / sin( ... )

Wait, that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should refer to a textbook formula.

Wait, another thought: The interplanar distance for (hkl) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma + ... something )

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a term in the denominator. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula from the Miller indices and the angles.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But since alpha=beta=gamma=30, it's the same as before. So again, same problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 hk cos gamma )

But that's only for a cubic system with h=k=l? No, wait, that's the formula for a cubic system's (hkl) plane, but in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so cos gamma=0, which would make the formula d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l^2).

But in our case, the angles are 30 degrees, so perhaps the formula can't be applied directly.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors can be written as:

a1 = a * (1, 0, 0)
a2 = a * (cos gamma, sin gamma, 0)
a3 = a * (cos gamma, (cos alpha - cos gamma sin gamma)/sin gamma, (sin alpha)/sin gamma )

Wait, but since it's rhombohedral, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees.

So, let's compute a2 and a3.

a2 = a*( cos 30, sin 30, 0 ) = a*( sqrt(3)/2, 1/2, 0 )

a3 = a*( cos 30, [cos 30 - cos 30 sin 30 ] / sin 30, sin 30 / sin 30 )

Wait, let me compute the components:

cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660
sin 30 = 0.5

So a3_x = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660
a3_y = [ sqrt(3)/2 - (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ] / 0.5
= [ sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 0.5) ] / 0.5
= [ sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ] / 0.5
= sqrt(3)/2 * (0.5/0.5) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660

a3_z = sin 30 / sin 30 = 1.

So a3 = a*(0.8660, 0.8660, 1 )

Now, the (111) plane corresponds to the plane whose normal vector is (1,1,1) in the direction of a1, a2, a3.

The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the normal vector in the reciprocal space.

Wait, but maybe an easier way is to compute the scalar product.

The plane equation is given by (hkl) · (r) = d, where r is a point on the lattice.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) * (1, 1, 1) / ( ... )

Wait, maybe this is getting too involved. Let me think differently.

The formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )

But as I computed earlier, this gives a negative denominator, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. It leads to a negative denominator.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator's absolute value. Let's try that.

So, denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 6 cos(30) = 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3 sqrt(3) ≈3 -5.196= -2.196.

Taking absolute value, 2.196. So sqrt(2.196)≈1.48.

d=10 / 1.48 ≈6.756 Angstroms. But the options are around 9 Angstroms. So that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe the formula is different and I messed up the signs. Let me think about the general formula again.

I think I'm getting confused, so perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, another way: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But if the denominator is negative, that implies that the (hkl) plane does not exist in that system, but that can't be because (111) is a valid plane for a rhombohedral system.

So perhaps I have the formula wrong, and the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Wait, let's check that.

With h=k=l=1, denominator becomes 3 + 6 cos gamma.

cos gamma is ~0.866, so 3 + 6*(0.866)= 3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)≈2.863. So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.495 Angstrom. Not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the formula uses cos(180 - gamma) instead of cos gamma.

Wait, because in some conventions, angles are measured as 180 - gamma. So if gamma is 30 degrees, perhaps it's 150 degrees in the formula.

Wait, let me try that.

cos(150 degrees) = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.8660.

Then denominator would be 3 - 6*(-0.8660)= 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863, d=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the correct formula, but the denominator is negative, which would mean that the (111) plane is not allowed in this system. But that's not possible because the problem gives it as an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the denominator should be positive.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But given that, if the denominator is negative, perhaps it's impossible, but the problem gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let's consider the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma )

So with a=10 Angstrom, gamma=30 degrees.

Compute 1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3.

sqrt(3)/2 squared is 3/4 =0.75.

So 3*0.75=2.25.

(sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8 ≈0.6495.

So 2 * 0.6495=1.299.

So V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -2.25 +1.299 ) = a^3 * sqrt( (1 -2.25)+1.299 )= a^3 * sqrt( (-1.25) +1.299 )= a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a^3 * 0.2214.

So V=10^3 * 0.2214=1000 *0.2214=221.4 Ang^3.

But how does this relate to the interplanar distance?

Hmm, perhaps I can use the relation between the volume and the interplanar distance. The volume can also be expressed as (a^3) / (d * (h² +k² + l^2)^(3/2) ) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the volume is related to the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options.

The options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

Wait, if the formula gives a negative denominator, but the options are all around 9, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is for a hexagonal system and not rhombohedral. Let me check.

In a hexagonal system, the formula for interplanar distance is:

d² = (a² (4 h² + 2 h k + 4 k² +3 l²) ) / ( ... )

No, that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: maybe the crystal is cubic, but the angles are 30 degrees. Wait, no, the problem states it's rhombohedral.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator's absolute value.

So denominator is 6 cos gamma=5.196, 3-5.196= -2.196. So absolute value is 2.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(2.196) ≈10 / 1.482≈6.756 Angstroms. Again, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using the angle as 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me try that.

If gamma=60 degrees, cos gamma=0.5.

Denominator=3-6*(0.5)=3-3=0. So d approaches infinity, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma + 6 cos^2 gamma )

Wait, that's a possible variation. Let me compute it.

Denominator: 3 -6*(0.866) +6*(0.866)^2.

Compute each term:

3 =3.

6*cos gamma =6*(0.866)=5.196

6*(cos gamma)^2=6*(0.75)=4.5.

So denominator=3 -5.196 +4.5 = 3 -5.196= -2.196 +4.5=2.304.

So sqrt(2.304)=1.518.

d=10/1.518≈6.59 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) + 6 cos^2 gamma )

Wait, testing that.

Denominator =3 -6*(0.866) +6*(0.75)=3-5.196+4.5=2.304.

So sqrt(2.304)=1.518. So d=10/1.518≈6.59. Not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute the reciprocal of the denominator's absolute value but without the 2 in front.

Wait, denominator was 3 - 6*(0.866)= -2.196. So taking 2.196 as the denominator.

Wait, sqrt(2.196)=1.482.

d=10/1.482≈6.756. Still not matching options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the denominator's absolute value, but without the 2.

Wait, denominator=3 -3*(0.866*2)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the correct formula, despite the negative denominator, and take the absolute value of the denominator inside the sqrt.

So d=10 / sqrt(2.196)=10/1.482≈6.756. Not matching any options.

But the options are around 9 Angstroms. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a simple cubic system, but that would make d= a / sqrt(3)=10/1.732≈5.77 Angstroms. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for a face-centered cubic (FCC) system. But no, that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a primitive cubic system. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it's actually:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Wait, but that would be the same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos gamma) )

Wait, but I'm just randomly trying now.

Let me compute that.

h+k+l=3.

(h+k+l)^2=9.

2 (hk + hl + kl)= 2*3=6.

(1 - cos gamma)=1 -0.866=0.134.

So denominator=9 -6*(0.134)=9-0.804=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

So for our case, 3 +6*(0.866)= 3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstroms. Again, not matching.

Wait, but the options are much larger, around 9 Angstroms. So perhaps I should think about why I'm getting such a small number.

Wait, 10 Angstroms is the lattice parameter a. So the interplanar distance for a cubic system would be a / sqrt(3) ≈5.774 Angstroms. But the options are around 9, which is larger than a. So that can't be right.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) )

Which for (111) would be a/sqrt(3)= ~5.774 Angstroms. But that's not the case with the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) ) / ( ... )

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's consider the unit cell vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the unit vectors are a, b, c, with angles between each pair equal to 30 degrees.

The (111) plane can be thought of as being spanned by three vectors a, b, c, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the volume of the cell and the area of the plane.

Wait, the area of the (111) plane is given by the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors in the plane. But I'm not sure how to relate that to the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the (111) plane is A = | a × b | * | a × c | * | b × c | / ( ... )

Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and just see which option is approximately 10 / sqrt( (3 - 6*0.866 ) ), but even that approach is leading me to a negative denominator.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But in this case, since all angles are 30 degrees, it's the same as before. So back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me recompute 3 -6*(0.866). 6*0.866 is 5.196. 3-5.196= -2.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is wrong, and the correct denominator is positive.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

In that case, denominator=3 +6*0.866=3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.495. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Wait, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But in that case, denominator is negative as before.

Hmm.

Given that I'm stuck and can't find the correct approach, perhaps I should look for an alternative way or consider that the correct answer is around 10 Angstroms, but that seems unlikely as the options are around 9.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula for a simple cubic system. For (111), d = a / sqrt(3) =10/1.732≈5.774. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is different. Let's think, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )

But that brings me back to the negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which would give d=10 / sqrt(3 +6 *0.866)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )

But I'm stuck with the negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08. Let's see how that would come about.

If d=9.08, then from the formula:

d^2 = a^2 / denominator.

So denominator= a^2 / (d^2) = (100)/(9.08^2)≈100/(82.4)≈1.214.

So denominator=1.214.

Which would imply that:

3 - 6 * cos gamma =1.214.

Wait, 3 -6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. Not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But if h=k=l=1, then denominator=3 -6 cos gamma.

If cos gamma is 0.866, denominator is negative, so impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using cos(180 - gamma), which is cos(150)=-0.866.

So denominator=3 -6*(-0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.495. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which gives denominator=3 +6*0.866=8.196, d≈3.495.

No match.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options provided. Since none of my calculations are matching the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But that gives a negative denominator, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, another idea: the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But perhaps in this case, despite the negative denominator, we take the absolute value of the denominator.

So d= a / sqrt( |3 -6*cos gamma| )

Which would be a/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.482≈6.756, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula without the 2 in front of the cosine terms.

But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d= a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) )

But that complicates it further.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the interplanar distance for a different plane. The options are all around 9, which is close to a=10. So perhaps the plane is (001), which in a cubic system is a/1=10. So d=10.

But the question is about (111) plane, so that's not applicable.

Wait, but the options don't include 10; option D is 10.05. Close, but not exactly 10.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using the reciprocal of the denominator without the negative sign.

So denominator is 3-6*cos gamma= -2.196. Taking absolute value, 2.196.

d=a/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.482≈6.756. No match.

Hmm.

I'm stuck, but perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula where the denominator is (h² +k² + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma.

So d=10/sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(8.196)≈3.495. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But using the absolute value of the denominator, leading to d=10/sqrt(2.196)=6.756.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which gives d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.495, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps I should consider that I'm making a mistake in the formula and that the correct approach is to use:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

And perhaps the negative denominator implies that the (111) plane is not allowed, but that's not possible because the problem provides options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which gives d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.495. Not matching.

Hmm.

I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should go with the only option that's close to a possible calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But in this case, the denominator is negative, so maybe take its absolute value.

So d=10/sqrt(2.196)=6.756.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, another thought: I recall that in some cases, when the angles are all equal, the formula simplifies, and the interplanar distance for (111) is a/(sqrt(3)*sin(gamma/2)).

Wait, let me try that.

gamma=30 degrees. sin(15)=0.2588.

So d=10/(sqrt(3)*0.2588)=10/(1.732 *0.2588)=10/(0.448)=22.32 Angstroms. Not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / (sqrt(3) sin(gamma/2)).

So d=10/(sqrt(3) *0.2588)= same as before, 22.32. Not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. Since all angles are 30 degrees, perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) is a/(sqrt(3) * cos(15 degrees)).

Wait, cos(15)=0.9659.

So d=10/(1.732 *0.9659)=10/(1.673)=5.979 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck and can't find the correct approach. Perhaps I should choose the option that results from taking the absolute value of the denominator, which is option A)9.08. But I'm not sure how that would be derived.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula as d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Even though the denominator is negative, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08. Let's compute:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2 )) = 10 / sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3 -3*sqrt(3): sqrt(3)≈1.732, so 3*1.732≈5.196. 3-5.196≈-2.196.

So denominator is sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So impossible. Hence, perhaps the correct approach is to take the magnitude, leading to d=10/sqrt(2.196)=6.756 Ang. But that's not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it's actually:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. Not possible.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and can't find the correct formula. Given the options, perhaps the answer is option A)9.08 Angstrom.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \gamma + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the given values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866)}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the denominator
The denominator becomes:

\[
\sqrt{3 - 6 \cdot 0.866} = \sqrt{3 - 5.196} = \sqrt{-2.196}
\]

This results in a negative value under the square root, which is physically impossible. This suggests that the formula may not be directly applicable or that the (111) plane is not allowed in this rhombohedral system. However, since the problem provides options, it is assumed that the plane exists and the formula is being applied correctly.

### Step 3: Reassessing the denominator
To resolve the issue, the absolute value of the denominator is considered:

\[
\text{Denominator} = \sqrt{|3 - 6 \cdot 0.866|} = \sqrt{2.196} \approx 1.482
\]

Thus, the interplanar distance is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{1.482} \approx 6.756 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The calculated value of \( d \approx 6.756 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9 Å. This discrepancy suggests that either the formula used or the interpretation of the problem may be incorrect. Given the options, the closest plausible answer based on the problem's context is **A) 9.08 Å**.

### Final Answer:
Answer: A
