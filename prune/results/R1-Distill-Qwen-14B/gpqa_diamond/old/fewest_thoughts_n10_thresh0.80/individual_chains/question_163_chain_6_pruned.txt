Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C. The question is, what is the minimum volume (in cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and what's the pH of the resulting solution?

Hmm. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so reacting it with an acid should produce a salt and water. Since it's a monobasic acid, the reaction should be straightforward. Let me write down the reaction equation.

Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid, say HCl (since it's monobasic and strong), to produce FeCl3 and water. The balanced equation would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O

Wait, is that right? Let me check the stoichiometry. Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, and each HCl provides one H+. So yeah, three HCl molecules for each Fe(OH)3.

So, first, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The given mass is 0.1 grams. Let me compute the moles of Fe(OH)3.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3's molar mass is 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me be precise: 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.0009358 mol.

From the balanced equation, each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. So the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

Wait, but the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume needed (V) is moles / concentration. So V = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. But wait, maybe I made a slight miscalculation with the molar mass.

Wait, let me calculate the molar mass more accurately. Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 / 106.869 ≈ 0.0009356 mol.

Moles of HCl needed: 3 * 0.0
