Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because they involve hydrogen bonding. A broad peak could mean either an alcohol (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid, but wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, but the peak is very broad. Wait, another thought: sometimes alcohols have broad peaks, but carboxylic acids are even broader. But the question also mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, what functional groups absorb in those regions?

The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm⁻¹ could be conjugated carbonyls, maybe an ester or a ketone with some conjugation. Oh wait, another possibility: an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an amide, but I don't think so because the options don't include nitrogen.

Looking at the 1H NMR: it shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, probably an alkene somewhere.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Now, 45 is a significant mass. Let me think: what fragments have a mass of 45? Well, CH3CO (which is 45: 12+16+16 = 44? Wait, no. Wait, let's calculate. Carbon is 12, hydrogen 1, oxygen 16.

So, CH3CO would be C2H3O2? No, wait, wait. Wait, 45 is a molecular ion that's common. Let me see: 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45? Let me calculate: 12*2 + 6 + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46? No. So that's not it. Hmm. Maybe another approach: 45 is often the m/z for a fragment like CH2=CH-O- something? Wait, no. Wait, I recall that the fragment at m/z 45 is often a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, it might be a fragment like (CH2)2O, but wait, that's 44. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3CO)+, which is CH3CO+ would be 59? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about it wrong. Another thought: the fragment at m/z 45 could be a butyraldehyde fragment, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a propiolate ion or something else. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures that fit the other data.

Now, the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the molecular formulas vary in the number of hydrogens and oxygens.

Let me think about each piece of data and see which options fit.

First, the FTIR: broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests O-H. So the molecule must have an O-H group. The other peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate carbonyl groups. Wait, but one peak is at 1700, another at 1650. Hmm. Could that be due to conjugation or different types of carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is an ester (around 1700) and another from something else. Wait, another thought: 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but then where is the carbonyl? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would lower the carbonyl stretching frequency. So maybe a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So there's a double bond. So if the molecule has both a carbonyl and a double bond, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That would explain the 1650 and 1700 cm⁻¹ peaks. For example, an enone structure (conjugated ketone and double bond). 

So the molecule is likely something like a cyclic enol ether or maybe a substituted cyclohexenone. Alternatively, maybe a substituted est
