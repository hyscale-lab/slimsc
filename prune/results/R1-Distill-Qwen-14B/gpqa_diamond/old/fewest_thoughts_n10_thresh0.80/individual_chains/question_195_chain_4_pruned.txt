Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The question is asking for the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. Oh, and both planets are in circular orbits with the same orbital plane.

Hmm. Transit and occultation events. So, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so from our view, the planet becomes hidden, leading to a slight dimming as well, but I think it's more about the planet being blocked by the star.

Wait, no, occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked. So for us to observe both events, the two planets must be aligned in such a way that their orbital periods allow them to pass in front and behind each other relative to the star.

Wait no, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. The transit is when the planet passes in front of the star. For the second planet to have a transit, it must orbit such that, from our perspective, it can pass in front of the star. Similarly, occultation would be when the second planet is behind the star, but the first planet can cause that? Or perhaps the first planet transits in front of the second? Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. The problem says the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, the second planet must sometimes pass in front of the star (transit) and sometimes be behind the star (occultation). But for that to happen, the second planet's orbit must be such that it can both pass in front of and behind the star as seen from Earth.

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the first planet affect this? Oh, wait, the question is about the second planet's maximum period. So, perhaps the two planets are in a system where their orbital periods allow for mutual transits and occultations. Or perhaps the question is about the alignment
