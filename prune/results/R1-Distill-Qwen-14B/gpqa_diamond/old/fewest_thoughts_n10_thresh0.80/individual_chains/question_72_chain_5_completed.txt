Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. Then there are a few more steps to get to product 4, and the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I think the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction because we have dienes and dienophiles. Wait, the starting material is a bicyclic diene. Oh, and the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, that's a diene too, but wait, the dienophile would have a good leaving group, maybe.

Wait, wait. Let's think. Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile, which is something with a good electron-deficient group, like a ketone, ester, or maybe an aromatic ring. Alternatively, sometimes the dienophile can be something like a carbonyl group. But in this case, the other starting material is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups attached at positions 5 and 6. So 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those is a -CH2-Br group, right? So each Br is on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but when dienophiles are involved, sometimes the other component is something like a quinone or an ester. Hmm. Alternatively, if we have two equivalents, perhaps it's a diene and a dienophile in a [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, let me think. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene structure, right? Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with a bridge. So maybe it's the diene part. Then the other molecule, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is perhaps the dienophile.

Wait, but dienophiles are usually electron-deficient. Dienes often have conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is a leaving group here. So maybe it's a diene and a dienophile undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction, but maybe the dienophile is the cyclohexadiene with the Br groups.

Wait, but then there's sodium iodide. Oh, maybe that's a Finkelstein condition — a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps. Like maybe the Br is replaced by iodide. But how does that tie into the Diels-Alder?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cycloaddition. Let me think. The bicyclo structure (norbornene) is a good diene. The other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups, which are perhaps leaving groups. Wait, but if the other molecule is cyclohexa-1,3-diene, that's a conjugated diene. So maybe it's acting as a dienophile. Hmm, but normally, the dienophile is something with a double bond that's electron-deficient, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So cyclohexadiene might not be the best dienophile. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4+4] cycloaddition? No, that's less common. Or maybe it's not a Diels-Alder but something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dienophile is the 2,5-diene part of the norbornene. No, wait, norbornene has a double bond, but the problem says it's a hepta-2,5-diene, so two double bonds. Oh wait, no, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene would have two double bonds. Wait, no, wait. The structure of norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, with two double bonds? Or just one?

Wait, no. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene is the norbornene structure, which has one double bond. Oh wait, but the compound here is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So two double bonds? Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Or perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me think. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene has two bridges, so the positions would be 1, 2, 3, etc. So positions 2 and 5 would be on different bridges. So the molecule has two double bonds? Or perhaps that's a typo, and it's a single double bond. Maybe the problem actually refers to a diene, but the numbering is such.

Wait, maybe the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornene compound is the diene, and the other is a dienophile. But the dienophile would need to be something like a dienophile with a good electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene — the cyclohexa-1,3-diene part is a conjugated diene, and each has a CH2-Br group. So perhaps the Br is a leaving group in a substitution reaction.

Wait, the reaction conditions are with sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh, that sounds like a Finkelstein reaction, where bromide is replaced by iodide. So perhaps the dienophile's Br groups are being replaced by iodide.

Wait, but the first step uses two equivalents of the dienophile. So for each dienophile molecule, perhaps two Br groups are replaced by iodide. But that might not directly lead to a Diels-Alder. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs first, then the Diels-Alder.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is a bicyclo diene. The other is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups.

Another possibility is that the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene by the dienophile in a Diels-Alder fashion. Wait, but norbornene is a strained ring, so it's a good diene for Diels-Alder reactions. So perhaps each molecule of the dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene) is attacking the norbornene in a [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, but each dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups. So when it reacts with the norbornene, perhaps each equivalent adds a cyclohexene ring to the norbornene structure.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is a bridged bicyclic compound with two substituents from the dienophile.

But this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think about each step.

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, heat. So maybe each dienophile (the cyclohexa-1,3-diene) reacts with the norbornene in a Diels-Alder reaction. But since two equivalents are used, maybe two cyclohexene rings are added to the norbornene.

Wait, but the norbornene is a bicyclo structure. Perhaps each dienophile adds across the double bonds of the norbornene, leading to a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the norbornene, and the other is the diene. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Wait, another thought: the cyclohexadiene has two Br groups on adjacent carbons (5 and 6). When treated with NaI, perhaps the Br is replaced by I, making it a diiodomethyl group. Then, perhaps the cyclohexadiene with I groups could act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the Diels-Alder reaction. The diene is conjugated, four pi electrons, and the dienophile is a two-pi-electron system. So the dienophile must have a good leaving group or be electron-deficient.

In the Diels-Alder, the dienophile is typically something like a carbonyl, or an aromatic ring. But the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with I groups might not be a great dienophile. Alternatively, perhaps the Br groups are leaving groups, and the cyclohexene becomes a diene, with the substituents being good leaving groups.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a 1,4-addition or some other type of cycloaddition. Alternatively, perhaps the Br groups are substituents that will leave in a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a [2+4] cycloaddition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps after the first step, product 1 is some kind of bridged bicyclic compound with substituents from the dienophile.

Let me think about the structures. The starting norbornene has a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, perhaps the norbornene acts as the diene, and the dienophile is one of the cyclohexadiene molecules. So the first Diels-Alder would add a cyclohexene ring to the norbornene.

But since there are two equivalents of the dienophile, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions happen, each adding a cyclohexene ring to the norbornene structure. So product 1 would be a molecule with two cyclohexene rings attached to the norbornene.

Wait, but the norbornene is a bicyclo structure, so adding two rings might give a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile adds to different positions on the norbornene.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the norbornene, and the other compound is the diene. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is the cyclohexene with Br groups, and the norbornene is the diene. Then, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring with substituents from the dienophile.

Wait, but the dienophile would typically be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, which is more like a diene rather than a dienophile. So maybe the dienophile is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br groups are leaving groups, and the dienophile is a quinone or another electron-deficient dienophile. But in this case, the other molecule is a diene, so maybe it's the diene.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The reaction is done with sodium iodide, which is a source of iodide ions. So perhaps it's a SN2 reaction, where the Br groups are replaced by iodide.

So in the first step, the dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene) reacts with sodium iodide in a substitution reaction, replacing both Br atoms with iodide. So each molecule would have two CH2-I groups.

Then, perhaps the dienophile, now with two CH2-I groups, reacts with the norbornene in a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, norbornene is a diene, which would react with a dienophile, but in this case, the dienophile (cyclohexa-diene) has iodide groups, which are not typically good dienophiles. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the iodide is a good leaving group, and another reaction occurs.

Wait, but Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. So if the dienophile has iodide groups, perhaps it's not reactive enough for Diels-Alder. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dienophile is the tert-butoxy group. No, that's an ether; probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a cyclopropane formation via a [2+2] cycloaddition, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is something else. Wait, maybe the norbornene has a substituent that can act as a dienophile. The tert-butoxy group is an ether, but perhaps the bicyclo structure itself is the diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder where the norbornene is the diene and the other molecule is the dienophile. So the dienophile would have to be a good one. But 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene isn't a typical dienophile. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the dienophile is the norbornene, and the other molecule is the diene. But norbornene isn't a great dienophile. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the 1,3-cyclohexadiene part, but that's a conjugated diene itself, which is more of a diene than a dienophile.

Wait, maybe it's not a Diels-Alder reaction. Maybe it's a ring-opening. The norbornene's double bond could open in a reaction with the dienophile.

Alternatively, maybe the substitution reaction happens first. So, the dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene) reacts with NaI to form 5,6-bis(didemethyliodide)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Then, maybe this reacts with the norbornene in a way, perhaps via some coupling.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dienophile is the norbornene, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the diiodomethyl groups. So, perhaps the dienophile is the I groups, but I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a part of the norbornene. Wait, the norbornene has a bridge, so perhaps the bridgehead is a good dienophile.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about what product 1 is. Since the question is about the final product, maybe I can think about each step in terms of functional groups and transformations.

Product 1 is formed by combining the norbornene with two equivalents of the dienophile and NaI. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4.

So, perhaps each step is a functional group transformation.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Product 1: After reaction of norbornene with dienophile and NaI.

2. Product 2: Treated with H2SO4 (aqueous). Maybe some elimination or acid-catalyzed reaction.

3. Product 3: Treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, but DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. Alternatively, SO3 could be used for sulfonation, or perhaps in a different reaction, like the Swern oxidation.

Wait, but in DMSO, SO3 might be a part of a tosyl group formation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonamide formation, but more likely, it's a sulfonation. Alternatively, when SO3 is used with pyridine in DMSO, perhaps it's involved in forming a sulfonate ester.

Wait, another reaction: when a diol is treated with SO3 in pyridine, it can form a cyclic sulfonate, which upon heating eliminates to form an epoxide. Oh, wait, that's a possibility. So, for example, if product 2 has two adjacent diols (vicinal diols), then treating with SO3 and pyridine would form a cyclic sulfonate, which upon heating would eliminate to form an epoxide.

Wait, but let's map this out.

Starting from product 1, which is the result of the initial reaction. Then, product 2 is formed by treating with aqueous sulfuric acid. Perhaps that's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening or some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. So, when treated with H2SO4, it could form some kind of cyclic structure, like an ester or another ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a diene that undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization.

Alternatively, the initial reaction could be introducing epoxide groups. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider the possibility that in the first step, the norbornene undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with the dienophile, which has Br groups. Then, in the presence of NaI, the Br groups are replaced by I.

But wait, the dienophile would have to be a good dienophile, which the cyclohexadiene may not be. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. So, the norbornene has a bridge, and the dienophile, which is a cyclohexadiene with Br groups, adds across the bridge, opening the ring.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, where the Br in the dienophile is replaced by a group from the norbornene. But that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the norbornene, and the other molecule is a diene. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures more clearly. Let me imagine the norbornene structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene is norbornene, which has two bridgehead carbons. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the structure is something like:

O
|
O-t-Bu attached to C7, with the double bonds at 2 and 5.

Wait, but the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which would have two double bonds. Oh, wait, that can't be right because that would imply a conjugated diene in a bicyclic structure, which is possible but less common.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's a monoene, like bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene or similar. But I'll proceed with the given structure.

Now, the other starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, and at positions 5 and 6, there are -CH2-Br groups.

So, perhaps the dienophile is this cyclohexadiene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile's double bonds are in positions 1 and 3, making it a conjugated diene, but perhaps the substituents (the Br groups) make it a good dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4+2] between the norbornene's diene and the dienophile's diene. But that seems unlikely because both would be dienes, not a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dienophile has a part that can act as an electron-deficient dienophile. For example, if the Br groups are good leaving groups, maybe the dienophile can form a triple bond or something else. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a Diels-Alder but a radical reaction. But that's probably not the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the later steps.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated to form product 4, and the question is about the number of distinct H atoms in product 4.

So, perhaps each step adds or modifies functional groups, leading to symmetry changes in the molecule, affecting the number of distinct H atoms.

Let me think about the possible functional groups:

After the first step, perhaps product 1 has some substituents that are diols, or perhaps it's an epoxide. Then, treating with H2SO4 could lead to ring-opening or some acid-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, but product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. That sounds like a Swern oxidation condition, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones. But wait, Swern uses oxalyl chloride and DMSO, but sometimes other conditions can be similar. Alternatively, if product 2 is a diol, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO could form a sulfonate ester, which upon heating would eliminate to form an epoxide. That's a possibility.

Wait, that rings a bell. The procedure where a diol is treated with sulfur trioxide (SO3) in pyridine, forming a cyclic sulfonate ester. Then, upon heating, the sulfonate ester eliminates to form an epoxide. So, perhaps that's the case here.

So, let's step back. If product 3 is an epoxide, then product 4 could be the result of ring-opening of the epoxide under heat. But what would cause epoxide ring-opening at 150°C? Maybe acid-catalyzed, but the earlier step was with aqueous H2SO4, which might have been an acid workup.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, leading to product 3. Then, product 3 is heated to form product 4.

If product 3 is a sulfonate ester, heating would eliminate it to form an epoxide. Then, product 4 would be an epoxide. But then, what would happen when an epoxide is heated? It might undergo ring-opening under certain conditions, perhaps in the presence of an acid or base. But the problem says it's heated at 150°C without specifying a catalyst, so maybe it's some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 isn't a sulfonate ester but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a diol, product 1. Then, product 1, upon treatment with H2SO4, forms an ester or another group, but then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine to form a sulfonate, which upon heating forms an epoxide.

Wait, but let me think about each step in order.

Step 1: norbornene + dienophile (with Br) + NaI → product 1.

Assuming that the dienophile's Br is replaced by I, but perhaps the substitution occurs first, making the dienophile diiodide. Then, Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornene.

But perhaps the Diels-Alder forms a new six-membered ring attached to the norbornene.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the iodide, and it's a diene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Diels-Alder where the norbornene is the diene, and the dienophile is the cyclohexadiene with I groups.

But I'm not clear on that. Maybe I should think about the overall structure of product 4.

If product 4 is the final product after these reactions, perhaps it's a molecule with multiple rings and substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct H atoms.

Let me try to outline each step.

Step 1: Diels-Alder reaction between norbornene and the dienophile. The dienophile has two Br groups, which upon reaction with NaI, would be replaced by I. So each dienophile molecule has two I groups.

Wait, but the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, so each molecule has two Br atoms. So with two equivalents, perhaps two dienophile molecules react with the norbornene.

Wait, perhaps each dienophile adds across the norbornene's double bonds, leading to a bridged structure with two cyclohexene rings attached.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile molecule adds a ring, leading to a product with two new rings.

Product 1 would then have two cyclohexene rings attached to the norbornene.

Then, step 2: treatment with aqueous H2SO4. Maybe this leads to a ring-opening or some acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps epoxidation or another process. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration or addition reaction.

Then, step 3: treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. As I thought earlier, this could form a sulfonate ester, which upon heating would form an epoxide.

So, product 3 would be a sulfonate ester, which upon heating (step 4) would become an epoxide, product 4.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a diol, product 1. Then, step 2 (H2SO4) forms a cyclic sulfate, product 2. Then, step 3 (SO3 and pyridine) could do something else, perhaps forming a different sulfonate, and then heating forms an epoxide.

Wait, but then product 4 would be an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps the heating in step 4 would cause the epoxide to rearrange or open, but without any acid or base, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a bridged bicyclic compound with some substituents, leading to symmetry that reduces the number of distinct H atoms.

But I'm getting stuck on the structures. Maybe I should think of a simpler approach.

Let me try to think about the possible number of distinct H atoms in product 4. The options are 4, 7, 8, 10.

If product 4 is a symmetric structure, the number of distinct H atoms would be lower. For example, a molecule with multiple equivalent Hs due to symmetry would have fewer distinct Hs.

If product 4 is a norbornene derivative with some substituents, perhaps the number of distinct Hs would be around 7 or 8.

Wait, let me think of the final product. If product 4 is a molecule with a norbornane structure (all single bonds), perhaps with some substituents, the number of distinct Hs could be 7.

Alternatively, if the final product has multiple rings and substituents, perhaps the number is higher.

But I'm not making much progress. Another approach: perhaps each step adds substituents leading to more symmetry or asymmetry.

Wait, another possibility: the first reaction is a Diels-Alder forming a new ring, product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with H2SO4, perhaps leading to epoxidation. Then, product 2 is an epoxide. Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO could form a sulfonate ester, which upon heating forms another ring structure, perhaps another epoxide or a different cyclic ether.

But perhaps the final product has a tricyclic structure with multiple substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct H atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial Diels-Alder adds two rings, making product 1 a tricyclic compound. Then, the subsequent steps modify functional groups, leading to product 4 with several substituents, possibly leading to a higher number of distinct Hs.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about each step again.

Step 1: Diels-Alder between norbornene and dienophile. The dienophile has two Br groups. With NaI, perhaps the Br is replaced by I. Then the dienophile becomes diiodomethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Then, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring. So, each dienophile adds to the norbornene, perhaps leading to a bridged structure.

Wait, but with two equivalents, perhaps two dienophiles add to the norbornene, leading to a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile adds to a different face of the norbornene, leading to a symmetrical product.

If product 1 is a symmetrical molecule, perhaps product 2 would have some symmetry.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. If product 2 is a diol, then product 3 would be a sulfonate ester, which upon heating gives an epoxide.

Product 4 would then be an epoxide. The number of distinct Hs in an epoxide depends on the structure. For example, in a simple epoxide like ethylene oxide, there's only one type of H. But in a more complex structure, it could have more.

But I'm not getting closer. Maybe I should look at the options and think about which makes sense.

The options are 4,7,8,10.

If product 4 is a highly symmetrical molecule, like a norbornane with some substituents, perhaps it has 7 distinct Hs.

Alternatively, if it's less symmetrical, maybe more.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornane derivative with two substituents. Let's say, for example, that each addition in the Diels-Alder brings in a substituent, leading to a molecule that has symmetry, reducing the number of distinct Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has multiple rings and substituents, leading to more distinct Hs.

Another approach: think about the number of distinct Hs in the starting material, norbornene.

Norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene) has a bridge, so the Hs on the bridgehead carbons are equivalent. But when functional groups are added, the symmetry could change.

In the starting material, the Hs on the bridge are in equivalent positions, so it has fewer distinct Hs. Then, after adding substituents, perhaps the number increases or decreases.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should look for the answer elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a decalin structure, which is bicyclo[4.4.0]decane. Decalin has two bridgehead Hs, and depending on the substituents, the number of distinct Hs can vary.

If product 4 is decalin with some substituents, perhaps it has 8 distinct Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically, leading to fewer.

Wait, another angle: the number of distinct Hs in the final product is 7. That would correspond to option D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 7, so the answer is D.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, followed by treatments with sodium iodide, aqueous sulfuric acid, SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO, and finally heating at 150°C. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Step 1**: The reaction between the norbornene derivative and the dienophile likely involves a Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, reacts with the norbornene. Sodium iodide may facilitate substitution of bromine with iodine, but the exact mechanism of this step is unclear. The result is product 1, which likely incorporates the dienophile into the norbornene structure.

2. **Step 2**: Treatment of product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) could lead to acid-catalyzed reactions, such as ring-opening or functional group transformations. This step likely modifies the structure further, forming product 2.

3. **Step 3**: Reaction of product 2 with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO suggests the formation of a sulfonate ester or a related intermediate. This step could prepare the molecule for elimination or rearrangement, leading to product 3.

4. **Step 4**: Heating product 3 at 150°C likely induces a structural change, such as elimination or rearrangement, resulting in the final product, product 4.

5. **Final Product**: The exact structure of product 4 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred to be a complex bicyclic or tricyclic compound with multiple substituents. The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms depends on the symmetry and substituents of the final structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reaction sequence and the options provided, the final product is likely a molecule with **7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**. This corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**
