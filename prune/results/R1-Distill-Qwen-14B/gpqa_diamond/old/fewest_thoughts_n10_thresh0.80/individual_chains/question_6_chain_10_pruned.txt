Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I remember that in such cases, the potential might be separable into radial and angular parts, which would allow us to solve the problem using polar coordinates.

Wait, right. In two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation is often solved using polar coordinates because of the symmetry. So the potential here has two terms: one is purely radial, (1/2)kr², and the other is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The second term depends on the angle θ, so maybe I can separate the variables.

So, let me think about the form of the potential. V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor kr²/2 from both terms: that would give V(r,θ) = (kr²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, wait, no. Wait, (1/2)kr² is the first term, and (3/2)kr² cos²θ is the second. So the total is (kr²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Wait, no, because 1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ. So that's V(r,θ) = (kr²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as V(r) + V(θ), where V(r) is (1/2)kr² and V(θ) is (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Wait, but actually, when I write the Hamiltonian, it's the kinetic energy plus the potential. So the kinetic part in polar coordinates is (ħ²/(2m))[ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) ) + (1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) ) ] plus the potential V(r,θ). So the idea is to see if the potential can be written as a sum of functions that depend on r and θ separately. Because if the potential doesn't separate, the problem might be more complicated. But in this case, the potential does depend on both r and θ, but perhaps we can separate variables.

Wait, actually, the potential is already written as a function of r and θ, but I'm not sure if it's separable. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So that's (kr²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, so the potential is proportional to r² times a function of θ. So the potential can be written as r² multiplied by some function of θ. So perhaps we can separate the variables into r and θ parts.

Wait, in the Schrödinger equation, the potential is part of the equation, so if it's multiplied by r², and the other terms involve derivatives with respect to r and θ, perhaps we can find a way to separate the variables. Let me think about the eigenfunctions. If the potential has a term proportional to cos²θ, maybe it's better to express it in terms of cos(2θ), using a trigonometric identity. Because cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me try that.

So, cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So the V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me compute that. The second term would be (3k r² / 4)(1 + cos 2θ). So adding the first term (1/2 kr²), the potential becomes [ (1/2) + (3/4) ]kr² + (3/4)kr² cos 2θ.
