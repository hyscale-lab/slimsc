Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says the operator is P with components P_x, P_y, P_z. They give each component as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along a direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, right, so the operator P is a vector operator, and the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So n could be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Because in x-z plane, the angle θ is between the x-axis and the projection in x-z.

The operator we're looking at is the projection of P along n. Oh wait, no, wait. The operator is P, and the eigenvalue is along direction n. So the operator for the component along n would be P·n̂. Because the eigenvalue corresponds to the component along that direction.

So to find the eigenvector, I need to find the eigenstate of P·n̂ with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me think. The operator P·n̂ is given by the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction. So:

P·n̂ = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z.

But wait, n lies in the x-z plane, so n
