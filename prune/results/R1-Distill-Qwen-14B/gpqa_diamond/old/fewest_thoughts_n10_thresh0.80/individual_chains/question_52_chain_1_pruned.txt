Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh, right, when stars have spots, it changes their overall temperature, which in turn affects the behavior of the atoms in their photosphere.

Alright, let's break down the given information. The star normally has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 K when there are no dark spots. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but the spots themselves must be cooler, right? Because dark spots on a star are regions with lower temperature, so they emit less light. But the question says the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases overall. I think that's because the spots are part of the photosphere, so the average temperature goes down when spots cover part of the surface.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. So, when the star has spots, this ratio changes, and we need to find the factor by which it changes. The ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2, respectively. The problem says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the question is, how much does it change? The options are numbers like 1.1, 7.8, etc.

Wait, the ratio is in the context of the Saha equation, I think. The Saha equation describes the ionization states of atoms in stellar atmospheres and also deals with the populations of different energy levels. The equation is:

n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * ( (2π m_e k T)^(3/2) / h^3 ) * e^(-χ/(kT)) ) * (1/(n_e))

Wait, but wait, when considering two energy levels of the same element, like neutral Ti, the ratio of their populations is given by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, because if the atom is neutral, and we're just talking about different energy levels within the same ionization state, then the Saha equation isn't about ionization but about excitation. So maybe it's the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation for two energy levels is:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Where g2 and g1 are the degeneracies of the levels, E2 and E1 are their energies, and T is the effective temperature.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Let me see. So normally, without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, so T1 = 6000 K. When it has spots, the overall T is 5500 K, so T2 =5500 K. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, but the rest of the photosphere is at 6000 K. Hmm, but the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the assumption is that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Or does it? Or maybe the effective temperature is a weighted average because part of the surface is cooler. Wait, no, the effective temperature is the overall observed temperature, which is a blackbody emission weighted by the areas. But the photosphere's temperature is a combination of the spotted and non-spotted regions.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So I think that the photosphere as a whole is considered to be at 5500 K when the spots are present, because the star's overall Teff is 5500
