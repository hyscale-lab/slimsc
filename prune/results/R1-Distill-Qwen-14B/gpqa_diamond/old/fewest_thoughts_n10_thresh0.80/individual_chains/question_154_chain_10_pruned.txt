Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. Hmm, I've got to analyze the given information and match it to the options provided.

First, looking at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's also a peak at 158, which is 32%. The molecular weight is 156, so the molecular formula must have a molecular weight around that. Let me think about what that could be. The additional 2 mass units could be a chlorine isotope or perhaps something else, but wait, 158 is 2 more than 156. Hmm, chlorine usually has a mass of about 35.5, so maybe the molecule has a Cl atom. Alternatively, maybe an oxygen is involved, but that might not add up. Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion is the M+2 peak of another element. Let me think, the M and M+2 could suggest a Cl in the molecule. Because chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and 25% for 37Cl. So the ratio between the molecular ion and the M+2 peak can indicate the presence of Cl. The molecular ion is 100%, and M+2 is 32%. Let's calculate the ratio. 32% is about 32/100= 0.32. If the formula includes Cl, then the ratio of M to M+2 should be (35Cl)/(37Cl). The ratio of the peaks would be based on the natural abundance. The molecular ion (M) would correspond to 35Cl, and the M+2 would be 37Cl. So the ratio of M to M+2 is (0.75)/(0.25) = 3:1. Wait, but here M is 156 (100%), and M+2 is 32%. So that's 100% to 32%, which is about 3.125:1. Hmm, that's close to 3:1. So that suggests one Cl atom in the molecule. So the molecular formula might have a Cl.

Next, looking at the IR data. The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretching. That can come from either an alcohol, phenol, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300, but they can be very broad, sometimes encompassing a wider range. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an acid chloride. But let's think: a peak at 1720 is a bit high for an aldehyde (which is around 1720-1750 maybe), but ketones are around 1700-1750. Carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl peaks, like ~1700 maybe, but sometimes lower. Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, phenyl chloroformate has a carbonyl, but that's an ester. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a singlet, possibly from an O-H proton in a carboxylic acid, or maybe an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but sometimes up to 10.5. But 11 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid O-H would be around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak, but wait, it's a singlet here. Wait, carboxylic acid O-H is usually a broad peak, right? But in the NMR, it's a singlet. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. 11 is a bit higher. Another possibility is that it's an aromatic aldehyde with strong electron-withdrawing groups, which could shift the aldehyde proton upfield or downfield. Wait, maybe the aldehyde is in the para position to an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the proton, making it appear at a higher ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that deshield the proton.

Then, the other peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These are in the aromatic region. The doublets suggest that each set of protons is coupled to another set. So, perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split into doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons on adjacent carbons would be equivalent, leading to two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So that's consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has a benzene ring (because the aromatic protons are in the ~8 ppm range) with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but looking at the substituents. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro
