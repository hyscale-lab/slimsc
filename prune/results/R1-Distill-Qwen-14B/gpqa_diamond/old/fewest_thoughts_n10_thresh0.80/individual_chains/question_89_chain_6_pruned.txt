Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem carefully.

The question involves several reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, first, it's heated with KOH. Then, the product is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. After that, ozone is bubbled through the solution at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me break it down step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But wait, this is 1,3-dibromo, which is not vicinal. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of adamantane. So the structure is adamantane with two Brs on positions 1 and 3. So when KOH is used, perhaps elimination occurs, but wait, the positions might be such that when Brs are on 1 and 3, could they form a double bond?

Wait, in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, so the positions 1 and 3 are probably on adjacent carbons? Or are they opposite? Hmm, not entirely sure about the structure. Wait, but perhaps the initial step is a dehydrohalogenation. Okay, so if we have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between them. But if it's 1 and 3, maybe it's not adjacent. Wait, no, in adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three others. Let me think: for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the two Brs are on carbons that are not adjacent. Hmm, but elimination typically requires adjacent leaving groups. So perhaps the structure can't eliminate to form a double bond, but maybe something else happens.

Wait, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation but in a
