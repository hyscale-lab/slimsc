Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because only one hemisphere has these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness changes as the spots come into and go out of view. This makes the light curve vary periodically. The question is saying that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the brightness variations. But the twist is, if the star wasn't covered in spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve? We need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm. So essentially, the star's brightness variation due to the spots is being mistaken for the transit of an exoplanet. We need to find the exoplanet's radius that would cause the same dip in brightness.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star. So the fractional change in brightness is the square of the ratio of their radii.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't completely uniform. Part of its surface is cooler, so when the spots rotate into view, they make the star appear dimmer. So the change in brightness isn't just from a solid black circle (like a planet), but from a spotted surface.

The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so maybe that's 50% of the surface? No, wait, the filling factor is given as 20% for the spots. So the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. Oh, but wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So perhaps the spots are only on one hemisphere, which is half the star. But the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere? Or does the filling factor refer to 20% of the entire star?

Wait, the question says: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the total area covered by spots is 20% of one hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star, the total area of spots would be 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) = 0.1 π R². Wait, no, let me think again.

The entire surface area of a sphere is 4π R². So one hemisphere is 2π R². So the spots cover 20% (0.2) of that hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but how does that affect the overall brightness?
