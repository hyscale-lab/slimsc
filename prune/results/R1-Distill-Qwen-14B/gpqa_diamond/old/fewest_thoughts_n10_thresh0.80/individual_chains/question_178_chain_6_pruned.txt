Okay, so I have this Lagrangian given, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Wait, right, the gamma matrices' commutator.

First, I should find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian to figure out what κ's dimension must be. Remember, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x (which has dimension -4) requires the Lagrangian to be dimensionless? Wait, no. Wait, the action S is dimensionless because it's in the exponential of the path integral. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density, so S = ∫ L d^4x. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 because d^4x has dimension [Energy]^4 (since each x is inverse energy, so x^4 is [Energy]^-4). So when you multiply L (dimension 4) by d^4x, you get a dimensionless action.

Wait no, wait: The Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Energy]^4. Because when you integrate L over spacetime, which has dimensions [Energy]^-4 (since each x has dimension [Energy]^-1), the integral gives dimensionless action. So L must have [Energy]^4.

So each term in L must have [Energy]^4. Let's look at the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each of these fields has a certain mass dimension. Let's recall the standard dimensions in 4D spacetime.

The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the equation of motion is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. The term iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have the same dimension as mψ. So mψ has dimension (mass) + (dim ψ). The derivative acting on ψ gives (dim ψ) + 1. So equating: (dim ψ) +1 = (dim ψ) + mass dimension. Hmm, wait, perhaps another approach. The field ψ has dimension 3/2. Because the kinetic term in the Lagrangian is something like ∫ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ d^4x. Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) + (1) = 5? Wait, no, because each ψ is 3/2, so two ψ's make 3. The derivative adds 1, so 3+1=4. Which matches the Lagrangian's dimension of 4.
