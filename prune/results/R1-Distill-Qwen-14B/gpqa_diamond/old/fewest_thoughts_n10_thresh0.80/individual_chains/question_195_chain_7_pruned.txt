Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is about two planets around a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. The question is about the maximum orbital period a second planet can have, which has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. This second planet should also exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane, and their orbits are circular.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that for a planet to transit its star from our point of view, its orbital plane must be aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of stellar radii) from the center of the star that the planet's path comes closest. An impact parameter of zero would mean it's right down the center, but a higher value means it's a bit off.

Transit and occultation events—occultation is when the planet is behind the star from our perspective. So both events require the planet to pass in front and behind the star, meaning the orbital planes are edge-on, right? So both planets must be in the same orbital plane, which is edge-on relative to us.

Wait, but the first planet is already transiting, so its orbital plane is edge-on. The second planet must also be in this same plane, so it can also transit and occult. But the question is about the maximum period the second planet can have.

I think the key here is about orbital periods and orbital distances. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, their orbital periods are related to their orbital radii via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law in the case of a star as the central body states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius (a). Mathematically, P² ∝ a³. But because the star here isn't the Sun, we need to account for its mass. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the mass of the star, which is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, the star's radius is given, but we don't have its mass. Hmm. Well, unless we can assume it's similar to the Sun, but that's an assumption. Wait, but in the absence of mass information, perhaps the problem expects us to use the same star for both planets, and maybe the star's mass isn't needed because we'll be comparing the two planets.

Wait, if we consider that Kepler's third law for the same star can be written as (P₁/P₂)² = (a₁/a₂)³. But wait, is that correct? Actually, the formula is (P²)/(a³) is the same for all planets around the same star. So P₁² / a₁³ = P₂² / a₂³.

But wait, I might be mixing up the exact formula. Let me think: Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. So for the same star, the ratio (P₁²)/(a₁³) = (P₂²)/(a₂³). So the formula would be P₂ = P₁ * (a₂/a₁)^(3/2).

But I don't know a₁ or a₂ yet. So perhaps I need to find the ratio of the two planets' orbital radii based on their transit conditions.

Wait, but how does the transit impact parameter relate to the orbital radius? The impact parameter (b) is given by b = a * sin(i), where i is the inclination of the orbit. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, their inclinations are the same, and for a transit to occur, it must be close to 90 degrees (edge-on). So in this case, i is 90 degrees, so sin(i) is 1. So b = a.

Wait, no, wait. The impact parameter
