Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's see what I remember.

The question says a charge q is placed at a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with a different formula.

Wait, so first, I should recall what happens when a charge is placed near a grounded conductor. I remember that grounding means the conductor is connected to the earth, which is at zero potential. So any excess charge on the conductor can flow to the ground. But in this case, the sphere is conducting, so maybe the charge q induces charges on the sphere.

Oh right, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's free electrons (since it's a conductor) will redistribute. So the charge q induces an opposite charge on the near side of the sphere and a same charge on the far side. But wait, the sphere is grounded, which complicates things because the induced charges can leave the sphere.

Wait, no. Wait, if the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would be neutralized by the ground. So when you bring a charge q near a conducting sphere that's grounded, the induced charges on the sphere would cause the sphere to have a charge, but since it's grounded, it can't hold that charge. Hmm, no, maybe that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, grounding allows charges to flow in or out. So when
