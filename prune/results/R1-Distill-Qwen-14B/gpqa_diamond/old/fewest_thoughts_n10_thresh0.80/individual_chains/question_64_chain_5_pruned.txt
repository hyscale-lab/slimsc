Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again and see what's going on.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, totaling 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases formed. These gases were then passed through three tubes: the first with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 grams.
- Tube 3's weight increased by 0.80 grams (and CuO formed there).
- Tube 2's weight didn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are given as A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the setup. Heating salts A and B in an inert atmosphere (no air) leads to the production of gases. These gases pass through the tubes, and the changes in each tube give us clues about the gases present.

Let me think about each tube:

1. **Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2.** This is a drying agent. If it gained weight, it must have absorbed some water vapor, because Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant. So the gas that reacted here is probably water vapor, H2O. The increase in weight was 3.60 grams. So that's the mass of H2O absorbed. 

Wait, but when Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So the increase corresponds to the mass of water captured. So, 3.60 grams of H2O.

2. **Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution.** The mass didn't change. That suggests that no gas reacted here. Because if a gas like CO2 or SO2 were present, it would react with the solution and cause a change. Alternatively, maybe the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Hmm. What gases don't react with Ca(OH)2? Well, CO2 would react to form CaCO3, which would increase the mass. But in this case, the mass didn't change, so perhaps the gas didn't react. Maybe it was a neutral gas like N2 or something else inert.

Wait, but the problem says only a mixture of gases was formed. So what could the gases be?

3. **Tube 3: Red-hot copper.** The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So, the gas that reacted here must be a reducing agent, like CO or H2, which can reduce CuO (but wait, Cu is already in a high-temperature environment, so perhaps the gas is oxidizing it? No, wait. When copper is red-hot, it's in a reactive state. If a gas like CO or H2 is passed over hot Cu, it would react. Let me think: CO reacting with Cu would form CuO and CO2. H2 would react with Cu to form CuO and H2O. Or perhaps, it's something else like NH3, but I don't think so.

Wait, but the problem states that CuO is formed in tube 3. So, the gas is probably H2, because H2 can reduce CuO to Cu, but wait, if the copper is red-hot, maybe the reaction is the reverse. Wait, no. Maybe the copper is in a form that when a gas passes through, it reacts. Maybe the gas is CO, which would react with the copper.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like H2, which could react with Cu at high temperatures. Let me think about the reactions.

If the gas is H2, then when it reacts with hot Cu, it may not do anything because H2 is a reducing agent, but under certain conditions, maybe it doesn't react. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is CO, which could react with Cu. Or maybe the gas is a sulfide, but I don't know.

But considering the reaction in tube 3, the mass increase is 0.80 grams. Let's calculate what that could be. Suppose the gas is CO. The reaction would be:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (some reaction like that, maybe not exact stoichiometry). Alternatively, perhaps it's H2:

H2 + Cu → no reaction unless under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is NH3, but that seems unlikely because NH3 is a weak reducing agent and might not react at such high temperatures.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the gases that could pass through each tube.

From tube 1, we
