Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me read the question again.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Alright, first, I need to figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. So, initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles. So the concentration should decrease because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. But wait, the units are in cm³, so I need to convert to liters for molarity. Wait, no, the formula is moles = Molarity × Volume in liters. Or wait, wait. 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So, moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Right.

After dilution with 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume. Moles are 0.001, volume 0.04 L. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the new concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. So, the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles, right? Wait wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, we need to add 0.001 moles of NaOH.

But wait, the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So when 25% of this volume is added, that's 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, let me clarify. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the total volume of NaOH needed is 10 cm³. So 25% titration would mean adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the equivalence point first.

Wait, but the problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So I need to find two pH values.

Let's first tackle the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So the solution will contain sodium acetate (a salt of a weak acid and strong base). So the solution will be basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, and it will hydrolyze in water.

So, for the equivalence point:

The moles of NaOH added are equal to the moles of acetic acid initially present. So as I calculated, 0.001
