Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant disease resistance and gene knockouts. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The question is about white lupine and its resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3, and made knockouts (mutants) for each. They also made double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The idea is to figure out how these genes interact based on the resistance levels of the mutants.

The setup tells me that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor that acts upstream of another gene. So, one gene is regulating others. Transcription factors usually activate or repress other genes, so their function is kind of like a switch.

The results are resistance levels compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%. The mutants' resistances are as follows:

- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild-type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. I remember that in genetic interactions, the way the double mutants behave compared to single mutants can tell us a lot. For example, if a double mutant is more severe than either single mutant, it could indicate certain types of interactions.

Let me think about each gene. Starting with g2. Its resistance is 0%, which is the most severe. Both double mutants that include g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also have 0% resistance. That suggests that when g2 is knocked out, the resistance is completely lost, regardless of the other gene's status. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's essential for the resistance pathway. Because without G2, even if another gene is present, it can't contribute—so G2 is upstream, perhaps regulating both G1 and G3.

Looking at G1: the single mutant has 75% resistance. So it's less resistant but not completely susceptible. The double mutants with G1 and another gene (g1g2 and g1g3) have 0% and 10% respectively. Wait, but g1g2 is 0%, which is the same as g2. But g1g3 is even worse—10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone.

Wait, but that might not make sense. Let me think again. If G2 is a transcription factor, then G1 and G3 might be downstream of G2. So G2's product is necessary for the function of G1 and G3.

In the case where g2 is knocked out, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't function because they're not being activated. So in the g2 mutant, the resistance is zero, which makes sense because the transcription factor isn't activating anything downstream.

Now, for the single mutants: G1's mutant (g1) is 75% resistance. So without G1, the plant is 75% as resistant as wild-type. That suggests that G1 contributes to resistance but isn't absolutely essential—maybe it's part of a redundant system or that it's not the only gene downstream of G2.

G3's mutant (g3) is 50%, so without G3, the plant is half as resistant. So G3 also contributes but perhaps less so than G1.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. Well, since g2 is already 0%, adding g1 doesn't change that. So that doesn't tell me much beyond what I know about g2.

g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 are additive or perhaps have a synergistic effect when both are present. Wait, no. If knocking out both makes it worse, maybe they're in parallel pathways. So G1 and G3 are separate downstream genes of G2, and both contribute to resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further.

Wait, but g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So when both are knocked out, it's 10%, which is worse than either. That suggests that their functions are additive or that they have overlapping functions. Alternatively, perhaps one is upstream of the other, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, since g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive. But 75% + 50% isn't 10%—maybe I should think in terms of epistasis.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of aa or A_ is the same, meaning gene A is downstream of B.

So, looking at the data, when G2 is knocked out (g2), all resistance is lost. So G2 must be upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 is a transcription factor, as suggested in the question.

Now, looking at G1 and G3. The single mutants have 75% (G1) and 50% (G3) resistance. So both contribute to resistance, but G1 more so.

In double mutants not involving G2, like g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops much more. That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in parallel pathways, and their combined loss leads to a severe phenotype.

Wait, but another way to look at it: if G2 activates both G1 and G3, then when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So both are non-functional, which leads to 0% resistance.

But when only G1 is knocked out, G3 is still active, so the plant has some resistance (75% for g1). Wait, no, wait: g1 is 75%, which is less than wild-type. So
