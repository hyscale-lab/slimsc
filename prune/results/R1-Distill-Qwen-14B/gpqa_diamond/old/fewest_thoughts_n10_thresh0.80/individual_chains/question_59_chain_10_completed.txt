Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are given as A to D.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out if there's excess acid or base after the reaction. If there's excess, I can calculate the pH based on that; if they completely neutralize, maybe the solution is neutral or something else.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each acid and base. Moles are moles = concentration (M) × volume (L).

For CH3COOH:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M.
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for the neutralization step, I think I can consider it as a strong acid in terms of moles of H+ it can provide because the reaction with base would proceed based on H+ availability.

Wait, but wait. When mixing with a base, the H+ from both acids (HCl and CH3COOH) would react with the hydroxide ions from Ba(OH)2.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Each HCl gives 1 H+ and 1 Cl-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit releases 2 OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So, let's calculate the moles of each.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. It will donate H+ (but since it's weak, maybe not all, but in the initial neutralization, let's treat it as contributing 0.05 mol H+).

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol. Since HCl is strong, it will fully dissociate into 0.08 mol H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So, the H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. Let's add those together.

Total H+ = 0.05 (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (from HCl) = 0.13 mol.

Total OH- is 0.18 mol.

Now, when H+ and OH- react, they neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So the OH- will neutralize some H+.

The OH- is 0.18 mol, H+ is 0.13 mol.

So, OH- will consume all the H+ and have some left over. How much?

0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol of OH- remaining.

So, after neutralization, we have excess OH-. That means the solution is basic, so pH will be above 7.

Now, I need to find the concentration of this excess OH-.

First, find the total volume of the solution. The volumes are 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

The excess OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L. So concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = approximately 0.041666... M.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the math.

0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L: yeah, that's 0.05 /1.2 = 0.041666... which is around 0.0417 M.

Then, to find pH, I can first find pOH and then convert to pH.

pOH = -log10 [OH-] = -log(0.041666...)

Calculating that: log(0.041666). Let's think.

Log(4.1666e-2) is log(4.1666) + log(1e-2) → log(4.1666) is about 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381. So pOH is -(-1.381) = 1.381.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.381 = 12.619. So approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.

But wait, wait again. Did I consider everything correctly? Because acetic acid is a weak acid; when H+ is neutralized by OH-, does that affect anything else? Hmm.

Wait, in the neutralization, the OH- will first react with the strong acid (HCl) because it's stronger, and any remaining will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). But in our calculation, the OH- is in excess after neutralizing all H+ from both acids. So I think the initial approach is correct. The H+ from both acids is neutralized by OH-, and anything left over gives the basic solution.

Another point: when OH- is in excess, the solution is basic, so the pH is determined by the concentration of OH-.

So the steps seem correct. So the answer should be A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we calculate the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by the acids and bases, respectively, and then analyze the excess after neutralization.

1. **Moles of H⁺ from acids**:
   - Acetic acid (CH₃COOH):  
     Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, it contributes 0.05 mol of H⁺.
   - Hydrochloric acid (HCl):  
     Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates, contributing 0.08 mol of H⁺.
   - **Total H⁺** = \( 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Moles of OH⁻ from base**:
   - Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂):  
     Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 OH⁻ ions, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Neutralization reaction**:
   - H⁺ and OH⁻ react in a 1:1 ratio:  
     \( 0.13 \, \text{mol H⁺} + 0.18 \, \text{mol OH⁻} = 0.13 \, \text{mol H₂O} + 0.05 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).  
     After neutralization, there is an excess of \( 0.05 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

4. **Concentration of excess OH⁻**:
   - Total solution volume = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0417 \, \text{M} \).

5. **pH calculation**:
   - pOH = \( -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \).  
   - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Since the solution is basic due to the excess OH⁻, the pH is determined by the concentration of OH⁻. The calculated pH is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to option A.
