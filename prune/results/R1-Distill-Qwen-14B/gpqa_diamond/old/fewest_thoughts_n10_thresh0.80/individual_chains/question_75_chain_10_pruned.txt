Okay, so I've got this question about a mouse model study involving GADD45G protein and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hmm, let's try to work through this step by step.

The scenario is that the researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed in an inducible manner. They want to see if this protein plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To do this, they modified the gene to include a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. Then they transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the problem, the key issue is why the protein isn't being overexpressed. The options given are A to D, each suggesting a different reason.

The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand. To understand what's going on, maybe I should look for possible issues in the coding sequence that would prevent proper expression.

First, let's think about the setup. They added the HA tag at the N-terminus. So, the first part of the sequence should code for the HA tag, followed by GADD45G. Let's examine the sequence.

Looking at the start, the first few codons after the ATG start would be the HA tag. Wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence, right? The HA peptide is typically YPYDVPDYA, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is just a short peptide, perhaps derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. But perhaps the exact amino acid sequence isn't critical here.

Wait, but in the DNA sequence provided, after the ATG start codon, what does the sequence say? Let me parse the first part.

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCATACG ATG T TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT C... Hmm, wait, no, perhaps I should break it down into codons. Let me do that.

ATG is the start
