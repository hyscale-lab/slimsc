Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that potentials can sometimes be expressed in terms of angular parts and radial parts, which might help in solving the problem.

Wait, so in two dimensions, the particle is moving, and the potential has both r and θ dependence. I think I should try to separate the variables or see if this potential can be rewritten in a way that makes the problem more manageable.

Looking at V(r, θ): it's (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out the kr² term. So that gives kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this expression further. Alternatively, maybe I can express this in terms of a polar coordinate system, but in two dimensions, the separation of variables is a bit different than in three dimensions. Oh wait, but for two-dimensional problems, especially in polar coordinates, the Schrödinger equation can sometimes be solved by separating into radial and angular parts.

Wait, what about the potential's form? The first term is like a harmonic oscillator in r (since it's proportional to r squared), and the second term is proportional to r squared times cos squared theta. Cos^2 theta can be written using a double-angle identity, right? Like cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² [ (1 + cos(2θ) ) / 2 ].

Calculating that, let's see: (1/2) kr² is the first part. The second part is (3/2) * kr² * [ (1+cos2θ)/2 ] = (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). Adding them together: the constant terms are (1/2 + 3/4) kr², which is (5/4) kr². And the varying term is (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

So the potential becomes V(r, θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos(2θ). Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Maybe that's not the right approach. Another thought: perhaps the potential can be rewritten as something like a sum of harmonic oscillators in different directions.

In two dimensions, sometimes you can express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let's switch to Cartesian coordinates to see if that helps. Remember that r² is x² + y². And cos²θ is (x²)/(r²) because cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²).

So substituting into the potential, V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (x²/(x² + y²)).

Hmm, that might not look much better. Wait, let's compute it. Let me write it as
