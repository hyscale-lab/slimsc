Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through each part carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, but the main parts are about tautomerism and optical isomerism. I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift of a double bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. Optical isomerism, on the other hand, occurs when a molecule has chirality, meaning it has a non-superimposable mirror image. Chiral centers are crucial for this.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism?

Hmm, I need to figure out if these compounds can undergo tautomerism. Let's start with benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, actually, benzoquinone can be either para-quinone or ortho-quinone, depending on the structure. Quinones generally have two ketone groups opposite each other. Since the structure is symmetrical, does that affect tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism usually requires a conjugated system with adjacent double bonds or lone pairs. For instance, in a diketone like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, there's a possibility for keto-enol tautomerism because the hydrogen can shift from one ketone oxygen to the adjacent carbonyl. But what about a compound with three ketone groups?

Wait, no, looking at the given options, part A is about benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. The cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, each at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, it's a hexagonal ring with three O double bonds attached in a symmetrical fashion.

Now, can either of these undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism (like keto-enol) requires the possibility of a hydrogen moving, which usually involves a conjugated system where the hydrogen can shift between adjacent atoms. Let me think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: Structure is O=C6H4=O. Since the two ketone groups are opposite each other, there's no adjacent hydrogen on the benzene ring. Wait, no, the benzene ring itself doesn't have hydrogens attached where the oxygen is. So, the quinone structure is a conjugated di-ketone. But wait, can it undergo any tautomerism? I think benzoquinone generally doesn't have any acidic protons that can lose a hydrogen to form an enol
