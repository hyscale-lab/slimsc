Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid that contains a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR spectra: a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in 13C NMR. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3. The NOESY NMR of the major product has a cross-peak, which is missing in the minor product. The question is about identifying which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, the starting material: a cis-diacid. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride depends on the starting diacid. Since the diacid has a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride with a double bond. But wait, dehydration of a diacid usually involves losing a water molecule from each -COOH group, forming two acid anhydride groups. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a cyclic anhydride if the acid has two carboxylic groups adjacent or near each other.

But in this case, since the diacid has a cis-alkene, perhaps the dehydration leads to an anhydride with a conjugated double bond. The NMR data of the anhydride tells us more. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons appear, but wait, our compound is an anhydride, not aromatic. Alternatively, 7 ppm could be vinyl protons. But if the anhydride has a double bond, the protons adjacent might be around that region.

Wait, but the
