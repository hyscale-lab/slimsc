Okay, so I have this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

The question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here because the question is about elemental abundances. Maybe the masses are a red herring, or maybe they come into play somehow, but I'll think about it later.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm not too familiar with that. Oh well, the key is the abundance ratios provided. Let's list them out.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the element's number density relative to the Sun.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and similarly for Mg. Let me parse that.

So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12? Wait, no. Wait, the way it's written is 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ?

Wait, but wait: the notation is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The standard way is that [X/H] is log10(n_X / n_H) - log10(n_X / n_H)_sun. Wait, no. Wait, the [X/Y] notation is relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X^sun / n_Y^sun).

But in the question, for the Sun, it's given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So that would mean log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 1e-4.5. Similarly for Mg.

But wait, is that the correct way to interpret it? Because I think the notation is sometimes written as 12 + log10(n_X / H) = value. Or perhaps it's the other way around. H is hydrogen, so n_X is the number density of element X, n_H is the number density of hydrogen.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log(nMg/nH) is 7.5 -12? Wait no. Wait, the Sun's nMg/nH is given as 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. So nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me just note down the Sun's values.

Sun:
log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5)

So, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0. So [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0. Which means log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 =1e-4.5.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi^sun/nFe^sun). Wait, no, because [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X^sun / n_Y^sun). So [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Wait, but for the Sun, nFe_sun /nH_sun is 1e-4.5, and nSi_sun /nH_sun? Hmm, I don't have that value given. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Si/H] and [Fe/H], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the abundances for each star relative to the Sun.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0. So [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Which we already knew: nFe1/nH1 =1e-4.5.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. Which is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

Let me denote the Sun's nSi/nFe as (nSi_sun)/(nFe_sun) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

Which would be [ (nSi/nH)_sun ] / [ (nFe/nH)_sun ].

Wait, from the Sun's data, (nFe/nH)_sun = 1e-4.5, and (nMg/nH)_sun =1e-5.

But I don't have (nSi/nH)_sun given. Hmm, that's a problem because I can't compute nSi_sun/nFe_sun without knowing nSi_sun. Unless I can get it from the data provided.

Wait, perhaps I can get [Mg/Si]_2, which is given for Star_2. But not for Star_1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps considering that in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] ratio is a certain value, but the question doesn't provide that. I'm stuck here.

Wait, maybe I can express [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of their respective ratios to hydrogen and then find the overall [Si] ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate [Si/H] for each star and then take their ratio.

Wait, let's see. For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means [Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nFe/nH in Star_1 equals that in the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

Which can be rewritten as log(nSi1) - log(nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun) - log(nFe_sun).

But since nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun, if I let nFe_sun = Fe_sun, nH_sun = H_sun, then nFe1 = (Fe_sun/H_sun) * H1.

Wait, because nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, nH1 is the number density of hydrogen in Star_1. But perhaps the total number density isn't important, since we're dealing with ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/H]_1.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

But nFe1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H1.

Similarly, nSi1 = (Si_sun / H_sun) * H1 * 10^{[Si/Fe]_1} ?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute [Si/H] for each star.

Because the problem is to find n_Si1 / n_Si2.

So let's compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0 =0.3.

Wait, wait, is that correct? Because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H], provided Y is another element. Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, because [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

Similarly, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun).

So [X/Y] + [Y/H] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) + log(nY/nH) - log(nY_sun/nH_sun).

Hmm, I'm not sure if that adds up to [X/H]. Let me try:

log(nX/nY) + log(nY/nH) = log(nX/nH).

Similarly, the sun terms: - [log(nX_sun/nY_sun) + log(nY_sun/nH_sun)] = - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So yes, [X/Y] + [Y/H] = [X/H].

So that's correct. So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Which means log(nSi1/nH1) =0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, because [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3.

So for Star_1:

nSi1/nH1 = nSi_sun/nH_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Now, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, same idea. Let's compute [Si/H]_2.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Hmm, but how to get [Si/H]_2 from this.

Alternatively, perhaps express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, let's think: [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg2/nH2) =0 + log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → log(nMg2/nH2)=log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Now, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

Similarly, nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 * 10^{something}.

Wait, let me try to find [Si/H]_2.

We can write:

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

So log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2.

Similarly, nSi2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 * (nSi2 / nSi_sun) ?

Wait, maybe better to express [Si/H]_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun * nH2)/nH_sun.

Similarly, nSi2 = (nSi_sun * nH2)/nH_sun.

So nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * (nSi2 /nSi2) → no, wait:

Wait, nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

So nMg2/nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 ] / [ (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 ] = nMg_sun / nSi_sun.

Which would mean log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) → so [Mg/Si]_2 would be zero. But according to the problem, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So that can't be right. Hmm, I must be making a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. If [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, then:

log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

But from [Mg/H]_2=0, nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH2.

Similarly, nSi2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH2 * 10^{ [Si/H]_2 - [Si_sun/H_sun] }.

Wait, perhaps I should model [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

Which can be written as log(nMg2/(nH2 * x)) = ... Hmm, perhaps it's better to express [Si/H]_2.

Wait, perhaps I can write [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Because [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Wait, let me see:

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) =0.3.

But log(nMg2/nSi2) = log( (nMg2/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = log(nMg2/nH2) + log(nH2/nSi2).

Which is [Mg/H]_2 + [H/Si]_2.

But [H/Si]_2 = - [Si/H]_2.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

So, 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Which means log(nSi2/nH2) = [Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = -0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, but we don't have the Sun's [Si/H]. So we need to find it.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not given, but from its composition, perhaps we can find [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about Si?

Hmm, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun.

Wait, but in the Sun, everything is solar, so [X/Y]_sun =0 for any X and Y.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about it.

In the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun would be log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.

So for the Sun, [Si/Fe] is 0.

But wait, I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun because it's not provided.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the Sun's [Si/H] using the given data.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5.

So, nFe/nH =1e-4.5, nMg/nH=1e-5.

But to find nSi/nH, I need more information. Perhaps I can assume that the Sun's composition has a known ratio of Si to Fe and Mg. Wait, in reality, I think the Sun's Mg/Si is around 0.5 or something, but I'm not sure. But in this problem, perhaps it's better to compute based on the given data.

Wait, but the question gives [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. But for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0. So earlier we found [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

But to find [Si/H]_2, we need to know the Sun's [Si/H], which would be [Si/H]_sun = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = ?

Hmm, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given, but perhaps I can compute it from the given data.

Wait, let's think about the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Since [Si/Fe]_sun is 0 because it's the reference point.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.

So, nSi_sun/nFe_sun = nSi_sun/nFe_sun.

Wait, that's trivial. So, nSi_sun = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Hmm, but I don't have the value of nSi_sun/nFe_sun. So perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of the Sun's values.

Let me write down the expressions for [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

Star_1:
[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) =0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Star_2:
[Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → log(nSi2/nH2) =-0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

We need the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH1).

Wait, because:

nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = [ (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nH2) ? Wait, no, perhaps better to write it as:

nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) ) → because (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nH2) is (nH1/nH2)^2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to factor it.

nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) ) → but that's (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) * (nH1/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH2) is same as (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH1/nH2) ) * (nH2^2 / nH2^2) → maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write:

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH2 /nH1 )

Because:

nSi1 = (nSi1/nH1) *nH1

nSi2 = (nSi2/nH2) *nH2

So nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi1/nH1) *nH1 ] / [ (nSi2/nH2) *nH2 ] = [ (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2) )

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2 )

Now, let's compute each part.

First, compute (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2 )

(nSi1/nH1) =10^{ [Si/H]_1 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) }

Wait, no, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3.

So log(nSi1/nH1) =0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)

Similarly, log(nSi2/nH2) = [Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )= -0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)

So,

log( (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi2/nH2) )= [0.3 + log(Si_sun)] - [ -0.3 + log(Si_sun) ]= 0.3 + log(Si_sun) +0.3 - log(Si_sun) )= 0.6.

So, (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Next, compute (nH1/nH2) → but wait, the ratio of H in Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, but unless given, I don't think we can find nH1 and nH2 separately. Hmm, that complicates things. Oh wait, but maybe the mass of the stars doesn't affect the abundance ratios, since abundance is a ratio. So perhaps the H density cancels out.

Wait, but in the expression for nSi1/nSi2, we have (nH1/nH2) as a factor.

But without knowing the ratio of H densities, we can't proceed. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should model the stars' abundances relative to hydrogen and then find the ratio.

Wait, let's denote:

For Star_1:

nFe1/nH1 = Fe_sun / H_sun =1e-4.5 → because [Fe/H]_1=0.

nSi1/nH1 = Si_sun / H_sun * 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } → because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) =0.3 + log(Si_sun / H_sun).

So nSi1/nH1 = (Si_sun / H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

For Star_2:

nMg2/nH2 = Mg_sun / H_sun =1e-5 → because [Mg/H]_2=0.

nSi2/nH2 = Si_sun / H_sun * 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → 10^(-0.3) ≈0.501.

So,

nSi2/nH2 = (Si_sun / H_sun ) * 10^{-0.3}.

Now, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2 )

= [ (Si_sun/H_sun)*10^{0.3} ] * (nH2/nH1) / [ (Si_sun/H_sun)*10^{-0.3} ]

Simplify:

= (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) ) * (nH2/nH1 )

=10^{0.6} * (nH2/nH1 )

10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So, nSi1/nSi2 =3.98 * (nH2/nH1 )

But I don't know the ratio of nH2/nH1. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps the number densities of hydrogen are related to the star's overall composition. Since the Sun and the stars have different masses, but the problem states "photospheric composition", which is about abundances, not the actual number of atoms.

Wait, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms is proportional to the star's mass, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in each star is the same as the ratio of their masses, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the mass in terms of H, so maybe the H ratio is 1. Or perhaps I can assume that the ratio of H in each star is similar, but that doesn't make sense because the stars have different masses. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. The problem is about the photospheric composition, which is about the abundance ratios, not the total number of H atoms. So perhaps the actual number of H atoms isn't directly important as long as we're looking at abundance ratios.

Wait, but in the expression for nSi1/nSi2, it's multiplied by (nH2/nH1). So without knowing that ratio, I can't find the exact value. But maybe it's not needed, perhaps the H ratio cancels out.

Wait, maybe I can express nH in terms of the star's total mass or radius, but I don't have that data.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because I'm missing some key information. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the number of H atoms in the star's photosphere is the same as the number of H in the Sun's photosphere, multiplied by the mass ratio. But that's not correct; the number of atoms depends on the star's mass and the element's abundance.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of H atoms in the star is proportional to the star's mass. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the solution doesn't require knowing the H ratio because the H cancels out. Let me see.

Wait, nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH2/nH1 )

= [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH2/nH1 )

But nH1 and nH2 are the number densities of H in each star. So if I can find the ratio (nH2/nH1), then I can compute the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in each star is the same as the ratio of their masses, assuming the same composition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the star's mass is given as 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But the photospheric composition is given, which refers to the abundance, not the total number. So I don't think the mass is directly relevant here. Unless the star's radius comes into play, but that's not given either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, earlier I found that the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) is 10^0.6 ≈3.98. So that part is about 3.98.

But I'm stuck on the (nH2/nH1) term. Perhaps I should consider that in the photosphere, the number of H atoms is determined by the star's overall H abundance, but without knowing the absolute number, perhaps I can assume that the ratio (nH2/nH1) is 1. But that would make the total ratio about 3.98, which is option A.

But why would that be the case? Because the stars have different masses, but their photospheric H densities might be similar? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] can help us find [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH)_sun - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0.

Wait, no, I'm not getting anywhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 can be found without considering H, because in the ratio, H cancels out.

Wait, let me think again about the ratio nSi1/nSi2.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun / H_sun) * H1 * 10^{0.3}.

nSi2 = (nSi_sun / H_sun) * H2 * 10^{-0.3}.

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [H1 / H2 ] * [10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} ]

= [H1/H2] * 10^{0.6}.

So nSi1/nSi2 = (H1/H2) * 3.98.

But we don't know H1 and H2.

Wait, but perhaps the total number of H atoms in the star's photosphere is proportional to the star's mass and the H abundance. But without knowing the star's radius, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio H1/H2 is equal to the ratio of the stars' masses. Because, if both have the same H abundance, then more massive star has more H atoms. But the problem states that the Sun's H is given, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says that the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, but that's about abundance, not the number. So perhaps H1 and H2 are not directly related to the star's mass but to their abundance.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is simply 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98, which is option A. So the ratio is about 3.9, which is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided photospheric composition of the Sun. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Information and Definitions:
1. **Abundance Notation**: The notation \([X/Y]\) represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number density of element \(X\) to \(Y\) relative to the Sun:
   \[
   [X/Y] = \log_{10}(n_X / n_Y) - \log_{10}(n_X^{\odot} / n_Y^{\odot}),
   \]
   where \(n_X^{\odot}\) and \(n_Y^{\odot}\) are the number densities of \(X\) and \(Y\) in the Sun.

2. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - For iron: \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5\).
   - For magnesium: \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5\).

3. **Star_1**:
   - \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\): This means \(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}\) in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.
   - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\): Using the definition of abundance notation:
     \[
     \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{Fe}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}) + 0.3.
     \]
     Substituting \(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}\), we find:
     \[
     \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{H}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}) + 0.3.
     \]
     Thus, \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\).

4. **Star_2**:
   - \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\): This means \(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}\) in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.
   - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\): Using the definition of abundance notation:
     \[
     \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{Si}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}) + 0.3.
     \]
     Substituting \(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}\), we find:
     \[
     \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{H}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}) - 0.3.
     \]
     Thus, \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
To find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{H}})_1}{(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{H}})_2}.
\]
From the abundance values:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{H}})_1 = 0.3 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}),
\]
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{H}})_2 = -0.3 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}).
\]
Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{H}})_1}{(n_{\text{Si}} / n_{\text{H}})_2} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
