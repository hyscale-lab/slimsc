Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR spectroscopy isn't my strongest subject. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that compound X (C11H12O) reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they gave the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. I need to figure out what compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, wait, that reaction. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation, right? No, wait, Sharpless uses a different reagent. Or maybe it's used for epoxide ring-opening? Wait, actually, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide reactions, perhaps as a nucleophile. Oh wait, no, the reaction conditionsâ€”maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide? Or maybe the original compound X is an epoxide and this reagent is doing something else.

Wait, the options are all epoxides or compounds with an epoxide group. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's a oxirane (epoxide) ring attached to a styryl group which has a methyl at the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the epoxide is attached to a propenyl group which has a phenyl at the 1-position and maybe a branching.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide has substituents at positions 2 and 3. Position 2 has a methyl and position 3 has a styryl group.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the styryl group is attached to the 2-position of the epoxide.

Wait, but wait. The product's NMR is given. The reaction involved using 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2
