Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from my classes that when dealing with moving media and light, it's related to the index of refraction and maybe some Doppler effects or something like that. 

Wait, the question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Oh, right, so the glass is moving towards the observer but in the same direction the light is going. That's a bit confusing because I thought when the medium moves towards you, it usually affects things like the observed frequency or speed.

So the light beam is propagating through the glass. The glass's index of refraction is n. Wait, normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? But that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving, so how does that affect things?

I'm a bit rusty on this. I think this might involve the addition of velocities, maybe using special relativity or something. Oh wait, but light's speed is always c in a vacuum, but in a medium, it's c/n. But what if the medium is moving?

Wait, the speed of light in the medium is v_light = c / n. But the medium itself is moving. So from the lab frame, the speed would be different? Or do you just add the velocities? Like, the light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n, and since the medium is moving at v, does the lab frame see the light's
