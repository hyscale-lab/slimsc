Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of metal-ligand complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The blue complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands, so that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Because I think the dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached.

So the given stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait. Stability constants are usually for the formation of the complexes. So for a metal ion M^n+ and ligands L, the β value for ML^n+ is the formation constant for ML^n+.

Wait, but how are these β values ordered? I think β1 is for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Hmm, or maybe the order is different. Or perhaps β1 corresponds to the first step, so maybe β1 is the first ionization. Wait, no, stability constants are cumulative. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 is for the second, etc. So [Co(SCN)]^+ would have β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) would have β2=40, [Co(SCN)_3] would have β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4]^3- would have β4=16. Hmm, wait, but the β4 is lower than β3, which is a bit odd. Oh, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Let me think.

Wait, the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the largest, which suggests that the third complex is the most stable. But wait, that can't be right because β3 is the third step. Or perhaps the way the question is presented, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, but in any case, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), so that would correspond to β2=40.

So the approach should be to calculate the fraction of each possible species present in solution and then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato species.

The initial concentrations are [Co^2+] = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all possible complexes, from [Co^2+] to [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

Each complex is formed by adding SCN- to the previous one. The formation of each complex is governed by the stability constant βn.

The general approach is to use the formation constants to find the fraction of each complex.

So, let's denote the complexes as:

1. Co^2+ (free ion)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ → formed from Co^2+ + SCN^-
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) → formed from [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^-
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^0 → formed from [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) + SCN^-
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^3- → formed from [Co(SCN)_3]^0 + SCN^-

But wait, the given β values are β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

So the problem is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN
