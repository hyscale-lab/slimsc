Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. So the setup is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, they turn that field off and turn on another one along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. Its magnetic moment mu is aligned with the field. Then the field is switched to Y. I'm trying to remember what happens when the magnetic field changes direction for a spin-1/2 particle.

I think when the magnetic field is along Z, the particle's spin precesses around Z. But when they switch the field to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The energy levels will change accordingly. Since the magnetic field is turned off and then on in a different direction, the state of the system might no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

The magnetic moment's average z-component oscillates. So I'm thinking about expectation values and time evolution. For a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of an observable can oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy difference between states.

The initial state is probably an eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian (along Z). When the field changes to Y, the particle's state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So it will evolve over time, and the expectation values will oscillate.

The energy levels when the magnetic field is along a different direction will have different splitting. Let me recall the formula for energy levels in a magnetic field. The energy E is proportional to gamma times B times the component of spin along the field direction. For spin-1/2, the spin component can be ±1/2 ħ, but wait, I'm getting confused with units here. Actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is in units of ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So maybe I should think in terms of the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = - mu · B. Oh wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to spin S, so mu = gamma S. So the Hamiltonian should be H = - mu · B. But wait, sometimes it's written as H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction unit vector. So when B is along Z, n is (0,0,1). Then H = -gamma B S_z.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Then, when B is turned along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H' = -gamma B S_y. Because the previous state is not an eigenstate of H', the system will evolve in time.

The time evolution is determined by the Schrödinger equation. The expectation value of an observable O will depend on the matrix elements of O in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates.

Wait, but the question is about the average of the z-component of mu, which is mu_z. Since mu is gamma S_z, the average <mu_z> will oscillate. The frequency of oscillation should be determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates of H'.

So let me think about the eigenvalues of H'. H' = -gamma B S_y. The spin-1/2 system's S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H' will have eigenvalues E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2), but wait, wait: S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, so when multiplied by -gamma B, the eigenvalues become -gamma B (ħ/2)(±1) = ± (-gamma B ħ/2)(-1) ? Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H' and then find how the expectation values change over time.

The initial state when the field was along Z is a spin-up state in the z-direction, say |+z>. The Hamiltonian after the switch is H' = -gamma B S_y. The eigenstates of H' are the eigenstates of S_y. So the eigenstates are |+y> and |−y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>.

So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y> and |−y>. Let me write that down.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) and |−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2). So the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

The time evolution is given by each state |+y> and |−y> evolving with their respective phases. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H' t / ħ). Since H' has eigenvalues E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2)(-1) * (-1) ? Wait, let me compute H' correctly.

Wait H' = -gamma B S_y. S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H' = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. Thus, H' has eigenvalues E = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (+1) and E = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1). So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (1) = - gamma B ħ / 2. E_- = gamma B ħ / 2.

Wait, no, wait: the eigenvalues
