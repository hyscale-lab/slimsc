Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

Compound A is C3H6. Hmm, wait, the molecular formula for A is C3H6. I remember that the general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. For n=3, that would be C3H8. So A can't be an alkane. Alternatively, C3H6 could be an alkene or an alkyne.

Wait, alkenes have the formula CnH2n. For n=3, that's C3H6. So A is probably propene or cyclopropane. Wait, cyclopropane is C3H6 too. But given the reactions, let's think more about that.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of CCl4. So bromination of an alkene is typically an addition reaction. If A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), then bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. Alternatively, if it's cyclopropane, bromination might not be the same. Wait, cyclopropane is strained and can undergo bromonium ring opening, but I'm not entirely sure.

Assuming A is propene, then bromination would form 1,2-dibromopropane (if addition occurs) or perhaps more likely, it would form 1-bromo-1-propene? Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. When Br2 adds, it would do a dibromide addition. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, wait: propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane.

Wait, alternative: maybe A is cyclopropane. But cyclopropane has all single bonds but high ring strain. Bromination of cyclopropane might lead to ring opening. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to proceed under the assumption that A is propene.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So in the presence of a dihalide, it would undergo elimination, probably an E2 mechanism, leading to the formation of an alkene. So if B is 1,2-dibrom
