Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's either propene or propane. Wait, propane would be C3H8, so no, must be propene. So A is propene.

First reaction: A undergoes bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when it reacts with Br2 in CCl4, it'll add bromine across the double bond. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Adding Br2 to propene would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, likely leading to an elimination reaction. So dehydrohalogenation, E2 mechanism. Let's see, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So two adjacent Br atoms on the central carbon.

When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base. So the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr. But wait, B is a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Brs). So the reaction could be dehydrohalogenation, but since we have two adjacent Brs, perhaps it will form an alkyne? Wait, no. Wait, for vicinal dihalides reacting with strong base like alcoholic KOH, it can lead to elimination of two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. But wait, in this case, we started with propene, added Br2, making 1,2-dibromopropane. Now, eliminating two HBr would give back propene? Because removing two Br's would leave a double bond.

Wait, so B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would lose two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of propene again. Because:

CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 + 2 KOH (alcohol) → CH2=CHCH3 + 2 KBr + 2 H2O.

So Compound C is propene again. But wait, what's the structure. Oh wait, wait. Let me think again. No, wait, wait. The starting compound is propene, which is CH2=CH2CH3? No, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When bromine adds, it's CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when KOH (alcohol) is added, the base would remove a hydrogen adjacent to each Br. So each Br leaves as Br-, and the double bond reforms.

So yes, C is propene again. Wait, but wait. Wait, but propene is an alkene. So when it's treated with a strong base, maybe it undergoes some other reaction. No, wait, no. Because the base is in an alcoholic solution, and it's a dihalide. So the reaction would be dehydrohalogenation twice, removing both Brs and reforming the double bond. So C is propene.

But wait, sometimes when you have a dihalide and a strong base, you can get more substitution, but in this case, since it's vicinal dihalide, elimination is more likely, especially with a strong base like alcoholic KOH.

Wait, but wait again. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction gives 1,2-dibromopropane, and when treated with alcoholic KOH, maybe it's a double elimination, producing propene. So C is propene.

Moving on. Next step: compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube, producing Compound D. Red-hot iron... that sounds like a catalyst for something. Oh, probably dehydrohalogenation or maybe hydrogenation. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if I have propene (C) and pass it through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a dehydration reaction. Wait, but propene is already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking reaction? Or perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but that would add H2. Alternatively, maybe it's a process to convert alkenes to alkanes. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a process to form an alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the propene is being subjected to some kind of reaction that produces another compound. Wait, when alkenes pass through a red-hot iron, perhaps it's a process to form cyclopropane, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction. Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. If C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), and when it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a reaction where the iron acts as a catalyst for some reaction. Wait, another possibility: maybe the iron is a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation, but that doesn't apply here since C is an alkene.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the reaction steps again. So after the first reaction, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, C is propene again. Then, C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which might be a catalyst for some reaction, like hydrogenation. If so, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would react with hydrogen (if present) to form propane (CH3CH2CH3). But wait, the question doesn't mention H2, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing some kind of cracking or isomerization. Alternatively, maybe the propene is being dehydrogenated to form something else. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: what comes after D? D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Then, E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Finally, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Hmm, perhaps D is a compound that upon reaction with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and H2SO3, or perhaps H2SO4 and HNO3) would form something else. Alternatively, maybe D is a nitrated compound.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on what D could be. Let me think again about the step where C is passed through a red-hot iron. If C is propene, and D is something else, maybe D is a di-substituted product. Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, if the double bond is hydrogenated. But without H2, that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the red-hot iron is a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propene, but that doesn't fit here because C is propene. Wait, maybe the process is more about isomerization, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think further. If C is propene, and upon passing through red-hot iron, D is formed. Then, D reacts with two strong acids to form E. Let's think about possible products.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the iron tube is causing the alkene to react in a different way. Wait, maybe it's a process to form an alkyne. For example, if propene is subjected to dehydrohalogenation twice, but that would require HX. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation without any HX, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key reaction. Wait, when propene is treated with a red-hot iron, maybe it's undergoing a reaction to form cyclopropane. But how? Oh, the Simmons-Smith reaction uses a zinc-copper couple to form cyclopropane, but that's not involving iron.

Alternatively, perhaps the propene is undergoing some kind of oxidation. Oh, wait, maybe it's reacting with oxygen in the presence of iron. But that's more about combustion, which would produce CO2 and H2O, but that's probably not what's happening here.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed and see what comes next. D is reacted with two strong acids to form E. Then E is reacted with iron and HCl to form F. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane. Because if C is propene and passing through iron leads to hydrogenation, then D would be propane. Then, reacting D (propane) with two strong acids—maybe that's a sulfonation or nitration reaction. But wait, two strong acids? Maybe H2SO4 and HNO3. But that's more for nitration, which typically uses a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3.

Wait, but wait, D is propane, which is an alkane. Alkanes are generally unreactive towards nitration and sulfonation unless under very high pressure, which isn't indicated here. So that might not be it.

Alternatively, maybe D is something else. Let's think again: perhaps when propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron, it's a catalyst for a reaction. Wait, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but without H2, how? Unless the iron is a catalyst for some other process.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound C. Let's go back to that step.

Wait, when B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH, it might eliminate HBr twice. But wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Eliminating two HBr molecules would require losing two Brs. So, perhaps the structure after elimination would be CH2CH2CH3, but that can't be right because that would be CH2CH2CH3, which is not possible. Wait, perhaps it's forming an alkyne? Because sometimes, when you have a vicinal dihalide and eliminate both halogens, you form an alkyne. So, maybe the product is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Wait, that's possible.

Wait, wait a second. Propyne is CH≡CCH3. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3), then elimination of two HBr molecules would give CH≡CCH3. So perhaps compound C is propyne.

Ah, that's a better possibility. So, when B (1,2-dibromopropane) is treated with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, propyne. So C is propyne.

Then, when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, what happens? Hmm. Sometimes, alkynes can be hydrogenated with a catalyst, but without H2, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the iron is a catalyst for some kind of addition.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a trans-alkene under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a process to reduce the alkyne to an alkane. Wait, but how?

Wait, when an alkyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but without H2 present, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being subjected to some other reaction. Wait, perhaps the iron isn't a catalyst but is part of a reaction. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the propyne, when passed through a red-hot iron, isomerizes or undergoes some reaction to form another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being reduced to an alkene.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne (C) is subjected to a reaction that forms a trans-alkene. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about what comes after D. D is reacted with two strong acids to form E. Let's say D is an alkyne. If D is propyne (CH≡CCH3), then reacting with two strong acids could be a di-addition or some kind of substitution.

Wait, another possibility: if D is propyne, and it reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's undergoing a hydration reaction. For example, using H2SO4 as a catalyst and HgSO4, propyne could undergo hydration to form propan-2-ol (isopropyl alcohol). But two strong acids—maybe H2SO4 and another acid.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a nitrile. Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of D with two strong acids produces a substituted compound. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should reconsider. Let's think about compound D as propane. Then, when D (propane) reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's undergoing some sulfonation or nitration. But alkanes don't react easily with strong acids unless under high pressure or with a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me step back and list all the compounds step by step.

A: C3H6 → Propene (CH2=CHCH3).

B: Propene + Br2/CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).

C: B + alcoholic KOH → elimination of two HBr → propyne (CH≡CCH3).

D: C (propyne) passed through a red-hot iron tube.

Wait, when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron, what happens? Hmm. Maybe it's a hydrogenation catalyst. But without H2, perhaps it's just passing through, but maybe the iron is causing some kind of decomposition. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a trans-alkene. Or maybe it's being deprotonated.

Alternatively, perhaps the iron tube is causing the alkyne to react with oxygen, but that's more like oxidation, which would produce CO2 and H2O. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being converted into a different compound. Wait, perhaps it's a process to form an alkane. But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being subjected to a reduction. For example, using iron as a reducing agent. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is being hydrogenated to form an alkene. If D is propene again, then when D reacts with strong acids, perhaps it's undergoing some addition.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the possible products and see what makes sense with the next steps.

So, D is an alkene. Then, D is reacted with two strong acids. Let's say D is propene. Then, reacting with H2SO4 and HNO3 (as strong acids) would probably lead to nitration. So E would be nitropropane.

Wait, but wait, nitration of propene (CH2=CHCH3) would typically add a nitro group. Where would it add? Probably at the more substituted position due to stability. So the nitro group would add to the central carbon, making CH2=CH-NO2-CH3? No, wait, that's not correct because propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So nitration would likely form (CH2)2C-NO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would lead to a more substituted alkene, but I'm not exactly sure.

Then, E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. So E is nitropropane. Iron and HCl would be a reducing environment. So, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced. Nitro groups can be reduced to amines. So F would be something like CH2=CHCH2NH2? Wait, but that's a primary amine.

Wait, but propene is CH2=CHCH3. If E is CH2=CHCH2NO2, then upon reduction, it would become CH2=CHCH2NH2. Then, F is CH2=CHCH2NH2.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines. For primary amines, it can lead to diazotization, forming a diazonium salt. But under certain conditions, it can also lead to other products, like N-nitrous compounds or possibly dehydration.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is being converted into an imine or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the next steps. G reacts with NaOH to form H. So H is the product of G reacting with NaOH. If G is a diazonium salt, then heating with NaOH could lead to substitution, forming a phenol or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options given to see which statement might be incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

I need to find the incorrect statement.

Let me go through each option.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propyne (CH≡CCH3), which is an alkyne. Alkynes are generally flammable gases or liquids, depending on the structure. Propyne is a gas, so yes, it's flammable. So option D is correct. So the statement in D is correct, so it can't be the incorrect one.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propane (CH3CH2CH3), its NMR would show a single peak for all nine H's. So that's a singlet. So statement C would be incorrect if D is propane. Alternatively, if D is propene, then its NMR would have two sets of peaks: the doublet for the CH2 groups and the triplet for the CH3. Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The structure is CH2=CH2CH3? No, it's CH2=CHCH3. Wait, the NMR of propene: the CH2 group next to the double bond would be a triplet (coupled with the CH3 group and the adjacent CH2), but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's think: in propene (CH2=CHCH3), the two CH2 groups are not equivalent. The CH2 on the left (CH2=) is adjacent to the double bond. But wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH3? No, it's CH2=CHCH3. So the central CH is double-bonded to CH2, and attached to CH3.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH2CH3? No, it's CH2=CHCH3. So the molecule is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH3.

In NMR, the CH2 group (the one attached to the double bond) would show as a quartet because it's adjacent to the double bond. Wait, no, the splitting comes from the neighboring groups. The CH2= would be split by the adjacent CH group. Wait, perhaps the CH2 is a quartet, and the CH3 is a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is a triplet and the CH3 is a triplet as well due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to say that if D is propane, its NMR would be a singlet, so option C's statement that D gives two singlets would be incorrect. But wait, if D is propane, it's CH3CH2CH3, which has only one type of H, so one singlet. So option C says two singlets, which wouldn't be correct. Alternatively, if D is another compound, like propene, then its NMR would have more complex splitting.

Wait, but earlier I thought D could be propane. So if D is propane, then C's statement is incorrect because only one singlet would be observed.

Alternatively, if D is propene, then its NMR would have two sets of peaks. For example, the CH2= group would be a quartet (since each H is adjacent to the CH group, which has two H's), and the CH3 would be a triplet (adjacent to the CH2 group). So the NMR would have two distinct sets of peaks, each a quartet and a triplet. So in that case, option C's statement that D gives two singlets would be incorrect, because the peaks are multiplets, not singlets.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on that. Let's move to other options.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride is FeCl3. A yellow color suggests the formation of a precipitate. For example, phenolphthalein doesn't fit. Alternatively, the presence of an aromatic ring with activating groups can cause the benzidine test to give a precipitate. Or perhaps H is a phenol, which would form a white precipitate with FeCl3 because of the formation of a phenolic acid. Alternatively, if H is a nitro compound, FeCl3 wouldn't react. Or maybe H is a ketone, which wouldn't react either.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a benzene ring with a substituent that reacts with FeCl3. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is the product after E is treated with iron and HCl. If E is a nitro compound, then F would be an amine. Amines can be used in the synthesis of dyes, so option A would be correct.

Now, back to the options.

If D is propane, then option C would be incorrect because the NMR would show a single singlet, not two. But wait, the step where C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron. If that step converts propyne into propane, then D would be propane.

But how?

Wait, maybe the process is catalytic hydrogenation. So, propyne (CH≡CCH3) is reacted with H2 in the presence of a catalyst like iron, leading to the formation of propane (CH3CH2CH3). So D is propane.

If that's the case, then D is propane. So when D (propane) is reacted with two strong acids, perhaps it's undergoing sulfonation or nitration. But alkanes don't usually react with strong acids under normal conditions. Unless it's under high pressure or with a specific catalyst, which the question doesn't mention.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about that step. Let me think again. If C is propyne and D is propane, then what would happen when D reacts with two strong acids? It's unclear, but perhaps under certain conditions, like using concentrated H2SO4, propane could undergo some reaction, but I'm not sure what.

Alternatively, maybe D isn't propane but another compound.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong in the earlier step. Let's think again.

When C is propyne (CH≡CCH3), and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's undergoing a reaction to form a different alkyne or an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being deprotonated, but that's more of a reaction under basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a trans-alkene. Wait, but I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne isn't reacting and D is the same as C, which is propyne. But that seems unlikely.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me try to move forward and see if I can find the incorrect statement.

Looking at the options again:

Option C says D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propane, then it's a single singlet. So if C says two, that's incorrect. So option C would be the incorrect statement.

Alternatively, if D is propene, then its NMR would have more than two peaks, perhaps a triplet and a quartet, but not two singlets. So the statement in C would be incorrect.

Wait, but if D is propene (CH2=CHCH3), then the NMR would have a quartet for the CH2 group and a triplet for the CH3. So two different peaks, but not singlets. Hence, option C's statement is incorrect because it says two singlets, but the protons are split into multiple peaks.

So, which option is the incorrect statement?

The question is asking which of the statements is incorrect about the products.

So, the incorrect statement would be the one that's not true.

So, for option C, if D is propane, then the statement is incorrect because only one singlet is observed. Alternatively, if D is propene, the statement is also incorrect as the peaks are not singlets.

But wait, what if D is not propane but another compound. Let me think again.

Wait, if D is propene, then its NMR would have two sets of peaks: the CH2= group would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So the NMR would have two peaks, but each is a multiplet, not a singlet. So option C's statement that D gives two singlets would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if D is another compound, perhaps with two equivalent protons, such as in a trans-alkene, but I don't think that's the case here.

Therefore, option C is the incorrect statement because D's NMR would not have two singlets.

Wait, but let's think about D again. If D is propane, the NMR would have a single peak, which is a singlet. So the statement that D gives two singlets is incorrect. Hence, option C is the incorrect statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about D. Let me think again: what if D is propene, then the NMR would have a quartet and a triplet. So two peaks, but not singlets. So option C's statement is incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the incorrect statement is option C, which says D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. Because if D is either propane (single singlet) or propene (two multiplets), then the statement is incorrect. Hence, option C is the incorrect statement.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂BrCHBrCH₃) as Compound B. Treatment of B with alcoholic KOH leads to double dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two HBr molecules and reforming the double bond, resulting in propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) as Compound C. 

When Compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes catalytic hydrogenation, converting the double bond into a single bond to form propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃) as Compound D. Propane is an alkane, and alkanes are generally unreactive toward strong acids under normal conditions. However, for the sake of the reaction sequence, it is assumed that D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form Compound E, likely a substituted product such as a nitro compound. 

Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, reducing the nitro group to an amine, forming Compound F. This amine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) is flammable, making Option A correct. When F reacts with nitrous acid, it forms a diazonium salt (Compound G), which reacts with sodium hydroxide to form Compound H, likely a phenol derivative. Phenols react with ferric chloride to form a white precipitate, making Option B correct.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F is a primary amine and can be used in the synthesis of dyes. This is correct.
- **Option B**: H reacts with ferric chloride to form a white precipitate, consistent with phenol derivatives. This is correct.
- **Option C**: D is propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃), which has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum, corresponding to a singlet. The statement that D gives two singlets is incorrect.
- **Option D**: C is propene (CH₂=CHCH₃), which is a flammable gas. This is correct.

The incorrect statement is **Option C**, as D (propane) does not give two singlets in its ¹H NMR spectrum. 

Answer: C
