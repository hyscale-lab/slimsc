Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible for it. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I think is ethyl methanesulfonate, a chemical mutagen that typically causes point mutations, often leading to changes in the DNA sequence.

They sequenced the target gene in all the mutants and found changes in the first exon. The intact gene and the four mutants are given as sequences. We need to figure out which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, maybe a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Let me look at the sequences. The intact gene is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

And the mutants are numbered 1 to 4. Each is a variant of this.

Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Starting with Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact gene, let's line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...

Wait, maybe I should look for differences. Let's compare each triplet.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the sequences differ. Let me count the nucleotides.

Intact: starts with ATG, then TTT, then CTC, GCT, etc.

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC ... Hmm, let me check each position.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the mutations are. Let's compare each position.

Intact: position 4-6 is TTT (codon 2). Mutant 1 has TTT as well. But let's look at the next codon.

Intact: next is CTC (codon 3). Mutant 1 has CTA (codon 3? Or is the change elsewhere? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's write them out letter by letter.

Intact: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A
