Okay, so I have this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think this through step by step.

The question is about why certain peaks in a ChIP-seq experiment disappear when using a different fixation method. The setup is that they used PFA-fixed samples with an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After sequencing, they did standard quality control, alignment, and peak-calling. But when they switched to PFA+DSG fixation, the peaks disappeared.

Hmm, I remember that fixation methods can affect the ChIP-seq results. PFA is paraformaldehyde, which I think cross-links proteins to DNA. DSG is dithiothreitol, which is a reducing agent. Wait, I think DSG is used during the cell lysis step to reverse some of the cross-linking, maybe to make the chromatin more accessible for sonication or fragmentation.

So, when you fix with PFA alone, it cross-links everything, including proteins to DNA and proteins to each other. But maybe DSG treatment after fixation helps in fragmenting the DNA more efficiently or loosening the cross-links so that the sonication can break the chromatin into smaller pieces. Or perhaps without DSG, the chromatin remains too tightly cross-linked, making it harder to shear and therefore leading to issues in sequencing.

Wait, I've heard that PFA alone can lead to more background noise or non-specific binding because it might fix proteins that are not actually bound to DNA but are in close proximity. If they use DSG in addition, maybe it helps in digesting the cross-linked chromatin more efficiently, leading to better resolution of the actual binding sites.

So in the original experiment, using just PFA, they got some peaks. But when they added DSG, those peaks disappeared. That suggests that the peaks were false positives or non-specific signals. Why would that happen?

I think when you fix with PFA without DSG, the cross-linking is more extensive. So, during the sonication step, the DNA fragments might be over-sheared or not sheared properly because the cross-links are too strong. Alternatively, maybe the regions that are more open or accessible, like active promoters or enh
