Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem begins with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows some specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone.

Hmm, so when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it's probably undergoing an elimination reaction. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, considering the structure of adamantane, which is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, the dibromide would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Or wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is on carbons that are three apart, so maybe it's a diepoxide or something else. But wait, when you eliminate two bromides, maybe it forms an epoxide? No, wait, elimination usually forms alkenes. Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond. But where?

Wait, the product is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? Or perhaps it's an elimination forming an ketone. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of an alkene, but then perhaps another reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromide would form a cyclopropane upon elimination, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait a minute, perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening of some sort. Wait, no—adamantane is a very stable structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Hmm, but 1,3-dibromoad
