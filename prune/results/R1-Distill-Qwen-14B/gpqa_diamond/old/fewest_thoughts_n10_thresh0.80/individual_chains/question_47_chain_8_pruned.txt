Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what we can do.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 suggest the presence of N-H stretches. Those are usually from amines or amides. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is likely a carbonyl group. Could be ester, amide, ketone, or maybe an acyl chloride, but that's less likely here.

Now onto the 1H NMR. Let's break it down:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl. The triplet suggests it's connected to another CH2 group.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Maybe an ethoxy group, but wait, the H's in OCH2CH3 usually are around 1.2 (the triplet) and the OCH2 is around 4.1 as a quartet. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe an NH group, but I'm not sure.
Wait, but there's a 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H). Quartet with 2H. So that's another CH2 group. If the 4.0 is a singlet, maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else. Maybe an OCH2 adjacent to another CH2, like in an ester group.

Let me think about the possible structures. The options are A) 3-ethoxybenzamide, B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, C) 4-aminophenyl propionate, D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Let's go through each option's structure.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at the 3 position. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. But wait, in the IR, the N-H stretches are present, which would be in the amide. So that could fit. But the NMR... Let's think.

In benzamide derivatives, the ethoxy group is in the ortho, meta, or para position. For 3-ethoxy, the ethoxy is in the meta position relative to the amide group. The ethoxy group's CH2CH3 would be around 1.2 ppm (triplet), which matches the NMR. The OCH2 would be around 4.0 as a quartet, but in the NMR, there's a quartet at 4.5. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider where the ethoxy is attached. Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from the ester's OCH2.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is a formamide (HCONH-) attached to
