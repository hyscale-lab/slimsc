Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially for removing halides from aromatic rings. But wait, benzene rings usually undergo substitution reactions, not elimination. Hmm, maybe it's a case of aromatic substitution, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, I think that's a typo. Oh, right! Benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? Or maybe that's a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the ring has bromine at the para position relative to the deutero group? Or wait, no, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me think.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, 1 and 2 would be adjacent positions. So, the bromine is at position 1, and the deutero is at position 2. So, they're next to each other on the benzene ring.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, and when used in ammonia, it can cause elimination reactions. But wait, in aromatic contexts, especially when dealing with substituents like halogens, what kind of reactions happen? Oh right, the dehydrohalogenation, which is elimination. But wait, elimination usually leads to formation of a double bond, but benzene is already an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. So that doesn't make much sense. Oh wait, maybe it's a case of nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that to happen, there should be a good leaving group and activating groups on the ring.

Wait, but in this case, the leaving group is Br. But bromine is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing substituent. So nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings typically requires strong activating groups (like -NH2, -OH, etc.) to make the ring susceptible to attack. But here, the substituents are Br and D (deuterium), which is a weak deactivating group, and Br is even more deactivating.

Wait, but maybe it's an elimination reaction leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere? No, that doesn't make sense because benzene is already fully conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbanion. Then, the Br leaves as Br-.

Wait, but where are the protons available? Since the ring is deuterated at position 2, the adjacent position to Br is position 2, which is D. So the available protons would be on adjacent carbons, but wait, benzene is a flat ring. Let me imagine the structure: positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D) are adjacent. So, the Br is at position 1, D at 2, and the other positions are H.

In such a case, the base (NH2-) could abstract a hydrogen from positions ortho, meta, or para to the Br. But wait, the ring is already deactivated because of Br. So, where are the acidic hydrogens?

In aromatic rings, the acidity of protons is influenced by the substituents. Electron-withdrawing groups like Br make the ring less electron-dense, so the protons adjacent (ortho) to Br are more acidic because the negative charge can be delocalized. So, the ortho and para positions to Br may have acidic protons.

Wait, but in this case, position 2 is D, not H. So, the Br is at position 1, so the ortho positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, so the base can't abstract that. So the possible positions for H abstraction would be position 6 (ortho), position 3 and 5 (meta), and position 4 (para).

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br), so H there is ortho. So, if the base abstracts H from position 6, then the Br leaves, and a double bond would form between carbons 1 and 6. But wait, that would create a double bond adjacent to a Br, which can't be right because benzene is already aromatic. Alternatively, maybe the Br leaves, and a benzynelike intermediate forms, but that's more for elimination to form a triple bond or something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with different reaction mechanisms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but in the ring. So, if the Br is at position 1, and a hydrogen is removed from position 6 (ortho), then the Br would leave, and a double bond would form between positions 1 and 6. But that would mean the ring would lose a hydrogen and a bromine, but benzene can't lose an aromatic ring, so that would create a triple bond, forming a benzynes intermediate? I think benzynes are formed when two leaving groups are present, but in this case, only Br is present.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's try to outline the possible steps.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. The reagent is NaNH2 in NH3 (l), which is a strong base. So, perhaps the base abstracts a proton alpha to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzynelike intermediate, which then could undergo various reactions.

Wait, but the Br is in position 1, and the deutero is at position 2. So, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. So, the base could abstract H from position 6 (ortho), but if that happens, then the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6. But that would require another leaving group, which isn't present. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But in this case, what's the nucleophile? The solvent is ammonia, so the NH2- could act as a nucleophile. So, if the ring undergoes nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the NH2- would attack the ring. But for nucleophilic substitution to occur on an aromatic ring, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is a moderate deactivating group, so perhaps the ring isn't activated enough for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but the presence of a deuterium at position 2 might influence the reaction. Deuterium is slightly heavier than H, but in some cases, it can affect reaction rates, perhaps due to kinetic isotope effects. But in this case, I'm not sure how that plays into the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't substitution but elimination, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere. But wait, benzene already has all double bonds. Maybe it's a ring expansion or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, removing the Br and a hydrogen from adjacent carbon to form a triple bond. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, adjacent to the Br at position 1, then the Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons (1 and 6) form a triple bond, leading to the formation of a benzynelike structure. But benzynes are typically very reactive and can undergo various additions or rearrangements. However, in this case, since the ring is already substituted, maybe the benzynelike intermediate is unstable, leading to some rearrangement.

Wait, but the presence of the deuterium at position 2 might affect this. If the base abstracts H from position 6, then the Br at position 1 leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 6, creating a diradical or a triple bond. Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens up, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I'm thinking. Maybe I should consider the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed.

Let me think about the possible structures that can form.

If the reaction is substitution, replacing Br with something else. But NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, so perhaps it's more about elimination. Wait, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but no, that's for alkylation of aromatic rings and requires a Lewis acid catalyst, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps the base deprotonates the ring, and the Br leaves, forming a benzynelike intermediate, which then can undergo different additions. But since the ring has a deuterium, maybe that affects the sites where the intermediate can form.

Wait, but in this case, the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, the possible positions for deprotonation would be ortho (position 6), meta (positions 3 and 5), and para (position 4). Let me list the possible deprotonation sites:

- Position 6 (ortho to Br, adjacent to D at position 2)
- Position 3 (meta to Br)
- Position 5 (meta to Br)
- Position 4 (para to Br)

But since position 2 is D, position 6 is adjacent to D. Wait, does that matter? How does the presence of D affect the acidity of the protons?

The acidity of the protons is influenced by the substituents. A deuterium is slightly less acidic than H because the bond strength is higher. But in this case, the base is strong (NaNH2), so perhaps it can deprotonate even if the hydrogen is less acidic. Alternatively, the presence of D adjacent might influence the stability of the carbanion.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br and D, then the carbanion would form at position 6. Then, the Br would leave, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. But the ring is already aromatic; that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps this leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent in a different position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

If the Br leaves, and a hydrogen is removed from position 6, the ring would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, making a benzene ring with a triple bond, which is not possible. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group or something else. But wait, the reagent is sodium amide in ammonia. So, perhaps the NH2- acts as a nucleophile.

But for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated. Bromine is deactivating, making nucleophilic substitution less likely. But in some cases, when there are strong electron-withdrawing groups, substitution can occur. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzynelike intermediate, which can then undergo further reactions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a quinoid structure. So, the loss of H and Br leads to the formation of a double bond in the ring, but I'm not sure how that would look.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent in a different position. For example, when the base abstracts a proton from position 3 (meta to Br), the Br leaves, and the substituent moves. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of benzene with a new substituent where the H and Br were removed. But I'm not entirely clear on that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures that can form from this reaction. So, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

If the reaction is elimination, removing H from position 6 (ortho to Br), then Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 6. But that would create a triple bond in the benzene ring, which isn't possible. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent on the position where the H was abstracted. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the substituent would be H removed as H-.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring where the Br is replaced by something else. But I'm not sure what, since the reagent is NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, not a nucleophile in this context.

Wait, another approach: consider that NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. But in aromatic compounds, that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a nitrene or some other intermediate, but that's more speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by a deuterium. But why would that happen? NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base but I don't think it contains deuterium. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium is adjacent to the Br, and the base could abstract a proton from a position that's adjacent to the deuterium. But if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or position 5, which are meta to the Br, would that lead to any reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds via a benzyne mechanism. Benzyne is a highly strained alkyne intermediate that can dimerize or react further. So, if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, the Br leaves, forming a triple bond. But wait, to form benzyne, you typically need two leaving groups. Wait, but in this case, perhaps the D is a leaving group. No, D is a deuterium, which isn't a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the formation of a carbanion at position 6. Then, the Br leaves, creating a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, forming benzyne. But wait, benzyne is a diradical, isn't it? So, maybe the benzene ring becomes a triple bond between 1 and 6, making a diradical. Then, the diradical could react with other molecules or undergo further reactions.

But in this case, since the solvent is ammonia, perhaps the diradical could capture an ammonia molecule, leading to different products. Alternatively, the diradical could dimerize, but that's not relevant here because the question is about the products of the reaction, not dimerization.

But if the benzyne intermediate is formed, it can react in different ways. However, the question is about the reaction with NaNH2 in ammonia, which would probably just form the intermediate without further reaction. Or perhaps the intermediate undergoes some rearrangement.

Wait, but if the benzyne is formed, it's in a highly reactive state and can react with various nucleophiles. But in this case, the solvent is ammonia, so perhaps the amide ion (NH2-) could attack the benzyne intermediate.

So, the benzyne (with triple bond between 1 and 6) could react with NH2- at either end. The attack could happen at position 1 or position 6, leading to two different products.

Wait, but position 1 was the original site of Br, and position 6 is adjacent to D. So, if NH2- attacks position 1, the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. If it attacks position 6, the product would be 6-amino-1-deutero benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the addition could happen at either end, leading to different products.

But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. After elimination, the benzyne would have the triple bond between 1 and 6. Then, adding NH2- could happen at either positions 1 or 6, but since position 1 was where Br was, and position 6 is adjacent to D, would that affect the regioselectivity?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne could undergo a ring-opening addition. When benzyne reacts with a nucleophile, it typically adds across the triple bond, leading to a di-substituted benzene. But in the case of NH2-, perhaps it adds to both ends, leading to a diamine product. Wait, but that would require two equivalents of NH2-, which may not be the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyne could capture one equivalent of NH2-, leading to a mono-substituted product.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the possible products.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6, then the benzene ring becomes a benzyne intermediate. Then, the amide ion (NH2-) could attack either end of the triple bond.

So, attack at position 1 would result in an amino group at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Attack at position 6 would result in an amino group at position 6 and a deuterium at position 2.

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 5, which is originally H. So, the product from attack at position 6 would have an amino group at 6, and deuterium at 2. So that's a different product than attacking at position 1.

Additionally, could there be any other products? Maybe if the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, like position 3 or 4, leading to elimination and forming a different triple bond.

Wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is meta to Br, would that lead to elimination? Let me think.

If the base abstracts H from position 3, adjacent to position 2 (D), then the Br at position 1 leaves, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 3. But wait, that's not possible because triple bonds can't form between non-adjacent carbons in a benzene ring. Wait, no, the triple bond would have to be between adjacent carbons. So, maybe the elimination can only happen between adjacent carbons.

So, the H must be abstracted from a position adjacent to Br (positions 2 and 6) to form a triple bond. But position 2 is D, so the only available position is position 6.

Wait, so the base can only abstract H from position 6, because position 2 is D and can't be abstracted. So, elimination would only occur between positions 1 and 6, forming a triple bond there.

So, in that case, the benzyne is formed between 1 and 6. Then, the attack by NH2- could happen at either end of the triple bond.

So, two possible products: amino group at position 1 (but that's where Br was) or at position 6.

But wait, position 1 was the original Br. If the attack happens at position 1, then the product would have an amino group at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. But that would mean that positions 1 and 2 are now amino and deuterium, respectively. Alternatively, if the attack is at position 6, then the amino group would be at 6, with deuterium at 2.

Wait, but when the NH2- attacks, it would add across the triple bond. Let me think about the mechanism. The triple bond is between 1 and 6. The attack would occur at each end, leading to a 1,6-diaminobenzene derivative? Or maybe a single substitution.

Wait, no, because the triple bond is between 1 and 6, when the amide ion attacks, it would add an amino group to each of the carbons involved in the triple bond. So, the product would be 1,6-diamino-2-deutero benzene. But that seems unlikely because adding two amino groups would require two equivalents of NH2-, which may not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack only occurs once, leading to a mono-substituted product. But I'm not sure about the regiochemistry here.

Wait, another approach: in the benzyne intermediate, the ring is highly strained, so it's reactive. When the NH2- attacks, it could do so in a way that forms the most stable product. The amino group is a strong activating group, so perhaps it would prefer to add at certain positions.

But regardless, the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, if the reaction forms only one product, or multiple.

Wait, if the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to the triple bond between 1 and 6, and then the amide ion attacks, leading to an amino group at position 6. So, the product would be 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d? No, wait, because the Br would have left. So, the product would be 6-amino-2-deutero benzene? Wait, but the Br is eliminated, so the product would have an amino group at 6 and D at 2.

Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by an amino group. But that would require substitution, which I'm not sure about.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible products.

1. If the reaction leads to substitution, perhaps Br is replaced by NH2. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.

2. If elimination occurs, forming a triple bond, and then addition of NH2- in different positions, leading to different products.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution or elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then expel the Br- as a leaving group. This would leave a carbanion at the position where the H was removed. Then, the solvent (which has NH3) could protonate it, but since the solvent is deuterated (if any), maybe it's getting deuterated. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the carbanion could pick up an amide group. So, the product would be 6-amino-2-deutero benzene.

Wait, but then what about the Br? It leaves as Br-, so the product would have an amino group where the Br was, but that's position 1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the carbanion forms at position 6, and then the Br leaves, and the NH2- attacks, leading to an amino group at position 6.

So, the product would be 6-amino-2-deutero benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbanion is at position 6, and the Br leaves, forming a triple bond, but that's the benzyne intermediate.

In any case, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product. But wait, if the benzyne intermediate can add the NH2- in two different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, but in the benzyne intermediate, the triple bond is between 1 and 6. So, the attack can happen at either end, leading to substitution at either position 1 or 6. However, position 1 was the original site of Br, so substituting there would lead to a product with amino at 1 and D at 2. Position 6 substitution would lead to amino at 6 and D at 2.

But wait, could both positions be substituted? That would require two equivalents of NH2-, which might not be the case. So, perhaps only one product forms, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the attack occurs only once, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo rearrangement, leading to different products.

Wait, another possibility: the benzyne could undergo a ring expansion or contraction, but that's unlikely for benzene.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium at position 2 affects the product's structure. For example, perhaps the base can't abstract a proton from position 6 due to steric hindrance from the D at position 2. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, considering the structure again: Br is at position 1, D at position 2, and the rest are H. So, position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br) and position 5. H is present at position 6. So, the base can abstract the H at position 6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Then, the addition of NH2- could occur at either position 1 or 6. But position 1 was where Br was, so adding NH2- there would give 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. Adding at position 6 would give 6-amino-2-deutero benzene.

So, two possible products from the attack on the benzyne.

But wait, could there be other products? For example, if the base abstracts a proton from a different position, but earlier I thought that only position 6 is available for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 4 (para to Br), leading to a different elimination.

If the base abstracts H from position 4, which is para to Br at position 1, then the Br would leave, forming a triple bond between 1 and 4?

Wait, no, because position 4 is not adjacent to position 1. So, elimination can't form a triple bond between non-adjacent carbons. So, elimination would only occur between adjacent carbons, i.e., between 1 and 2 or 1 and 6. But position 2 is D, so only position 6 is available.

So, the only possible elimination is between 1 and 6, leading to a triple bond there.

Thus, the benzyne intermediate can add NH2- at either end, leading to two possible products: 1-amino-2-d and 6-amino-2-d.

But wait, another possibility: when the benzyne forms, the structure is symmetric in some way, leading to only one product upon reaction.

Wait, the benzyne structure would have the triple bond between 1 and 6. So, positions 1 and 6 are equivalent in terms of the triple bond's symmetry. So, adding NH2- at either end would lead to the same product. Wait, but in the original molecule, position 2 is D, which is adjacent to position 1.

So, when the triple bond is between 1 and 6, the structure isn't symmetric. Because position 2 is D, which is next to position 1, while position 6 is next to position 5, which is H. So, the two ends (1 and 6) are not equivalent.

Therefore, attack at position 1 and position 6 would lead to two different products.

So, the possible products are:

1. 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.

2. 6-amino-2-deutero benzene.

But wait, could there be any other products? For example, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or 5, leading to elimination and forming a triple bond elsewhere.

Wait, but elimination requires the abstracted H to be adjacent to the leaving group (Br). So, only positions adjacent to Br can undergo elimination. Thus, only position 6 is available for elimination because position 2 is D, not H.

So, only one elimination pathway, leading to the triple bond between 1 and 6.

Then, the two possible substitution sites (positions 1 and 6) would lead to two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but through some other mechanism, leading to only one product.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction results in the formation of a benzene ring without the Br and with a new substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by an amino group. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But for that to happen, the ring would need to undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But with Br being a moderate deactivating group, the ring isn't sufficiently activated for that to occur without some assistance.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is strong enough to induce elimination rather than substitution. So, the reaction forms the benzyne intermediate, which then can react with the amide ion.

So, putting it all together, the possible products are 1-amino-2-d and 6-amino-2-d benzene. Thus, two possible products.

Wait, but another possibility: when the benzyne is formed, it could lose a hydrogen and form a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the base could deprotonate in a way that leads to a different substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps when the benzyne is formed, it could undergo a ring expansion, but I don't think that's likely.

So, considering all the possibilities, I think there are two possible products.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The compound has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction likely proceeds via a benzyne intermediate. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - The strong base NaNH₂ abstracts a proton from a position ortho to the bromine (position 6, since position 2 is deuterated and cannot be abstracted).  
   - This abstraction leads to the formation of a carbanion at position 6, followed by the departure of the bromine atom as Br⁻.  
   - This results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

2. **Reactivity of Benzyne**:  
   - The benzyne intermediate is highly reactive and can react with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) in the solvent.  
   - The NH₂⁻ can attack either end of the triple bond (positions 1 or 6), leading to two possible products.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - If NH₂⁻ attacks position 1, the product is 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.  
   - If NH₂⁻ attacks position 6, the product is 6-amino-2-deutero benzene.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - The reaction produces two distinct organic products due to the regioselectivity of the attack on the benzyne intermediate.
