Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let's take it step by step. 

The problem describes a series of reactions. Let's break down each reaction and see what we can deduce about the substances involved.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests that the molar ratio is 1:8. I'm thinking, what solid reacts with a gas in such a ratio? Maybe something like metal and a diatomic gas. Wait, 8 equivalents could imply that gas B is being used in a high stoichiometric ratio. For example, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen like Cl2 or Br2. But wait, 8 equivalents would mean that each mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B, which is a lot. That might suggest something like a metal reacting with a diatomic molecule. Oh, wait! Maybe A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2). Then, Na reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl. But wait, sodium has a +1 charge and Cl is -1. So in that case, the reaction would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 1:8. Hmm, maybe another combination. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is iron (Fe) and B is sulfur (S8). Iron and sulfur react to form FeS or FeS2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Or maybe A is copper and B is sulfur? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like O2. Like, maybe A is a metal reacting with O2 to form an oxide. But again, how many equivalents would that be? Let me think. For example, sodium oxide: 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. That's 2 Na to 1 O2, so 2 equivalents. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The product C is bright red. That's a key clue. What compounds are bright red? I remember that some transition metal compounds have intense colors. For instance, lead(II,IV) oxide is bright red. Or maybe it's something like mercury(II) oxide, but that's red as well. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfide, like PbS which is dark brown, not red. Wait, maybe a different oxide. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound like Fe(OH)3, but that's
