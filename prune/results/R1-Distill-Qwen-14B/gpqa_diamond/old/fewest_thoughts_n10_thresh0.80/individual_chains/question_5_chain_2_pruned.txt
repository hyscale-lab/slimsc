Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

The question is about a muon's quantum mechanical operator, specifically the vector P. The direction is along an arbitrary vector n in the x-z plane. I remember that when dealing with angular momentum, the operator along a specific direction is given by the dot product of the vector operator and the unit vector. So, the operator P along direction n would be P · n, where n is in the x-z plane.

Wait, the components of P are given. Let me see: Px is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So, that's like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i,0), which is the Pauli Y matrix times ħ/2. Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix times ħ/2.

So the vector operator P is made up of these components. Now, the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, no, the operator we're considering is P · n, right? Because the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says, "calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n..." Oh, wait, so the operator is P_n = P · n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

So, n is in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ)? Wait, no, wait. If it's in the x-z plane, then the y-component is zero. So n would be (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n can be parametrized as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, or is it from the x-axis? Hmm. Let's think: in standard spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if it's in the x-z plane, φ (the azimuthal angle) would be 0. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ)? Or wait, no, if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the x-component would be sinθ cosφ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ=0, so x-component is sinθ, and z-component is cosθ.

Wait, no, if the direction is in the x-z plane, the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because when θ=0, n is (0,0,1) along z. When θ=90 degrees, n is (1,0,0) along x.

So, the operator P along direction n is P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n_y is zero (as n is in the x-z plane), that term drops out. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n_x is sinθ and n_z is cosθ.

So, substituting the matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P_n = (sinθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix:

First term: (ħ/2) sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Second term: (ħ/2) cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding them together:

The matrix becomes:

[[ (ħ/2 cosθ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
 [ (ħ/2 sinθ), (-ħ/2 cosθ) ] ]

Because the (1,1) element is (ħ/2 cosθ), (1,2) is (ħ/2 sinθ), (2,1) is the same as (1,2) because of the symmetric terms, and (2,2) is - (ħ/2 cosθ).

Now, we're looking for the eigenv
