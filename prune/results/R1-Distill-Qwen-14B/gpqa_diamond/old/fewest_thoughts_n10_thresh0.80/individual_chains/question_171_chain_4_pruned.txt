Okay, so I've got this question here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating and whether it's an ortho/para director or a meta director.

The question gives me six different benzene derivatives, and I need to figure out the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for each when they undergo bromination. So, the goal is to arrange them from the one with the least para product to the one with the most.

Let me list out the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3 → methyl group
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → ethyl ester (since COO is part of it, I think it's COOEt)
3) C6H5-Cl → chlorine atom
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitro group
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethyl group (maybe it's ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH → carboxylic acid group

Wait, let me clarify each substituent.

1: Methyl is an activating group, ortho/para director.
2: The substituent is an ester group (COOEt). Esters are electron-withdrawing by the inductive effect but can be electron-donating through resonance? Wait, no, esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So they are meta directors.
3: Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating because it's more electronegative. So it's a meta director? Wait, no. Wait, chlorine is a deactivating, ortho/para director. Because the inductive effect is stronger than the resonance donating. So Cl is ortho/para but deactivating.
4: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta director. So nitro groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position.
5: Ethyl group is similar to methyl; it's an activating, ortho/para director. So ethyl is activating (since it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons via induction), so it directs ortho and para.
6: Carboxylic acid group (COOH) is a strong deactivating group because of the two electronegative oxygens. So it's a meta director.

Wait, but wait: the substituents' effect on bromination. The question is about the position where bromine adds.

The para-isomer's yield is influenced by the substituents. So, if a substituent directs the electrophile to para, then that substituent will increase the para product.

Wait, but for each substituent, what's the major product for bromination? Let's go one by one.

Substance 1: Methyl group. Activating, ortho/para director. So major products are ortho and para. Since it's a strong activating group, the reaction is more favored. For monobromination, the major products would be ortho and para, with para being more substituted in the case of multiple possible positions. Wait, but benzene has symmetry. For methylbenzene (toluene), the para product is major, and ortho is minor, I think. Or is it the opposite? Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, in toluene's bromination, the para isomer is major, but sometimes the ortho can also be significant. Alternatively, I recall that the para isomer is usually more substituted because of steric hindrance in the ortho position. So for a substituent that's ortho/para, the para product is more favored because it's less hindered.

Substance 2: Ethyl ester group (COOEt). This is a deactivating, meta director. So the incoming Br+ would add in the meta position. So the para product would be minor. So this substance would have a low para yield. Wait, but what's the structure? If the substituent is at a certain position, meta would be the major product. So this would mean that in this case, para isomer is not the main product.

Substance 3: Cl substituent. Deactivating, ortho/para director. So the Br would go to ortho and para. But because the ring is deactivating, the reaction is slower than benzene. But for the substituent's directing, the major products are ortho and para. Now, between ortho and para, which is more? I think in the case of Cl, the para isomer is more stable, but perhaps more likely to form because of steric factors. Alternatively, I remember that with Cl as a substituent, the para product is major.

Substance 4: Nitro group. Strongly deactivating, meta director. So the Br adds in the meta position, meaning the para product is not formed; minimal para isomer. So this would have a low para yield.

Substance 5: Ethyl group. Similar to methyl, activating, ortho/para director. So major products are ortho and para. Like toluene, para is major.

Substance 6: Carboxylic acid group. Strongly deactivating, meta director. So Br adds in meta positions. So para is not the major product here. So this would have low para yield.

Wait, but wait. For each substituent, the para product's weight fraction is determined by the directing effect. Some substituents have a strong preference for para, others for ortho. Also, some substituents may result in the para product being the major or minor.

Wait, but for each substituent, how much para product is formed?

Let me think again:

1) Methyl: ortho/para, with para major. So high para yield.

2) COOEt: meta director, so Br adds meta. So para is minor. So low para.

3) Cl: ortho/para, but Cl is a deactivating group. So the para product is more than meta, but less than the case for activating groups. So perhaps higher than meta, but lower than methyl or ethyl.

Wait, but wait. For Cl substituent, the para product is more than meta, but less than the case for activating groups. Wait, Cl is a meta director? No, Cl is ortho/para. Oh, right, because Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So the para product is possible but perhaps not as dominant as in the case of activating groups.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: for substituent effects.

Electrophilic substitution: the substituent directs the incoming electrophile. So for each substituent, the para product's relative yield depends on the substituent's directing.

So, the substituent's effect:

- Activating groups (like -CH3, -C2H5, -OH, -NH2) are ortho/para directors. So para product is possible, and the yield depends on where the substituent is.

Wait, but in the case of mono-substituted benzene, each substituent directs the incoming group to either ortho, meta, or para positions.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is in one position. For example, if the substituent is at position 1, then the ortho positions are 2 and 6, meta are 3 and 5, and para is 4.

So the substituent directs the incoming group to ortho (2,6), meta (3,5), or para (4). 

So, the substituent's nature determines where the incoming group will be.

So, for each substituent:

1. Methyl (activating, ortho/para): major products are ortho and para. But due to steric hindrance, para is more favored. So in this case, the para product is major.

2. COOEt (ester) (deactivating, meta): the major product is meta. So para is minor.

3. Cl (deactivating, ortho/para): so the product can be ortho or para. But since the ring is deactivating, the reaction is slower. But the substituent directs to ortho and para. Now, which is more? I think in Cl's case, the para product is major because meta isn't an option. Wait, no, the substituent is ortho/para. So in the case of Cl, the incoming group can go ortho, meta (no, meta isn't the case for Cl), no, wait, Cl is ortho/para. So for substituent at position 1, Br can go to 2,4,6.

But in terms of major product, perhaps para (position 4) is favored because of less steric hindrance compared to ortho (positions 2 and 6). So Cl directs to ortho and para, so para is major.

4. NO2 (deactivating, meta): so Br adds in meta positions (3 and 5), so para (4) is not a major product.

5. C2H5 (ethyl, activating, ortho/para): similar to methyl, so Br adds ortho and para. Para is more favored, so major product is para.

6. COOH (deactivating, meta): so Br adds meta. So para is minor.

So now, I need to arrange the substituents based on the weight fraction of para-isomer from least to most.

Let me list each substituent and their para yield:

1: High (para major)
2: Low (meta major, so para is minor)
3: Medium (since Cl is ortho/para but deactivating, so para is a major product but perhaps less than activating groups)
Wait, but Cl is deactivating. So the para product is possible, but the overall reaction is slower. But when considering the substituent's directing, the para is a possible product. So for Cl, the para product is significant.

Wait, but substituents that are ortho/para directors will have the para product as a major product. So for Cl (substance 3), the para product is major, but the reaction is slower due to being deactivating.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, how much of the product is para.

Wait, for substance 2 (COOEt), the substituent is meta-directing, so the para product is minor.

Similarly, substance 6 (COOH) is meta-directing, so para is minor.

So now, the para product's yield for each:

1) High

2) Low

3) High (but Cl is deactivating, so para product is present but perhaps not as high as in activating groups. Wait, but the substituent directs to para as a possible position, but the ring is deactivating so the reaction is slower, but the directing is still ortho/para.)

Wait,
