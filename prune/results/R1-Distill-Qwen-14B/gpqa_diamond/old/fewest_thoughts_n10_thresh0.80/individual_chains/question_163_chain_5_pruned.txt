Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and solutions can get tricky. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we have to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do this. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D with various pH values and volumes.

Alright, first, I think I should figure out the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 because I have the mass given as 0.1 grams. Let me compute that. Iron's atomic mass is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and Hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 has Fe (55.85) + 3*(O + H) = 3*(16 + 1) = 3*(17)=51. So total molar mass is 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check that. Fe is 55.85, each OH group is 17 g/mol, and there are three, so yes, 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Next, how many moles of Fe(OH)3 do we have? Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Hmm, so roughly 9.36e-4 moles.

Wait, actually, let me compute it more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85. Let me do that division. 0.1 divided by 100 is 0.001, but since 106.85 is a bit more, it'll be a bit less. Let's see, 106.85 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.1, so that's correct.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl (since it's monobasic and strong), it should undergo a neutralization reaction. The reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, let me write that equation properly. The acid is monobasic, so it donates one H+. So the acid (like HCl) would supply H+ ions. The reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

Wait, that makes sense. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of HCl.

So moles of HCl needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 0.000936 mol, so HCl needed is 0.002808 mol.

But wait, the concentration of the HCl is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration.

So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but the options don't have 28.08 exactly. Let me look: option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. But wait, maybe I should be more precise with my calculations.

Wait, let me redo the initial moles calculation precisely. 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol = ?

Let me compute 0.1 / 106.85. Let me calculate 106.85 * 0.000936 = 0.1?

Wait, 106.85 * 0.000936 = 106.85 * 936e-6 = (100 * 936e-6) + (6.85 * 936e-6) = (93.6e-3) + (6.85*0.000936). Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.1 / 106.85.

Let me do it step by step.

106.85 = approx 1.0685e2.

0.1 / 106.85 = 1e-1 / (1.0685e2) = (1e-3) / 1.0685 ≈ 0.0009357 mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.0009357 mol.

So moles of HCl needed: 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 moles.

Volume of HCl needed: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 liters = 28.07 cm³.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's probably the right volume.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution.

After adding HCl, which is a strong acid, to Fe(OH)3, we'll have a solution containing Fe³+ ions from FeCl3, and some excess H+ from the HCl.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. So when you add acid, you dissolve it. But in excess, the solution should be acidic because the acid is strong and in excess.

In this case, we're adding exactly 28.08 cm³ of HCl. Let me think about the total volume of the solution. The initial solution is 100 cm³, and we're adding 28.08 cm³, so total volume is 128.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, the question says "100 cm³ total volume." Oh, maybe I misread that. Let me check.

Wait, the question says: "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume." So the total solution volume after adding acid is 100 cm³. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because when you add the HCl, the volume might change, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the total volume remains 100 cm³. So the HCl is added to 100 cm³, but perhaps the volume is kept at 100 cm³. Hmm, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³, and then the HCl is added to that solution, making the total volume more than 100 cm³. But the problem's wording isn't entirely clear. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that after adding the acid, the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So, when we add the HCl, the total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the 100 cm³ of solution and the volume of HCl added. Wait, that can't be possible because adding HCl would increase the volume beyond 100 cm³. So maybe the problem is saying that the solution is made up to 100 cm³ after adding the acid. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the volume of the solution after all additions. So the initial solution is 100 cm³, and some of that is replaced by the HCl? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final solution volume, which includes the Fe(OH)3 dissolved in some solution, and then acid is added. But the problem is worded as "dissolve in 100 cm³ total volume." So perhaps the 100 cm³ includes all the solution, including the acid. So when we add the HCl, the total solution volume is 100 cm³. But that would mean that the HCl is added to the Fe(OH)
