Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my vector calculus, but let me try to think this through.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, volume integral of divergence... Oh right, that's Gauss's Law in vector calculus. Gauss's Law relates the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume to the flux through the surface. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, the divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

But I don't know if flux is directly required here. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the divergence first and then integrate it.

So, f is a radial vector field, which means it's only in the r-hat direction. The divergence of a radial vector field can be found using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. The divergence of f is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the component in the radial direction.

Wait, let's write that down. In spherical coordinates, for a vector field F = F_r r-hat + F_θ θ-hat + F_φ φ-hat, the divergence is (1/r²) [d(r² F_r)/dr] + (1/(r sinθ)) [d(F_θ sinθ)/dθ] + (
