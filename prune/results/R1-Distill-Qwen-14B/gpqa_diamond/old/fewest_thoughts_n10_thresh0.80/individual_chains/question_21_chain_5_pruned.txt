Alright, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The question has two parts, A and B.

First, part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. Then, part B is about which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate) will show optical isomerism.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A. I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and its attached lone pair between adjacent atoms, resulting in a change in the structure of the molecule. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, tautomerism can occur if there's an adjacent hydrogen that can shift, leading to enol forms.

Benzoquinone: Quinones are cyclic di-ketones. Benzoquinone specifically is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the ring. If they are in para positions, the structure would be something like O=C6H4-C=O. Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism?

Wait, wait. Tautomerism in quinones. I remember that para-quinones are more stable, and maybe they can't tautomerize as easily as others. Wait, but can the hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group shift? Let me think: each ketone group in benzoquinone is on a benzene ring. The ring structure is such that the carbonyl is at the para position. The adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which is spÂ² hybridized. So, if there's a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, can it tautomerize?

Wait, the structure of benzoquinone is O=C6H4-C=O. Wait, no, actually, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite
