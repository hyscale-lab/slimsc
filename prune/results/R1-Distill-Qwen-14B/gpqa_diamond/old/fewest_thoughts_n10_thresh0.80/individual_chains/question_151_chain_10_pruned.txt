Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The state of a system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in three dimensions, right? And the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has rows with specific elements. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0).

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. The options are given from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P.

Wait, but P is the observable, which is an operator. The possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues of P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. So I should find the eigenvalues of P. Let's think about what P looks like.

Matrix P is 3x3:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

I can write that as:

P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
     [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
     [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

Hmm, I should find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Alternatively, maybe I can find them by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by some symmetry. Let me think about the structure of P. It seems symmetric, so it's a Hermitian matrix, which it should be since it's an observable.

So the eigenvalues should be real. Let me try to find them.

The matrix P is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. The diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are 1/sqrt(2) in the first and third positions of each row.

Wait, maybe I can find the eigenvalues by considering the eigenvectors for this matrix. Let me think about possible eigenvectors.

Suppose I consider an eigenvector that's symmetric in some way. Let me think, for instance, if the vector has all components equal. Let's say v = [a, a, a]^T. Then, applying P to v:

Pv = [ (0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0*a ), 
        ( (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) a ),
        (0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0*a ) ]

Which simplifies to:

First component: (1/sqrt(2)) a

Second component: [ (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) ] a = (2/sqrt(2)) a = sqrt(2) a

Third component: (1/sqrt(2)) a

So, Pv = [ (1/sqrt(2)) a, sqrt(2) a, (1/sqrt(2)) a ].

If v is an eigenvector, then Pv = λ v. So each component must be λ times the corresponding component of v.

So, for the first component: (1/sqrt(2)) a = λ a → λ = 1/sqrt(2).

But the second component gives sqrt(2) a = λ a → λ = sqrt(2).

Wait, that's a problem because the same λ can't be two different values. So this vector isn't an eigenvector, as it's giving two different eigenvalues. So that approach doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's consider the possibility of eigenvalues by looking for vectors that might satisfy Pv = λ v.

Alternatively, perhaps I can observe that the matrix P is a symmetric matrix, and its structure is such that it's a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal and 1/sqrt(2) on the first off-diagonals.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the matrix is related to the Pauli matrices or something similar, but extended to 3x3. Or maybe it's a symmetric matrix that can be diagonalized by a known method.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just compute the characteristic equation. Let me write down the matrix (P - λ I):

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

[ 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, more accurately, let me compute the determinant:

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let me compute it.

The determinant D is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ) ]
+ 0 [ ... ] 

So, expanding along the first row:

D = -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] 
    - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ/sqrt(2)) - 0 ) ]
    + 0

So,

D = -λ (λ² - 1/2) - (1/sqrt(2)) ( -λ/sqrt(2) )

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ)/2

So,

D = (-λ³ + λ/2) ) + λ/2

Which simplifies to:

D = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 → -λ³ + λ

So determinant D = -λ³ + λ = 0.

Factor out λ: λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ(1 - λ²) = 0.

So, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

But the question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. Let me check if this state is normalized. The norm is the square
