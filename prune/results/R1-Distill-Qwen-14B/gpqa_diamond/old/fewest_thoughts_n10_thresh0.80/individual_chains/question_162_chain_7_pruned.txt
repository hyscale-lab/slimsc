Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, I think we're dealing with a 2-dimensional space because the metric only involves dx and dy. So it's a two-dimensional manifold.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm also recalling that in two dimensions, the pseudosphere is just a hyperbola, but maybe that's not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe the question is using pseudosphere to mean a sphere in some other context, like a surface with a specific metric.

Wait, the metric has a denominator (4 - x² - y²), which makes me think of a sphere. Because for a sphere of radius a, the metric in 2D might look like something with sqrt(a² - x² - y²) in the denominator or something. But this denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so 4 is like 2 squared. Oh, so the radius might be 2. The question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the metric is related to that.

Wait, but the metric given has a coefficient (32)/(4 - x² - y²). Let me think about the line element. If I consider
