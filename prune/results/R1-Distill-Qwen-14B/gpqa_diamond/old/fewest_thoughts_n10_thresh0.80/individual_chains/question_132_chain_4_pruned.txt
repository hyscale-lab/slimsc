Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Alright, the problem is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum has two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm, the options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene. Wait, molecular formula C10H14. Let me think about the possible structures. For a benzene ring, each substituent is probably a methyl group because each methyl is C1H3. Let me check: if there are four methyl groups on benzene, the formula would be C6H6 + 4*(CH3) → C10H14? No, wait, benzene is C6H6. Four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) → 4C and 12 H. So total would be C6+4= C10 and H6 + 12= H18. Wait, but the given formula is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I'm counting wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, each methyl is CH3. So each substitution replaces a H on benzene. So benzene has 6 H. Adding four methyl groups would replace four H's, so total H is 6 -4 + 4*3 = 6-4=2, plus 12 → 14 H. Oh, that's right. So each of the compounds is a tetramethylbenzene, perhaps? Or maybe another structure.

Wait another possibility: 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me calculate its formula. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So benzene (C6H6) plus two ethyl groups: C6 + 2*2= C10. And H: 6 + 2*5=16. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. So that's not matching. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C6H4(C2H5)2 → C6 + 2*2= C10, and H: 4 (from benzene) + 2*5=14. Oh yes, so 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14. So that's a possibility.

So the options have two compounds each with molecular formula C10H14. So the possible compounds are either tetramethyl or diethyl.

Now, looking at the NMR data: two singlets at around 6.7 ppm, 1:1 ratio. So that suggests two different aromatic protons environments, each as a singlet, each with equal intensity. The aromatic region usually has more splitting, but if the protons are equivalent, they could be singlets. Alternatively, if the substitution pattern makes all the aromatic protons equivalent, but in this case, the solution has two components each contributing their own set of aromatic protons, but perhaps in each compound, the aromatic protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, but the mixture is 1:1, so each component contributes equally. So the two singlets would each integrate for one equivalent set.

Wait, the 6.7 ppm is in the aromatic region. Singlets suggest no neighboring H's or symmetry making them equivalent. So perhaps each compound in the mixture has a set of equivalent aromatic protons that are each a singlet, and each contributes a signal.

Wait, but each of the tetramethylbenzenes would have their aromatic protons in certain positions. Let me think about each structure.

Option D is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Let me imagine their structures. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the positions are 1,2,4,5. So the ring would have methyl groups at adjacent positions 1 and 2, then another adjacent pair at 4 and 5. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so 1,2,4,5 would be positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. So if I number the ring, 1,2,4,5 would be two adjacent pairs. Wait, but 4 is next to 5, which is next to 1. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's a more symmetric structure.

Alternatively,
