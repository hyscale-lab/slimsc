Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again. It says that four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each with different combinations.

Hmm, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula I know is E_n = (n²) * (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. So E here is the base energy unit, which is E_1. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, E_4 is 16E, and so on.

But wait, the particles are identical and of spin-1/2. That means they are fermions, right? Because fermions have half-integer spin, and identical fermions must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in a system. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a one-dimensional infinite well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since we have spin-1/2, each particle can have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each n, we can have two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but in this problem, all particles are spin-1/2, and the well is one-dimensional. So the spatial wavefunction must consider the exclusion principle. The particles are fermions, so their total wavefunction (which is the product of spatial and spin parts) must be antisymmetric.

But since the well is 1D, the spin part can be either symmetric or antisymmetric. However, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So when considering the spatial part, if the spin part is symmetric, the spatial part must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.

But wait, perhaps a simpler way is to think about the maximum number of fermions that can occupy each energy level. For each energy level n, how many particles can we have? Since each n can have two spin states, each n can hold two particles.

So with four identical spin-1/2 particles, we need to distribute them into the lowest possible energy levels, considering that each level can hold two particles.

Wait, but since they are fermions, you can't have more than two particles in the same spatial state (same n). So for four particles, we'll fill the lowest possible n with two each, but maybe not. Let me think.

The ground state would be the lowest possible arrangement. Let me list the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = E
n=2: E_2 =4E
n=3:9E
n=4:16E
n=5:25E
n=6:36E
n=7:49E
n
