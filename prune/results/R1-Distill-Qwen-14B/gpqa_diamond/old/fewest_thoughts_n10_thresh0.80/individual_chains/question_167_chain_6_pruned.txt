Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So, it's a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). Oh right, because when you have a superposition of coherent states, the normalization comes from their inner product.

The question gives phi as -pi/4 and alpha as 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity nG using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the non-Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are those like coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. The cat states are definitely non-Gaussian, being superpositions of two coherent states.

So, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of the closest Gaussian state. Because for Gaussian states, the entropy is known, and the relative entropy quantifies the distance in terms of information.

But wait, I think there's a catch here. The formula given is the difference in entropies. So, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). But the relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(tau). So that makes sense.

The problem is to compute this for the given state. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should find the density matrices rho and tau. Rho is easy: rho = |psi><psi|. For tau, the reference Gaussian state, I'm not exactly sure which Gaussian state to take as reference. Because the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity could depend on that.

Wait, wait. For a state that's a superposition of two coherent states, the closest Gaussian state would be the thermal state or maybe another Gaussian that minimizes the relative entropy. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed state, but that doesn't make much sense in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state when phi is zero or something like that. Wait, no. Because when phi is zero, the state becomes |alpha>, which is a Gaussian state. Similarly, when phi is pi/2, it's | - alpha> normalized. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state when the superposition becomes a single coherent state, which would be either |alpha> or |-alpha> depending on phi.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the state that the non-Gaussian state would collapse into if it were Gaussian. Hmm. This is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is defined as S(rho||tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. But finding that tau might be non-trivial.

Alternatively, for the given state, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that is the mixture of the two coherent states without the phase, but that's not quite right.

Wait, another approach: the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. So, when phi is varying, the state changes. For phi =0, it's |alpha> normalized, which is Gaussian. Similarly, phi = pi/2, it's |-alpha> normalized, so Gaussian again. So, the non-Gaussianity arises when phi is such that the state is a superposition, like phi=pi/4.

Wait, but in this problem, phi is given as -pi/4. So the state is cos(-pi/4)|alpha> + sin(-pi/4)|-alpha> all divided by N. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>)/N.

But what would N be? Let's compute N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2 alpha²)).

phi is -pi/4, so 2*phi is -pi/2. So sin(2*phi) is sin(-pi/2) which is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-0.5). So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5)).

Wait, exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 = 0.
