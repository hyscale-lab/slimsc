Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem again and see what it's asking.

The problem says: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4●2H2O. The molecular weights (Mw) are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4●2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. We're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.

Hmm, okay. I remember that orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- right? But wait, I think the different KAs are for the successive dissociations of H3PO4. So H3PO4 can lose protons in three steps. Let me recall:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are the sodium and potassium salts of phosphate. Let me figure out what ions they produce.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But the question asks for the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the orthophosphate ion.

Wait a minute, in solution, the phosphate species can interconvert based on pH. So the species present depend on the pH of the solution. Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is probably a buffer. But how do I find the concentration of PO4^3-?

I think the key here is to consider the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. Because HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3- according to the third dissociation.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation constant, Ka3. But wait, I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution. But how?

Wait, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So it's a
