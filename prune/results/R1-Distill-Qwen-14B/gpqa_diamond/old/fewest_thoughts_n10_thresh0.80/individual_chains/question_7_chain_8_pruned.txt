Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the process gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. I remember that the CMB has an average photon energy, which is given as 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, I think this has to do with photon-photon interactions. High-energy gamma rays can interact with CMB photons. But how does that limit the gamma-ray's lifetime? Oh right, because when they interact, they get annihilated, so their number density decreases. So the lifetime would be determined by the rate of such annihilation processes.

I think this involves calculating the interaction cross-section and the number density of the CMB photons. The formula for the mean free path or the interaction probability would come into play here. 

The process is gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-. The cross-section for this process probably depends on the energy of the gamma-rays and the CMB photons. But wait, the CMB photons are at a much lower energy, so maybe the gamma-rays are the high-energy ones here.

I remember that for photon-photon interactions, the cross-section increases as the energy squared or something like that. Also, the optical depth, which is the product of the cross-section and the number density of target photons, multiplied by the distance traveled, determines whether the interaction is significant.

The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited when the interaction probability becomes significant. So, the condition is that the optical depth is about 1, meaning that the probability of interaction is around 1.

Let me think about the formula. The optical depth τ is given by σ * n_target * L, where σ is the cross-section, n_target is the number density of target photons, and L is the path length.

But wait, in cosmology, we often assume that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, so maybe the relevant quantity is the critical density or something. Alternatively, the CMB photon density is known. The number density n of CMB photons is about 411 photons per cm³, but let me calculate it properly.

The CMB has a temperature T, and the number density of photons is n = (g * T^3)/(h^3 c^3) * something. Wait, the formula for photon number density is n = (8π g / (h^3 c^3)) ) * ∫ E^2 ... Wait, no, more accurately, the number density of photons in a blackbody spectrum is given by n = (g * ζ(3/2) * (k_B T)^3 ) / (h^3 c^3)}, where ζ is the Riemann zeta function. Oh wait, ζ(3/2) is approximately 2.612. 

But I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, I remember that the number density n is about 1e8 photons per cubic meter. Wait, converting that to per cm³, that's 1e8 per m³ = 1e8 / (1e6 cm)^3 = 1e8 / 1e18 = 1e-10 cm^-3. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I have the numbers wrong.

Wait, I think the CMB photon density is about 411 cm^-3. Because for T = 2.7 K, the photon density is n ~ 0.25 * (T/1 K)^3 * 1e6 cm^-3. Wait, let me compute it. The formula is n = (8π) (k_B T)^3 / (h^3 c^3) * (g), where g is the number of degrees of freedom for photons. For photons, g=2, but since each photon has two polarizations, but wait, wait, no: the formula for number density is n = (8 π^5 k^3)/(15 h^3 c^3) ) * T^3. Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact value.

Wait, I think the standard number density is about 411 photons per cm³. So n ~ 4e2 cm^-3. So that's 411 per cm³.

Now, the cross-section for the gamma-photon interaction. The cross-section for two photons (gamma and CMB photon) producing an electron-positron pair. I think the cross-section formula for photon-photon to e+ e- is given by:

σ = (8 π α^2 / (3 s)) (1 + 2 m_e^2 / s) * [ (something) ]

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty here. Alternatively, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into pairs is given by σ = (8π α²/(3 s)) (1 + (2 m_e²)/s), where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. Because each photon has energy E1 and E2, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2. But wait, when one photon is high energy and the other is low (like the CMB photon), s ≈ 4 E1 E2, because in the limit where E1 >> E2, s ≈ (E1 + E2)^2 ≈ (2 E1)^2 =4 E1^2. But wait, the other way: when one photon is much higher energy than the other, then E1 ≈ E, E2 ≈ k T << E. So s ≈ (E + E2)^2 ≈ E^2 (since E >> E2), but wait, that's not correct. Let me think: in the rest frame of the CMB photon, the energies would be E' = (E + E2) / (1 + (E E2)/(E c^2)) ), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, since E2 is much smaller than E, s ≈ (E + E2)^2 ≈ E² (since E >> E2). Hmm, perhaps I should better model this.

Wait, s is (E1 + E2)^2. If one photon is high energy (E) and the other is low (E2 = E_cmb ≈ 1e-3 eV), then in the lab frame (where E2 is low), E1 + E2 ≈ E, so s ≈ (2 E)^2 = 4 E², but wait, that's not right because E2 is much smaller than E. So no, perhaps s ≈ (E + E2)^2 ≈ E² + 2 E E2 + E2² ≈ E² (1 + 2 E2/(E) ). Hmm, but if E >> E2, then s ≈ (2 E)^2 =4 E²? Wait, no. Because E1 = E and E2 is about E_cmb. So E1 + E2 = E + E2 ≈ E (1 + E2/E). So s ≈ (E)^2 (1 + 2 E2/(E)) )² approximating (1 + x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x for small x. So s ≈ E² (1 + 2 E2/E) = E² + 2 E E2.

Wait, but perhaps for the cross-section, the dominant term comes from the s-channel process, which is when the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) = E1 + E2 ≈ E when E1 >> E2.

But perhaps the cross-section is given by σ ≈ (8 π α^2)/(3 s) [ ... ], but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I think that the cross-section for two-photon annihilation into e+ e- is given by:

σ = (8 π α²)/(3 s) * (1 + 2 m_e²/s) * (4/s) )?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of this another way. The cross-section for γγ → e+ e− has a certain dependence on the energy. For high energies (E >> m_e c²), the cross-section goes as σ ~ 1/s, because the dominant contribution comes from the t-channel (Bhabha scattering) and s-channel (Møller scattering) processes. Wait, but I'm mixing up processes here. Alternatively, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e− is given by the sum of s-channel (photon-photon via a virtual photon or Z) and t/u-channel (electron exchange). 

But perhaps for high-energy photons, the dominant contribution comes from the s-channel, and the cross-section is:

σ ≈ (8 π α²)/(3 s) (1 + 2 m_e²/s )

Where s = (E1 + E2)^2, E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons. Since the CMB photon has E2 = k_B T ≈ 1e-3 eV, and E1 is the high-energy gamma-ray, so E1 >> E2, then s ≈ (E1 + E2)^2 ≈ (E1)^2 (1 + 2 E2/(E1) ) etc. But for high E1, E2 is negligible, so s ≈ (E1)^2.

Wait, but wait, the CMB photon has E2 = k_B T. For T=2.7 K, E2 ≈ 0.001 eV, as given.

So when E1 >> E2, s ≈ E1². So the cross-section becomes σ ≈ (8 π α²)/(3 E1²) (1 + 2 m_e²/(E1²) ) 

But for high E1, the term 2 m_e²/(E1^2) is negligible, so σ ≈ (8 π alpha^2)/(3 E1^2 )

But wait, I also remember that the cross-section for pair production off the CMB is approximately σ ≈ (8 π alpha^2)/(3 s) * (1 + 2 m_e²/s ), but for s >> m_e^2, it's just (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 s )

Now, the cross-section also depends on the energy. So putting this together.

The interaction rate (luminosity) is given by the product of the cross-section and the number of target photons, and the flux of the gamma-ray. But perhaps the relevant quantity is the optical depth.

The optical depth τ is given by:

τ = n_target * σ * L 

where n_target is the number density of target photons (CMB), σ is the cross-section, and L is the path length.

But the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited when the optical depth τ is about 1, meaning that on average, the gamma-ray would interact once.

So, τ ≈ 1.

So,

n_target * σ * L ≈ 1

But L is the distance the gamma-ray travels. The age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, which is roughly 4e17
