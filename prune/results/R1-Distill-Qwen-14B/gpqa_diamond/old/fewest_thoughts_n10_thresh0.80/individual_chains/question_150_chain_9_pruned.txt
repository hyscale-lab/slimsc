Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, so I'll start by analyzing that to find out the structure of the starting material. Then, I'll look at the reaction steps and see what transformations occur to determine the final product.

First, the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that: (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe an ester or something else (another 1?), but I'm not sure yet. Wait, no, better to count each component: each ring or double bond is one, each triple bond is two, each ring plus double bond would add up. So 5 could be a benzene ring (3) plus a double bond and a ring? Or maybe a benzene ring and two double bonds. Alternatively, a benzene and an amide group which has a double bond. Not sure yet, but let's look at the NMR.

The 1H NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. High chemical shift, around 9.7, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the structure has an aldehyde group.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, probably from a para-substituted aromatic ring, like two protons ortho to a substituent. So maybe a substituted benzene where two protons are in a para position. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. Maybe another pair of protons in an aromatic ring, perhaps para to substituents. Wait, but the first peak was 6.98 and this is 6.51. Maybe they're from two different aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps this is a substituent on another ring.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchange or maybe an enol proton, but 2H in a singlet. Maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group adjacent to something else. Or perhaps it's para to an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group, but the formula has NO, not nitro. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So one N. Maybe an amide group? Or perhaps an aromatic amine.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, 2H. Integration is 2H, so maybe a CH2 group attached to something. The shift is around 3.6, which is typical for a CH2 next to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an OCH2- group. Or maybe adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Putting this together, the structure probably has an aromatic ring (like benzene), an aldehyde group, maybe another aromatic substituent, and some other groups like an oxygen-containing substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 is an aldehyde. Then, perhaps the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, suggesting two para-substituted benzene rings. Wait, but the integrals are 2H each for 6.98 and 6.51, so maybe two different aromatic rings, each substituted in such a way that their protons are split into doublets. Hmm, that could be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an aldehyde with two substituted benzene rings attached via a chain. Let me think. Maybe it's something like diphenylbutanal or similar.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That could be a CH2 group attached to something. If the aldehyde is at one end, maybe the CH2 is part of a chain.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. Suppose we have a benzaldehyde group (PhCHO). Then, maybe another substituent on the benzene ring. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O, so the remaining would be C1H3N. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has two benzene rings connected via a chain with an aldehyde.

Wait, the starting molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me see the possible structures with that.

Another approach: perhaps it's an aromatic aldehyde with substituents and an oxygen atom. The aldehyde group (CHO) is present, as indicated by the 9.72 ppm peak.

The 3.66 ppm doublet is 2H. Maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2- something. If the structure has a CH2-O group, perhaps as part of a chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ortho-substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aldehyde attached to a benzene ring, which is further attached to another ring via a chain. Let me think of the molecular formula: C8H9NO. So 8 carbons. One could be the aldehyde (CHO), one benzene ring (6 carbons?), but wait, benzene is 6 carbons, then perhaps the aldehyde is on the benzene, and the chain is more carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-(benzyl)butanal or something like that. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a substituted butyraldehyde with two phenyl groups.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons. Let me count the protons. The two doublets (each 2H) account for 4 aromatic protons. So maybe two benzene rings, each with two protons. Since each doublet is 2H, and each benzene has two protons, perhaps each ring is para-substituted, leading to two equivalent protons each. So each ring has a substituent in the para position, making the protons into a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring is a substituent on a central structure.

Wait, let's think about the coupling. The triplet at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) suggests that the aldehyde proton is next to two equivalent protons. But aldehyde protons usually don't have adjacent protons because they're at the end of the chain. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde where the aldehyde is attached to a ring that has adjacent protons, like a cyclopropane or something, but that
