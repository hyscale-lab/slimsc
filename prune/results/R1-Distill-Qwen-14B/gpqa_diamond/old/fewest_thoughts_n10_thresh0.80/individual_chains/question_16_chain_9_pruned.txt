Okay, I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, I remember that a compound is optically active if it has a chiral center, meaning it has four different groups attached to a carbon atom. Alternatively, some molecules can have other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain rings, but I think most of these examples might be from chiral centers.

Let's look at each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Structure: I think this is an alkene with substituents on the first carbon. The formula is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3). Wait, no, wait. For but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure should be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon of the double bond. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl on the first carbon, a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe Cl is on the same carbon as the double bond. So the compound is (Z)-configuration.

Wait, no. The compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to
