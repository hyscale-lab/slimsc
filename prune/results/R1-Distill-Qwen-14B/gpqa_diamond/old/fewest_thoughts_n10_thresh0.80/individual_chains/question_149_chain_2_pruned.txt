Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this NMR and LC-MS question. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the scenario is that I've synthesized a small peptidic compound, and I'm analyzing it using 1H NMR and LC-MS. The NMR shows most of the peaks as expected, except for two peaks that are both alpha-proton signals. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass, consistent with the expected molecule.

Hmm. So, what could cause duplicate peaks in the NMR for the same alpha proton? The first thought is about diastereomers or enantiomers because those would affect the NMR. But wait, enantiomers have the same NMR spectrum because they are mirror images. If the compound is a racemic mixture, we'd see the same peaks, but the question says two peaks, so maybe it's not enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. The question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. If it's a diastereomer, the environment around the proton would be different, leading to different chemical shifts. But here the shifts are similar. Also, the same mass in LC-MS suggests that both are the same molecular weight, so maybe they're not different compounds like a byproduct or precursor.

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. That would mean another compound with a different mass. But the LC-MS shows same mass. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would show same NMR, so only one peak, not two. So B might not explain it. Unless the peaks are from the same proton in different environments, but wait, enantiomers have identical NMR. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling is when a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, but that usually leads to more splitting. For example, if a proton is next to two different groups, but I'm not sure how that leads to two separate peaks. Wait, maybe if there's some kind of diastereotopicity or if the amide formation led to different coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the amide proton
