Okay, so I've got this question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reaction of six different substances with excess bromine. Each substance is a benzene ring with a substituent. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. That means I need to determine how much of each reaction product is the para-substituted bromide, and then order them from the smallest to the largest percentage.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each a different order.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring and can also direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions (ortho, meta, para).

Each substituent has a directing effect. For example:
- Electron-donating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2) are activating and tend to direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.
- Electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2, -COOH) are deactivating and usually direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For substituents that are meta directors, the substitution tends to happen more in the meta position. So the para-isomer would be less in those cases.

But when a substituent is a strong activating group (like -OCH3), it's ortho/para directing, leading to more para substitution, perhaps.

Wait, but for each substituent, I need to consider whether it's a strong activating or deactivating group, and where it directs substitution.

Let me list each substituent and determine their directing effects.

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group (-CH3). Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the incoming bromine (electrophile) will attack at ortho, para, and maybe meta, but mainly para and ortho. But since it's a meta director for some groups? No, wait, no. Methyl is ortho/para. So substitution occurs more in para and ortho positions. But wait, in the case of a mono-substituted benzene, the substituent directs the next substitution. So for each compound, the substituent is already present, and when bromine adds in electrophilic substitution, where will it go?

Wait, but the question is about which position is predominant. Since it's an excess of Br2, it's a di-substitution? Or is it a mono-substitution? The question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," so each reaction adds one Br. Wait, but wait. The benzene already has a substituent, and bromination adds another substituent. So each of these is a benzene ring with a substituent, and bromine adds another Br. So each product is a di-substituted benzene.

Wait, but the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed". Oh, I see, each starting material has a substituent, and when brominated, they form a mono-brominated product. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says, "substances
