Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me look at each reaction step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), I remember that the usual reaction is a nucleophilic addition. But the product here has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Oh wait, so maybe it's a cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation typically involves the addition of CN- to a ketone, creating a compound with an alcohol and a nitrile group. For that, I think the reaction usually uses an acid catalyst. Like H3O+ or something similar. So in the first reaction, A is likely an acid, maybe H3O+.

The second reaction is a bit trickier. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So looking at the product, the nitrile group (CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that
