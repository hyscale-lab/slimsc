Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see... The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable P and getting a specific value. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Wait, right. So in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.

But wait, in this problem, the matrix P is given. Let me write it down to visualize it better. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P looks like this:

[ 0          1/√2         0     ]
[1/√2        0           1/√2  ]
[ 0          1/√2         0     ]

Hmm, I wonder what the eigenvalues of this matrix are. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the question is about the probability of getting zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure if zero is an eigenvalue of P. Let me check. To find the eigenvalues, I'll need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

But maybe there's an easier way. Looking at the structure of P, it's a 3x3 matrix with a certain symmetry. Maybe it has eigenvalues that are easy to find. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is related to some standard basis or has a known form.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for eigenvectors. Let me consider the rows. The first row has non-zero elements in the middle. The second row has elements 1/√2, 0, 1/√2. The third row is similar to the first.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvectors are along certain directions. Let me think: if I take a vector like (1, 0, 1), when I multiply it by P, what happens? Let's compute P multiplied by that vector.

P * [1; 0; 1] = [0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1; (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1; 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 ].

Calculating each component:

First component: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.
Second component: (1/√2)(1) + (1/√2)(1) = 2/√2 = sqrt(2) * (2/2) = sqrt(2).
Third component: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

So the result is [0; sqrt(2); 0]. So that's sqrt(2) times [0; 1; 0]. Wait, so P*(1,0,1) = sqrt(2)*(0,1,0). Hmm, that's interesting. So perhaps the vector (1, 0, 1) is an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue sqrt(2). Because P*v = sqrt(2) * v?

Wait, wait. Let me check. For (1,0,1), P*(1,0,1) equals [0; sqrt(2); 0], which is sqrt(2) multiplied by [0;1;0], not the original vector. So that's not an eigenvector. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait another approach. Maybe find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation. The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So the matrix is symmetric, which is good because it's Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ   1/√2   0 ]
[1/√2  -λ    1/√2]
[ 0    1/√2  -λ ]

To compute the determinant:

I'll expand along the first row.

det = -λ * det [ -λ   1/√2 ]
              [1/√2  -λ ]

Minus (1/√2) * det [1/√2  1/√2 ]
                   [0     -λ ]

Plus 0 * something.

Wait, let me write this correctly. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be expanded as:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:
[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So for our P - λ I, a = -λ, b=1/√2, c=0; d=1/√2, e= -λ, f=1/√2; g=0, h=1/√2, i= -λ.

So det = (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * something.

Let me compute each part.

First term: (-λ) * [ λ² - (1/2) ] → -λ (λ² - 1/2 )

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ ( -λ / √2 ) - 0 ] → -(1/√2) * ( -λ / √2 ) = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = (λ) / 2.

So the determinant is:

-λ(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2 )

Expanding:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2 ) → -λ³ + λ.

So the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² +1 ) =0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0 → λ (1-λ)(1+λ) ) =0.

So eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, so P has eigenvalues 1, -1, 0.

So the possible measurements are 0, 1, -1. The question is asking for the probability of getting 0.

So next, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each of these eigenvalues, particularly for λ=0.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. The probability is the square of the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me write this as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1 ]
     [  2 ]
     [  1 ]

So the system is in state ψ.

I think the way to find the probability is to project ψ onto each eigenvector of P and find the norm squared of the projection for the eigenvalue 0.

But first, I need to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Let's start with λ=0.

Find the eigenvectors by solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v =0.

So the system of equations is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 =0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3 )=0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as row 1 → v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). Because v1 can be any scalar, say t, then v3 = -t, and v2=0. So the eigenvector is t*(1, 0, -1).

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when I set λ=0, the equations are:

1. v2 = 0.

2. v1 + v3 = 0.

3. v2 = 0.

So yeah, v2 must be 0, and v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), up to normalization. Let me normalize it.

The norm squared is (1)^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Let me call this vector e0 = [1/√2; 0; -1/√2].

Now, the state vector is ψ = [-1; 2; 1].

The probability of measuring 0 is |<e0 | ψ>|².

Let's compute this inner product.

<e0 | ψ> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) → (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2.

The modulus squared is ( -√2 )² = 2.

Wait, but that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait wait, the state vector isn't normalized. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, meaning its norm is 1. Let's check the norm of ψ.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized; perhaps it's given as a state vector but not normalized. But when we calculate probabilities, we should normalize the state.

Wait, but in the problem, it's just given as the state. So perhaps we need to normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1.

So let's normalize ψ first.

The state vector ψ is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6).

So the normalized state vector is ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1 ].

So the state is actually |ψ> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is |<e0 | ψ> |^2.

Compute <e0 | ψ>.

e0 is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ].

So <e0 | ψ> = (1/√2)(-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/√2)(1/sqrt(6)).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1/√2)(-1/√6 ) → -1/(√2 * √6 ) = -1/(√12) = -1/(2√3).

Third term: (-1/√2)(1/√6 ) → -1/(√2 * √6 ) = same as above: -1/(2√3).

So adding them: (-1/(2√3)) + 0 + (-1/(2√3)) )= -2/(2√3) )= -1/√3.

The modulus squared is ( -1/√3 )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, but let me double-check the normalization. Because I had to normalize the state vector, but in the initial problem statement, it just gave the state as (-1, 2, 1). So when calculating probabilities, I think we have to normalize the state.

Yes, because in quantum mechanics, the state must be a unit vector, so without normalization, the probabilities would be scaled.

So the correct probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \). The state of the system is given as \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and the observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After solving, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( \mathbf{v}_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing this eigenvector gives:

\[
\mathbf{e}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the State Vector
The given state vector \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
\psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of Measuring \( 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is given by the square of the inner product between \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \) and \( \mathbf{e}_0 \):

\[
P(0) = |\langle \mathbf{e}_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle|^2.
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle \mathbf{e}_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0(2) + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}.
\]

The modulus squared is:

\[
|\langle \mathbf{e}_0 | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle|^2 = (-\sqrt{2})^2 = 2.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( 0 \) is:

\[
P(0) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Answer: C
