Okay, so I've got this science question here about a ligand-receptor pair and some genetic constructs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question describes a situation where someone has created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic means it has two coding regions (two ORFs) in one vector. So the ligand is at the 5' end, followed by the receptor at the 3'. Each of these is fused to a reporter: mCherry for the ligand, and eGFP for the receptor. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe used for expression. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRESs are internal ribosome entry sites, which allow for the translation of a second gene in a bicistronic construct without the need for a second promoter. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is presumably under the same promoter as the ligand.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes. The ligand ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, the receptor has a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. LoxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants, I think. Cre recombinase recognizes these sites and can excise the DNA between them. So, when Cre is present, it can delete the stop cassette. 

Wait, but how does the expression work? In a bicistronic setup, the first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, and the IRES drives the second ORF (receptor). So, without Cre, the stop cassettes are in place. But how does that affect expression? Oh, wait, I think the stop cassettes are between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. So, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in between. Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP but also has a stop. So, without Cre, the mCherry would be after the ligand but with a stop in between, meaning mCherry isn't expressed unless the stop is removed. Same for eGFP.

But wait, in the setup, they use a lox-Cre vector. So, when Cre is present, it would cause the stop cassettes to be excised. So for the ligand, the stop is between ligand and mCherry. Cre would cut the loxP sites, removing the stop, so ligand and mCherry would be expressed together. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop between receptor and eGFP is flanked by lox2272. So Cre would remove that stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed alongside the receptor.

But wait, the question is about mouse models. They've made a mouse that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross it with SOX
