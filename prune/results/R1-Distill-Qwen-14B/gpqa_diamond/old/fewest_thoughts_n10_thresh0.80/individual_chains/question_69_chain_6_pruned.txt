Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer when they're moving at high speeds because of time dilation. So, the lifetime observed (the dilated one) depends on the Lorentz factor gamma.

The proper lifetime is τ₀, which is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, we observe a longer lifetime. The relation is τ = gamma * tau_0.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is gamma = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass. Because for a relativistic particle, E is approximately equal to gamma m c², and since we're dealing with units where c is 1 (like in particle physics), E = gamma m. So, gamma would be E/m.

Wait, let me compute that. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, which is less than 27. 3.41 *8 is 27.28, which is a bit higher. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.915. So gamma is about 7.915.

So the observed lifetime τ is gamma * tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 s, so tau = 7.915 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that: 7.915 *8 is approximately 63.32, so tau is about 6.332e-14 seconds.

Now, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. I think this refers to the detection resolution being good enough to see the decay products. So, the particles Y and Z will travel some distance before being detected. The chamber can only detect them if their path length is within the resolution of the detector.

Wait, so the minimum resolution is the maximum distance the decay products can move before the detector can no longer distinguish them. If the detector's resolution (let's say the minimum detectable separation) is larger than the decay length, then the decay would not be observable.

So, the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is beta * gamma * c * tau_0. Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving with velocity v ≈ c (for high-energy particles), so beta ≈ 1. So, L ≈ gamma * c * tau_0.

Wait, but the observed lifetime is gamma * tau_0, so the average lifetime is tau, so the average distance is beta gamma c tau_0. But since beta is close to 1, we can approximate it as gamma c tau_0.

But wait, I think the proper formula is L = beta gamma c tau_0. Let me make sure. The proper lifetime is tau_0. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. The distance it travels is velocity * time. Velocity is beta c, time is gamma tau_0. So L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

But beta is v/c, and for high gamma, beta approaches 1. So, L ≈ gamma c tau_0.

So, let me compute L. Gamma is about 7.915, c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So, L = 7.915 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute that step by step. 3e8 * 8e-16 is 2.4e-7. Then multiplied by 7.915 gives approximately 1.9e-6 meters. Wait, wait, let me do that again.

Wait, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 8e-16 s is 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7 meters. Then multiply by 7.915: 2.4e-7 *7.915 = approximately 1.9e-6 meters, which is 1.9 micrometers or 1900 nanometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, perhaps the decay length needs to be a certain fraction of the chamber's resolution.

Wait, I've heard that the probability of a decay being observed (i.e., the decay products being detected) depends on the resolution of the detector. If the detector can't resolve the decay point accurately, then it can't tell whether the decay happened or not.

So, if the decay length is much larger than the detector's resolution, then the tracks of Y and Z would be too far apart for the detector to resolve as a two-particle decay. Alternatively, if the detector's resolution is on the same scale as the decay length, then it can pick up the decay.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Another angle: the resolution of the detector refers to the smallest distance it can distinguish between two points. So, if the decay length is smaller than the resolution, the two decay products would appear to come from the same point, making the decay harder to observe. So, to observe the decay, the decay length must be larger than the detector's resolution.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the decay length is small (like less than the resolution), the two decay particles would appear to come from the same point, making it hard to see that it's a two-body
