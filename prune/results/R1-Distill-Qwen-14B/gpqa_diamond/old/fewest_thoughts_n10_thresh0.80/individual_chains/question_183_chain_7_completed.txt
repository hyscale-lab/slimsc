Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed when a certain compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is related to the degrees of unsaturation, which counts the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule.

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw the structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The numbering would go such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 in the ring. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so that's a substituent on the ring.

So the structure: the cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO) attached, and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). Also, since it's a carboxylic acid, that's at position 1, I think. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, because the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid as position 1? Wait, no, the numbering in carboxylic acids typically starts from the carboxylic group as position 1. So in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

So the ring has a double bond (cyclohexene) at position 3, meaning between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH₂CH₂?), wait no, wait, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituents are a formyl group at position 2 and a vinyl group at position 5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but wait, maybe that's a different reaction. Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus and HI are used for the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to alkenes? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, wait, another reaction: the treatment of alkynes with red phosphorus and HI. Oh right, when an alkyne is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's called the hydroiodolysis reaction, which adds HI across the triple bond, leading to a dihalide. But wait, in this case, the molecule is a cyclohexene derivative with a vinyl group and a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with the alkyne. Wait, is the starting material an alkyne? No, the starting material is an cyclohexene (so has a double bond), and a vinyl group (another double bond). Wait, then the molecule has multiple double bonds.

Wait, let's count the degrees of unsaturation in the starting material. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X in this molecule. The formula of the starting material is important.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the structure. The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group at position 2 and a vinyl group at position 5. Wait, cyclohexenecarboxylic acid would have a double bond in the ring. So the cyclohexene is part of the molecule, and the substituents are the formyl and vinyl groups.

So the molecule has:

- A cyclohexene ring, which contributes 1 DoU (the ring is a double bond in the ring).
- The vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) contributes another DoU (the double bond in the vinyl group).
- The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's another DoU.

So the starting material has 3 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but wait. The cyclohexene has one double bond (so DoU 1), the vinyl group has another (DoU 2), and the formyl group another (DoU 3). So initial DoU is 3.

But wait, the question is about the product after reaction. So red phosphorus and excess HI. I think this is a reaction that adds HI to double bonds, possibly.

Wait, another thought: when you have a diene (two double bonds), treating with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of a dihalide. Or perhaps, in this case, the reaction is not about the cyclohexene ring but about the substituents.

Wait, the substituents are formyl (CHO) and vinyl (CH₂=CH-). The formyl group is a carbonyl, which is a ketone, but how does that react with HI and red phosphorus? I'm not sure. The vinyl group is an alkene, which would react with HI in a hydrohalogenation reaction.

Hmm, so perhaps the reaction is adding HI across the double bonds.

Wait, but red phosphorus is often used in the reaction of alkynes with HI to form vicinal diiodides. Alternatively, in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can add to alkynes.

Wait, but the starting molecule doesn't have an alkyne. Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the cyclohexene ring is not the only double bond. The molecule has the cyclohexene double bond, the vinyl group (another double bond), and the formyl group (another double bond). So three double bonds in total. So when reacted with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps each double bond reacts.

Wait, could red phosphorus and HI be causing addition to each double bond? Like, adding HI across each double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a formylation or some other substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when you treat a compound with red phosphorus and HI, you're probably undergoing some kind of deoxygenation or addition. For example, in the case of a carbonyl group, maybe it's being reduced. Wait, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI typically reduce carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group (CHO) is undergoing some reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and excess HI: I remember that in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can act as a source of iodide ions and H+.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) is an aldehyde. Maybe it's undergoing some kind of addition. The aldehyde group can react with HI in a possible addition, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of the alkenes present. The starting molecule has two alkenes: the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group. So maybe each of those is adding HI.

Wait, but then what happens after addition of HI to each double bond. Let's think step by step.

First, the cyclohexene ring (double bond) reacts with HI. Adding HI across the double bond would result in a di-substituted cyclohexane with two iodide groups. But wait, HI adds in a way that depends on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is more reactive than the vinyl group, so it reacts first.

Wait, but the vinyl group is a substituent on the ring. The substituents' double bonds can be more or less reactive depending on their position. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is an isolated double bond, which might be less reactive than a vinyl group, which is more substituted.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is a terminal double bond (CH₂=CH-), which is more reactive than the cyclohexene's internal double bond. So the vinyl group might react first.

So, the first step would be the addition of HI to the vinyl group. Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to the ring. So, when HI adds, it would add across the double bond. For a terminal alkene, HI adds in a way that the H attaches to the less substituted carbon, and I to the more substituted. So the addition to CH₂=CH-R would give CH₂I-CH₂-R, but wait, no, wait. Let me think about the addition of HI to an alkene. It's a two-step process: the H adds to one carbon, the I- to the other.

Wait, no, it's more like H+ adds to one carbon, and I- adds to the other. So for a vinyl group CH₂=CH-, which is attached to the ring, the addition of HI would give CH₂I-CH₂- (but wait, the ring is attached to one CH₂, so the structure would be CH₂CH₂-I, but that's not correct because the addition would be CH₂I-CH₂- ring? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it.

Vinyl group is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. Adding HI would add across the double bond, resulting in CH₂I-CH₂- attached to the ring. But wait, that's an alkyl iodide. So after adding HI to the vinyl group, it would become CH₂I-CH₂-R (where R is the ring). But wait, that would make the substituent a CH₂I-CH₂ group, but that's an alkyl iodide. But HI is in excess, so perhaps another reaction happens.

Wait, but the main point is that each double bond would react with HI. So the cyclohexene ring's double bond would also react with HI, adding HI across it to form a diiodide. So each of the two double bonds in the starting material (cyclohexene and vinyl) would add an HI, converting each double bond into a single bond with iodide substituents.

But wait, the starting material also has a formyl group (CHO), which is a carbonyl. How does that react with HI and red phosphorus? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the formyl group doesn't react significantly under these conditions.

Wait, another angle: when red phosphorus is used with HI, it's often for the dehydrohalogenation of dihalides. But wait, in this case, maybe the reaction is between the alkenes (the cyclohexene and vinyl) and HI.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydration. But no, HI is a strong acid, but not a typical hydrating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is opening epoxides, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to all the double bonds in the molecule. So each double bond would become a single bond with two iodide groups added.

So the starting material has three double bonds? Wait, no, the starting material has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the vinyl group. The formyl group is a carbonyl, which is a double bond as well. So that's three double bonds. So three DoU in the starting material.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recount:

- The cyclohexene ring: one double bond.

- The vinyl group: another double bond.

- The formyl group: another double bond (the carbonyl).

So total of three double bonds, which gives three DoU in the starting material.

Now, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus. If each double bond is converted into a single bond, each would release a DoU. So if all three double bonds are hydrogenated (converted to single bonds), the product would have zero DoU. But wait, wait, that's only possible if all three double bonds are saturated.

But wait, can HI add to all three double bonds? The cyclohexene, the vinyl, and the formyl carbonyl?

Wait, HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. The formyl group is a carbonyl (CHO), which can undergo addition reactions. For example, in the presence of HX (like HI), a carbonyl can undergo addition. So perhaps the formyl group would react as well.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, another thought: when red phosphorus is involved with HI and a carbonyl, perhaps it's a way to form an imine or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is converted into a CH2I group.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps the red phosphorus and HI act as reducing agents. Wait, red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. For example, in the reduction of carbonyl groups.

Wait, yes! I think that's it. Red phosphorus in HI is used to reduce carbonyl groups (like aldehydes and ketones) to alcohols. So the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2OH (a hydroxymethyl group). But wait, what about in this reaction?

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroboration reaction? No, that's with BH3. Alternatively, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, maybe the aldehyde would get converted to an alcohol. Or perhaps to a different compound.

Wait, considering that HI is a strong acid and a good source of iodide. So perhaps the aldehyde group (-CHO) would react with HI in an acid-catalyzed addition. Aldehydes can undergo nucleophilic addition with HI. For example, in the presence of H+ (from HI), the carbonyl oxygen becomes protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then, the iodide ion (I-) would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a diiodomethane intermediate, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde group is converted into a CH2I group. Because adding HI to a carbonyl group (like in a ketone) would lead to the formation of a geminal diiodide, but under certain conditions, this could lead to the reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again about the possible reaction of the formyl group with red phosphorus and HI. Another approach: red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. But in this case, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile. Alternatively, maybe it's used for the reduction of carbonyl groups.

Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can reduce aldehydes and ketones. For example, in the Clemmensen reduction, Zn(Hg)/HCl is used to reduce ketones to alkanes. But Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg). Alternatively, the Wolff-Kishner reaction uses NH2NH2 and a strong base to reduce carbonyl groups to CH2 groups. But that's not the same as red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, maybe in this case, the aldehyde group (CHO) is being reduced to CH2OH. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group is being converted to CHI2. Because when an aldehyde reacts with HI, it can form a diiodide. For example, the aldehyde group -CHO would add two iodide ions, leading to -CHI2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think: if the aldehyde reacts with HI, perhaps it would form a geminal diiodide. So CHO would become CHI2.

But then, what about the cyclohexene and vinyl groups? They would add HI across their double bonds.

So, if each double bond in the starting material reacts with HI, adding two iodides for each double bond, then the product would have all double bonds saturated.

Wait, but let me get back to the reaction. The starting material has three double bonds: cyclohexene (1), vinyl (2), and formyl (3). Each double bond would be converted into a single bond, and each would add two iodide groups. So each DoU is removed, and each double bond is converted into two single bonds with iodine attached.

Wait, but adding HI to a double bond would result in each of the two carbons in the double bond getting an H and an I, but depending on the structure, it might be more like one H and one I per carbon.

Alternatively, each double bond would add two iodide atoms. For example, a cyclohexene would become a cyclohexane diiodide.

Wait, perhaps each double bond is hydrogenated, and each addition brings two iodide groups. So, the cyclohexene would become a cyclohexane with two iodides attached, and the vinyl group would become a CH2I-CH2- group attached to the ring.

But wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. When HI adds across the double bond, it would become CH2I-CH2- attached to the ring, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

But regardless of the specifics, the main point is that if all the double bonds are converted to single bonds, the product's DoU would be zero.

Wait, but wait: the cyclohexene is a ring. If the double bond is hydrogenated, the ring remains. So the ring is a cyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring with single bonds. The ring itself doesn't contribute to DoU because it's a single ring without any double bonds. So the DoU from the ring is removed.

Wait, no, the DoU counts each ring and each double bond as one. So the cyclohexene contributes 1 DoU (a ring with a double bond). If the double bond is hydrogenated, the ring's DoU is now 0, because it's a saturated ring. But wait, a cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with all single bonds, so that's one ring. A ring counts as one DoU. So if the cyclohexene is hydrogenated, the ring (cyclohexane) still contributes one DoU as a ring.

Wait, no. Wait, the degrees of unsaturation formula counts each ring and each double bond as one. So a cyclohexane ring (no double bonds) has one DoU (as a ring). A cyclohexene (with a double bond) has two DoU: one for the ring and one for the double bond. So in the starting material, the cyclohexene has two DoU: the ring and the double bond.

Wait, wait, that's a mistake. No, the cyclohexene ring has one DoU: the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. Wait, no, the cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, so it contributes one DoU as a ring and one as a double bond, totaling two DoU.

Wait, no, the formula for DoU is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

But for a cyclohexene, the formula would be C6H10O2 (if it's a carboxylic acid). Wait, no, wait, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Let's calculate the molecular formula:

The cyclohexene ring: C6H8O2? Wait, wait, the formula of cyclohexene is C6H10. But with substituents, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of calculating the formula, I should think about the structure. The cyclohexene ring has one double bond, so that's one DoU. The ring itself as a cyclohexane would contribute one DoU. So the cyclohexene ring contributes two DoU: one for the ring and one for the double bond.

Wait, no. Because the ring without a double bond (cyclohexane) has one DoU (the ring). So if the cyclohexene has a double bond in the ring, that's an additional DoU. So the cyclohexene ring contributes two DoU: one for the ring and one for the double bond.

Then, the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) contributes another DoU (the double bond), and the formyl group (CHO) contributes another DoU (the carbonyl double bond). So total DoU in the starting material is 2 (from the ring) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) = 4 DoU? Wait, that can't be right, because earlier I thought it was three.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me redo the DoU calculation for the starting material.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Let me write the molecular formula:

The cyclohexene ring is C6H8 (since cyclohexene is C6H10; but wait, no, cyclohexene is C6H10. Wait, no, wait cyclohexene is C6H10, but when it's part of a larger molecule like this, which is a cyclohexenecarboxylic acid.

Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. But the molecule in question is a cyclohexenecarboxylic acid, which would have the formula C6H9COOH, but wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think about the structure.

The cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons in a ring, with one double bond (so that's two DoU, as the ring and the double bond). The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), which is a carbonyl group (so another DoU). Position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), which is a double bond (another DoU). The carboxylic acid group is at position 1 (assuming the numbering starts from the COOH group). So that's four DoU (ring, double bond, formyl, vinyl).

So the starting material has 4 degrees of unsaturation.

Now, when the reaction occurs with red phosphorus and excess HI, each double bond may react. How?

- The cyclohexene double bond: adding HI would convert it to a diiodide, saturating the ring's double bond. So that would remove one DoU (the double bond in the ring) but the ring itself is still present, so that's one DoU left (for the ring).

- The vinyl group's double bond: adding HI would convert it to a diiodide, removing one DoU.

- The formyl group's carbonyl: perhaps it's reduced. For example, if the formyl group is reduced to a CH₂ group, that would remove the DoU from the carbonyl.

Wait, if the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH₂OH or CH3, that would change the DoU. Let's think: CHO has a double bond (C=O), which is one DoU. If it's reduced to CH2OH, which is a single bond, that removes the DoU.

So, let me break down the reaction:

1. The cyclohexene's double bond is hydrogenated by HI, adding two iodides across the double bond. This converts the double bond into a single bond, so the ring's DoU from the double bond is removed. But the ring still contributes one DoU.

2. The vinyl group's double bond (CH₂=CH-) is hydrogenated by HI, adding two iodides across the double bond. This converts that double bond into a single bond, removing one DoU.

3. The formyl group's carbonyl (CHO) is reduced by red phosphorus and HI. The reduction would convert the carbonyl into a CH₂ group, which would remove the DoU for the carbonyl.

So, after all these reactions, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (DoU: 1 for the ring).

- The vinyl group now as a CH₂I-CH₂- group (so no double bond, removing its DoU).

- The formyl group now as CH₂ (so no double bond, removing its DoU).

Wait, but wait, the cyclohexane ring itself contributes one DoU. Are there any other rings or double bonds in the product?

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene's double bond is saturated, but the ring remains, so it contributes one DoU.

So, the product's DoU would be 1 (from the ring).

Wait, but what about any other double bonds or rings? Let me think:

- The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (so ring remains, one DoU).

- The vinyl group becomes a CH₂I-CH₂- group (no double bond, so no DoU).

- The formyl group becomes CH₂ (so no DoU).

So, the total DoU is 1.

Wait, but wait. What about the iodide substituents? Do they contribute any DoU? No, because they're single bonds.

So, the product has one DoU, which is from the cyclohexane ring.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the cyclohexane ring is also opened. How?

No, because the reaction with HI and red phosphorus is about adding across double bonds, not breaking rings. So the cyclohexane ring remains, contributing one DoU.

So the product has a cyclohexane ring (DoU 1). No other rings or double bonds.

Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) is 1, which would correspond to option A.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU), also known as degrees of unsaturation, of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The DoU is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

### Step 1: Analyze the starting material
The starting compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structure:
- A cyclohexene ring (C₆H₈) with a double bond in the ring, contributing **2 DoU** (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
- A formyl group (CHO) at position 2, contributing **1 DoU** (from the carbonyl double bond).
- A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5, contributing **1 DoU** (from the double bond).

Thus, the starting material has a total of **4 DoU**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI
The reaction conditions involve red phosphorus and excess HI, which typically lead to the following transformations:
1. **Hydrogenation of double bonds**: Each double bond reacts with HI, converting it into a single bond. This removes one DoU per double bond.
   - The cyclohexene double bond is hydrogenated, removing **1 DoU** (the double bond is saturated, but the ring remains).
   - The vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated, removing **1 DoU**.
2. **Reduction of the formyl group**: The carbonyl group (CHO) is reduced to a CH₂ group, removing **1 DoU** (the carbonyl double bond is eliminated).

### Step 3: Determine the structure of the product
After the reaction:
- The cyclohexene ring remains intact as a cyclohexane ring, contributing **1 DoU** (from the ring).
- The vinyl group is converted to a CH₂I-CH₂- group, with no double bond.
- The formyl group is reduced to a CH₂ group, with no double bond.

Thus, the product has only **1 DoU**, which comes from the cyclohexane ring.

### Final Answer:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

Answer: A
