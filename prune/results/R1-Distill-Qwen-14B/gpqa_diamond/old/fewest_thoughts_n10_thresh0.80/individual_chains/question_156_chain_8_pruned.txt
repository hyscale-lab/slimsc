Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral. The options suggest different numbers of peaks in each case.

First, I need to recall what mCPBA does. Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. 

Wait, but what about the reaction conditions after that? The first step is treatment with mCPBA, and then aqueous acid. Oh, right, acid work-up. So the epoxide would undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening.

Epoxidation of alkenes adds an oxygen bridge across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide. Let's think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5. The substituents on each carbon are higher priority groups on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene.

Wait, no. Wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. Or does it form a trans epoxide? Hmm. Let me think. The epoxidation via mCPBA is an electrocyclic ring-opening. Oh, right, it's a peracid adding across the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So the double bond's geometry (E or Z) dictates the epoxide's structure.

Wait, no. The double bond's geometry affects how the epoxide forms. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substitu
