Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But maybe that doesn't matter for this problem. Anyway, the question is about their orbital periods and some given ratios.

The given data:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So, Planet1's temp is 1.4 times Planet2's.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet2's temp is 2.3 times Planet3's.

Mass ratios:
- Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, so Planet1 is a bit more massive.
- Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3's mass.

We're supposed to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. And all have albedo 0.3, same as Earth.

Hmm. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσD²))^(1/4), but wait, more accurately, I think the formula is T = T_e = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) / (σ) )^(1/4), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_star * sqrt( (1 - a) / (16) ) * ( R_star / (2 D) )^(1/2) )^(1/2)? No, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. Let me get this right.

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * sqrt( (1 - a) / (4) ) * ( r / (1 AU) )^(-1/2 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (1 - a)/(4) ) * ( (1) / (distance in AU) )^0.5? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is derived from the balance between the incoming and outgoing radiation.

So, the power received from the star is L/(4πD²), where D is the distance. The planet reflects some of that with albedo a, so the absorbed power is (1 - a) * L/(4πD²) * π R², where R is the planet's radius. The outgoing radiation is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 4π R² σ T^4.

Setting them equal: (1 - a) * L/(4πD²) * π R² = 4π R² σ T^4.

Simplifying, (1 - a) L / (4 D²) ) = 4 σ T^4.

So, T^4 = ( (1 - a) L ) / (16 σ D² ) )

Take the fourth root: T = [ ( (1 - a) L ) / (16 σ D² ) ]^(1/4 )

But wait, the L and σ are constants for a given star, assuming same star for all planets. But wait, wait—no, the problem doesn't specify if the stars are same. Oh wait, but the problem is about three exoplanets, so I think they orbit the same star. So L (star's luminosity) is same for all, and albedo is same (0.3 for all). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). Because:

T ∝ sqrt( (1 - a)) ) * ( L )^(1/4) ) / ( D^(1/2) )

But since L and (1 - a) are same for all, T is inversely proportional to D^0.5.

So, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D). Or D ∝ 1/(T^2).

So, the ratio of D for Planet1 and Planet2 would be (T2 / T1)^2, because D1/D2 = (T2/T1)^2.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me write T1 and T2:

T1 = k / sqrt(D1)
T2 = k / sqrt(D2)

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, no: If T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1, and D1 is its orbital distance, then T1 = (some constant) / sqrt(D1). So if T2 is the temperature of Planet2, then T2 = same_constant / sqrt(D2).

Dividing T1 by T2: T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, so D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2.

So, for Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is T1/T2 = 1.4. So, (T1/T2) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

So, D2 = 1.96 D1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3 = 2.3. So, T2 = 2.3 T3.

So, T2/T3 = 2.3 → D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.

So, D3 = 5.29 D2.

But we already have D2 = 1.96 D1. So, D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1.

Let me calculate that. 5.29 * 1.96. Let's see:

5 * 1.96 is 9.8.

0.29 * 1.96: approx 0.5684.

So total approx 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684.

So D3 is approximately 10.37 times D1.

Wait, but we want the ratio of orbital periods, Period3 / Period1.

I remember that Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So, (P^2) ∝ D^3.

Assuming same star, the mass of the star is the same, so P^2 ∝ D^3.

So, (P3 / P1)^2 = (D3 / D1)^3.

We have D3/D1 ≈ 10.37.

So, (P3/P1)^2 = (10.37)^3.

Let me compute 10.37 cubed.

10^3 is
