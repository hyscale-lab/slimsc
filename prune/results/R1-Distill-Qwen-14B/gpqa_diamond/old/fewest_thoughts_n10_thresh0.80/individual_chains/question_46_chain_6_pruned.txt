Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene?

Hmm, okay. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs catalyst, specifically, is a transition metal carbene catalyst, often used for ring-closing metathesis or ring-opening metathesis, as well as cross metathesis.

First, let's break down the structure of the starting material. The compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, pent-1-ene has a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. The structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH2? No, wait, pentene has five carbons. So, 1-pentene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it.

Pent-1-ene: CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, wait, that's 1-pentene, right? But the compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, on the third carbon, there's a methyl group. Wait, let me count the carbons.

Let me number the pentene chain. Starting from the double bond, the first carbon is the double bond's left end. So, structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the substituent is a methyl group on C3. So, the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent means five carbons. So, 1-pentene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. When we have a 3-methyl group, that would be attached to the third carbon. So, the structure
