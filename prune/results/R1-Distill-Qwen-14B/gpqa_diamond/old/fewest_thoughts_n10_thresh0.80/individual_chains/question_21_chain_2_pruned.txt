Okay, so I'm trying to answer this chemistry question about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, let's see.

The question has two parts, A and B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, causing a change in structure. Like in ketones and aldehydes, but wait, no, that's enol tautomerism. Or in the case of compounds with adjacent double bonds or something that can shift structure.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other. Quinones can undergo tautomerism because the double bonds can shift. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure can tautomerize, I think, leading to some resonance or enol forms. But wait, wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. So if a hydrogen is adjacent, maybe it can shift. Like, the quinone structure can tautomerize to a dihydroxy structure or something like that.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring. Each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So that's like three ketones spaced around the ring. Can this compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is in a different position. Are there any hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl groups? Let me visualize the structure. Each carbonyl is on a carbon, and the adjacent carbons would be CH2 groups if it's cyclohexane. So each ketone is attached to a CH2 group. So each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl. So each CH2
