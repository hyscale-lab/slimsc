Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), I think that's a vector. The options are given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula: <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y. Oh wait, right, σ_y is given as a 2x2 matrix:

[0 -i]
[i  0]

So the state ψ is a column vector (3i, 4). Let me write that down. So ψ would be:
[3i]
[4 ]

But wait, I think spin states are usually column vectors. So ψ is (3i,4)^T. Now, to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by ψ.

Wait, ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ† is [ -3, 4i ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 becomes 4i? Wait no, wait. Wait, ψ is (3i, 4)^T. So the conjugate of 3i is -3 (since 3i's complex conjugate is -3i?), wait no, wait. Let me think. The complex conjugate of a+bi is a - bi. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so its conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i. Oh wait, so when I take the conjugate of 3i, it becomes -3i, right? So ψ† would be [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Wait, wait, no. The original vector is (3i,4). So its conjugate would change 3i to -3i, 4 to 4 (since it's real). So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]? Or wait, is ψ a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector. So yes, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait no, wait. Let me check again. The original vector is written as (3i,4). So the first component is 3i, the second is 4. The conjugate transpose (dagger) would transpose the dimensions and take the complex conjugate. So the first component becomes the conjugate of 3i, which is -3i, the second component is 4, which is real, so stays 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, but I'm not sure. Does the dagger operation transpose the vector and take the conjugate? So for a column vector ψ = [a; b], ψ† is [a*, b*] as a row vector. Oh, right. So in this case, a is 3i, so a* is -3i, and b is 4, which is real, so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now I need to compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

So let me
