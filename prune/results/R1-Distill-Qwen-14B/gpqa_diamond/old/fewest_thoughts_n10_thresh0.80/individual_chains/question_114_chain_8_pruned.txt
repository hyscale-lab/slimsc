Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question involves two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents from the given options. Let's look at each reaction and figure out what's happening.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Alright, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. When I add NaCN, I'm thinking about nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. Normally, in a ketone, the carbonyl is attacked by a nucleophile. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in the presence of an acid (since the reaction is probably in aqueous solution), the CN- would act as a nucleophile.

Wait, but acetone (butan-2-one) reacting with NaCN... I remember that the reaction of ketones with cyanide usually requires some acid catalysis. So perhaps A is an acid. Because the mechanism would involve acid catalysis. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks.

So when acetone reacts with HCN (or NaCN, which is a source of CN- and with H+ from A), it should form a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure: the acetone is (CH3)2CO. After adding HCN, the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons: butanenitrile has four carbons. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN. Hmm, no, wait, butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the nitrile is on the second carbon, along with the hydroxyl group and two methyl groups.

So the first step is nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone, acid-catalyzed. So reagent A must be an acid. The options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4 providing H+.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in such reactions, sulfites like NaHSO3 are used. For example, when you have a ketone reacting with HCN, sometimes you use a mild acid like H2SO4, or a sulfite which can act as a source of H+ and also as a nucleophile, but in this case, the product is the cyanohydrin, so maybe H3O+ is the right reagent for A.

Then moving to the second reaction:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. The nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, which is on the same carbon. So the structure is something like R-C(OH)-CN, where R is the 4-benzylphenyl group. When this is treated with reagent B in water, the CN becomes COOH.

Wait, how does a nitrile convert to a carboxylic acid? Usually, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For instance, under strong acidic conditions like H2
