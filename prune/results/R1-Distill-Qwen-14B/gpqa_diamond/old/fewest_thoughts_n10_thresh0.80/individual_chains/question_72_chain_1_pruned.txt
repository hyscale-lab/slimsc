Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The problem says that 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4, with the options being A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Wow, that's a lot of steps. I think I'll need to break this down reaction by reaction, figuring out what each step does and what the structures look like after each transformation.

Let me start with the first reaction. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I recall that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is similar to norbornene, which is a bicyclic compound. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the structure is a norbornene derivative with an oxygen substituent.

Then, it reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Wait, sodium iodide with dibromomethyl groups... that sounds like a possible substitution reaction. Dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups because Br is a good leaving group, but maybe it's more about the substitution here.

Wait, sodium iodide is often used in the formation of the iodo compound via an SN2 mechanism, especially with vicinal dihalides. Oh, wait, the starting material has two dibromomethyl groups. So perhaps this is a case of alkylation. Maybe the norbornene compound is acting as a nucleophile, attacking one of the dibromomethyl groups.

Alternatively, since the starting material is a diene, maybe it's undergoing some cycloaddition, but the presence of sodium iodide makes me think more of substitution. Let me think. If we have 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, each of the two carbons (positions 5 and 6) has a -CH2Br2 group. Wait, no, wait: 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) would mean each has a CH2 group with two bromines. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, wait, 'dibromomethyl' would be CH2Br2, but that's a bit odd because CH2Br2 is a good leaving group but perhaps more accurately, maybe it's a vicinal
