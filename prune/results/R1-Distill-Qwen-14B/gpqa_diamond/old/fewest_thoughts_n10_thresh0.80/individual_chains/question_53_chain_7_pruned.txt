Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to process the information given.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, it's an aromatic compound, probably like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have carbonyl groups, which typically absorb around 1700 cm^-1. So that's one substituent on the ring, probably an ester group.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Wait, six signals in total? Or six types of protons? I think it's six signals, each corresponding to different sets of protons.

Breaking down the NMR signals:
- Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern would determine the number of equivalent protons. If the substituents are in positions that make the aromatic protons split into two sets, like para or ortho substitution. For example, para substitution would have two equivalent H on each ring position, but wait, for di-substituted benzene, let's say two substituents in para positions. Then each pair of adjacent (ortho) H would be equivalent, but the two meta positions (if any) might not. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. 

Wait, the aromatic ring is 6-membered, so with two substituents. The substituents could be in positions that create two different types of aromatic H. For example, if the substituents are meta to each other, which would lead to each substituent affecting the adjacent H in a way that creates two different sets. But wait, in di-substituted benzene, the possible substitution patterns are ortho, meta, para. 

Wait, let me think: if substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent H. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the H at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So that would give two aromatic signals. That matches the NMR description.

The next part is two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in an ester group or an alkene. The description says one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, an ester group has an adjacent CH2 group? Or perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group. Let me think. The ester is O-C-O linked to an R group. If the R group has a vinyl group, like maybe an ester attached to a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached, like O-C-O connected to a CH2CH2COOR or something. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group, such as an allyl ester. For example, an ester where the R group is an allyl group, which has CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-O
