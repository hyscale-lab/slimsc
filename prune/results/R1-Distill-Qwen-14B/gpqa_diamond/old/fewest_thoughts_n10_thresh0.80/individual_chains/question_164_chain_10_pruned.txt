Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my binary star dynamics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are given. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. Oh wait, the period is the time between consecutive primary eclipses. So that's the orbital period of the binary system, right?

Then there's some spectroscopic data about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's stars have 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And I need to consider the mass as the sum of the two stars.

Wait, how does radial velocity relate to mass in binary systems? Oh right, in a binary system, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The radial velocity variations are due to the Doppler effect as they move towards and away from us. The amplitude of these velocities is related to the mass ratio.

So, the more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less. The less massive star has a larger velocity. Because in the center of mass, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities.

So, the mass ratio q is m2/m1, where m1 is the more massive star. And the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses. So, v1 (velocity of star 1) = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * V, where V is the total velocity.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio of the velocity amplitudes (v1/v2) should equal (m2/m1). Because the more massive star has smaller velocity. So if star 1 has velocity v1 and star 2 has v2, then v1/v2 = m2/m1.

But wait, in the problem, the amplitude of star 1 in system_1 is 10 km/s, and star 2 is 5 km/s. So the ratio v1/v2 is 10/5 = 2. So that should equal m2/m1. So m2/m1 =
