Okay, so I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product 3 after a series of reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the reactions. Starting with toluene. Toluene treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration usually happens with a nitrating mixture. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, which is activating. So the nitration would add a nitro group. But where? Toluene is meta-directing because the methyl is an activating group, but wait, in nitration, since it's a strong nitrating acid, the nitration typically occurs in the para position, but sometimes meta as well. Wait, no, the methyl is ortho/para directing. So the first product, product 1, would be para-nitrotoluene, right? So structure would be benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group in para positions.

Next step, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I'm thinking about what kind of reaction occurs here. Oh, maybe oxidation of the methyl group. Since nitrotoluene's methyl is in the para position, oxidation would convert the methyl (-CH3) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). So product 2 would be para-methylbenzoic acid? Wait, no. Wait, the methyl is already on the benzene ring, so oxidation should convert it to a COOH group. So then product 2 would be benzoic acid with a nitro group in the para position relative to the COOH. So structure is nitrobenzoic acid, para-nitrobenzoic acid. So the ring has a COOH group and a NO2 group in para positions.

Then, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. I'm trying to remember what reaction conditions are these. Acetone and NaOH... Oh! That sounds like a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. Wait, but product 2 is a nitrobenzoic acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Alternatively, considering that benzoic acid derivatives might undergo
