Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential because it's quadratic in r. The force here follows Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -kr, and in this case, k is m ω², I think. So this is similar to a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, what's the third excited state? Let me think. In quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy level, which is the first state (n=0 maybe?), then the first excited is n=1, second excited n=2, third excited n=3. So we're looking at the state where the principal quantum number is 3? Or is it different in 3D?

Wait, in 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each dimension. Since it's isotropic, the energy depends only on the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. But for a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy is often written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers in x, y, z directions. Or wait, no, maybe I should think of it as three separate 1D oscillators.

Wait, the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Here, n_x, n_y, and n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the energy depends on the sum N = n_x + n_y + n_z. For each N, there are multiple states with different (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations but the same sum.

The energy levels are E_N = (N + 3/2) ħω.
