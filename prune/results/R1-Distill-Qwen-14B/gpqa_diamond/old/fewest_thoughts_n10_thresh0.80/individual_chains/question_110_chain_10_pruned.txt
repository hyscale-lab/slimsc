Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy question, and I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key here is understanding the brightness limits of each instrument.

From what I remember, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means it can detect stars that are up to 17 mag or brighter. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. Oh, I think that's a typo in my mind. Because typically, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that would include stars with magnitude 17 or lower (since magnitude 3 is brighter than magnitude 17). So the limit is apparent magnitude V less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO.

Wait, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So that means apparent magnitude ≤17, since brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16, so apparent mag ≤16. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16 to be visible by HIRES. Because brighter is lower magnitude.

So any star that is detectable by both must have apparent V mag ≤16, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16.

So let's go through each star and compute their apparent V magnitude.

Wait, but some stars have absolute magnitudes, others have apparent. So for each star, I need to calculate apparent V magnitude.

Let me list the stars:

Star1: Absolute V = 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, so log(1) is 0. So m = 15.5 +0 =15.5 mag.

Star2: apparent V is 16.5 mag. So no calculation needed.

Star3: apparent V mag is given as
