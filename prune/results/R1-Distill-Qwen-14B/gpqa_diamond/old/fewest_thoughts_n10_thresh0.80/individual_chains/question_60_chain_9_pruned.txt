Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, there's this alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their spacecraft can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long it takes for them to reach Earth from their own perspective. The options are whether they die before getting there, or specific numbers like 72, 81, 77 years.

Wait, this seems like a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is less than the time experienced by someone stationary relative to the destination (coordinate time). So the key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

But first, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I'm not exactly sure about the exact distance, but I remember that the LMC is pretty far. Wait, let me think. The LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. Hmm, but that's a rough estimate. Let's say approximately 170,000 light-years for calculation purposes.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 c. That's extremely close to the speed of light. So the time from Earth's frame would be the distance divided by speed, but from the astronaut's frame, it's less because of time dilation. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Wait, the astronaut is moving relative to Earth, so the time they experience is the proper time, which is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame. So let's get into the math.

First, the distance to Earth is D ≈ 170,000 light-years. But wait, the speed is 0.99999987 c. So from Earth's perspective, the time taken would be D/(v) = 170,000 ly / 0.99999987 ≈ Let me compute that. Let's approximate 0.99999987 as approximately 1 for ease, but that would be a huge mistake because the speed is so close to c. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 170,000 divided by 0.99999987. Let me think: 170,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 170,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) because 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x. So, x is 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So, 170,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 170,000 + 170,000 * 0.00000013. 170,000 * 0.00000013 is 0.0221. So the time from Earth's frame is roughly 170,000.0221 years. But that's a very small addition, so about 170,000 years.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because if the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, the time from Earth's frame would be D/(v) = (170,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) = (170,000 / 0.99999987) years. Let me calculate that more accurately.

Calculating 170,000 / 0.99999987:

0.99999987 is very close to 1, so the division is just a bit larger than 170,000. Let me compute 170,000 ÷ 0.99999987.

Alternatively, let me compute it as 170,000 * (1/0.99999987). Since 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1 + 0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 + ... but for small x, 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x. So x is 0.00000013.

So 170,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) = 170,000 + 170,000 * 0.00000013.

170,000 * 0.00000013 = 0.0221. So approximately 170,000.0221 years. So about 170,000 years as seen from Earth.

But the astronaut is moving at that speed, so the time experienced is less. How much less?

In special relativity, the proper time (τ) experienced by the astronaut is given by:

τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

where t is the time in Earth's frame, v is the speed, and c is the speed of light.

So τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

v = 0.99999987 c.

So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5? Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-7 is 1e-7, so sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 = approx 3.16e-4.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = (0.9999997400000001) c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9999997400000001 = 0.0000002599999999.

Wait, is that right? Let's compute 0.99999987 squared.

Wait, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So a is 1, b is 0.00000013.

So (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + negligible. So approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 -
