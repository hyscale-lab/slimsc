Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the particles involved here are nuclei. The problem states that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3. Wait, but if it has 3 neutrons, what's the mass number? Oh, right, lithium typically has an isotope. Let me think: Li usually has 3 protons and if 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh, right, the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus. So the particle is a Li-6 ion. So its atomic number is 3, and mass number is 6. So the charge is +3e, but wait, for the purpose of calculating energy, maybe I just need the mass.

Now, the speed is given as 0.96c. So I need to calculate the total energy of this ion when moving at that speed. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, the problem is asking for the energy of the collider. So I think it's the kinetic energy, but sometimes colliders refer to the total energy. Hmm, I need to double-check the question. The question says, "what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So I think it's the kinetic energy because the problem is about the energy imparted to the nucleus to reach that speed. Or wait, sometimes colliders' energy refers to the total energy. I'm a bit unsure here. Let me think.

In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the total energy, which includes the rest mass
