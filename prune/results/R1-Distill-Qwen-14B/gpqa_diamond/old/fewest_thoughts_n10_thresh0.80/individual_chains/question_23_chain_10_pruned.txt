Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures.

Hmm, I think I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction. But wait, the molecule here has an ether linkage. Oh right, the structure is an aryl ether with a substituted butenyl group. So the structure is benzene with an oxy group attached to a butenyl chain. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, which would look like CH2CH(C(CH3)2)CH2O- attached to benzene? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene? Wait, but wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So 3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 2? Wait, but the numbering is but-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw it.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, because but is four carbons. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4. But that's impossible for butene because the longest chain can only be four carbons, so the double bond can't be at position 3. So wait, perhaps but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-O-? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is:

CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene? But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at carbon 3. So maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right because butene is four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH
