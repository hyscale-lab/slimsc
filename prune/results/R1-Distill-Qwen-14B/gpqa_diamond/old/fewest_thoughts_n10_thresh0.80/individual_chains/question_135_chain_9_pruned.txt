Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll think it out.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I should parse this. So, the term involves the field X interacting with some fermion ψ. The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV, and we're to find its kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, so boson decay typically happens when the boson can split into particles whose combined mass is less than the boson's mass. Since X is a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? So, I need to find all possible fermion pairs that the X boson can decay into, considering their masses.

But wait, the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, each fermion in the pair must have mass less than half of 6 GeV, because each fermion gets some energy, but for the minimum case, when they are produced at rest, each would have mass less than 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV is the total, so each would get 3 GeV if the decay is at rest. But wait, actually, when a particle decays, the rest mass of each product must be less than the parent's mass. Wait no, the parent's mass must be larger than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Because energy and momentum have to be conserved. So for X to decay into a pair of particles, each must have a rest mass less than M_X / 2.

So let me list all the known fermion masses. Let's see:

Up quark (u): around 2 MeV
Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
Strange (s): ~95-100 MeV
Charm (c): ~1.3 GeV
Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
Top (t): way heavier, ~173 GeV
Electron (e): ~0
