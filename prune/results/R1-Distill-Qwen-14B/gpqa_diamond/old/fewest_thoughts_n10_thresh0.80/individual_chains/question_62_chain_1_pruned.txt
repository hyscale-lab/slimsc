Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me take it step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. It looks like there's a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a carbaldehyde group (CHO). Then, there's another substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent has a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH2OH (since hydroxy is OH, and methyl would be CH3, but wait, no, wait—it's cyclohexyl attached to CH2-OH, right? Wait, no, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, so that's CH2OH attached to the cyclohexane. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the main cyclohexane.

Wait, the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so that's a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group. Then, on the same carbon where the CHO is attached, there's a substituent which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group. So, the structure is:

At the 1-position of cyclohexane, there's a CHO group, and also a CH2OH which is connected to another cyclohexane ring. So, the carbon at position 1 has two substituents: CHO and CH2-OH (but that CH2-OH is also connected to a cyclohexyl group, making it cyclohexylmethyl-OH? Wait, maybe it's CH2 connected to both the cyclohexane and the cyclohexyl group. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should focus on the reaction steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH2 group, making it cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

The goal is to get from eth
