Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and then go through each part to figure out what's going on.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is close to 277 K. There's also a mention of a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially when considering its analog.

Hmm, okay, let me try to identify each part. I think I should start by figuring out what each substance could be. Let's list what I know.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. Also, when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K. I remember that water freezes at 273 K (which is about 0째C), so 277 K is just a bit higher, around 4째C. Wait, but melting point is when a solid turns into liquid. So if B's melting point is 277 K, then B is probably a solid at room temperature and melts just above 0째C. Hmm, I'm trying to think of a substance like that. Maybe... something like sodium hydroxide? No, wait, sodium hydroxide's melting point is higher. Or maybe something like paraffin wax? No, that's way higher. Wait, another thought: what about ice? No, because ice melts at 273 K. But 277 K is 4째C, so maybe something else.

Wait, maybe G is a carbonate? Because when carbonates are heated, they can decompose. Like, if G is a carbonate, heating might produce CO2 and the metal oxide. For example, CaCO3 when heated gives CaO and CO2. But then, what's B in that case? It would be CaO, which has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide. Wait, but heating hydroxides might not release a gas. Or perhaps G is a sulfide, but that's more for reactions with acids.

Wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons
