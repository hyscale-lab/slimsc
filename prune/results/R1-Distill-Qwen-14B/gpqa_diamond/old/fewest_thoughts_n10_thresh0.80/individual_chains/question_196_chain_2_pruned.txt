Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a particle in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c, and I need to find which of the given options is correct for the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which would be option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. This problem is relativistic, so I can't use that.

Right, in relativity, the equations change. The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is constant. At maximum displacement, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the speed is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic.

So, the potential energy at maximum amplitude A is (1/2)kA², right? So the total energy E is that.

At maximum speed, x=0, so kinetic energy is E. So,

E = (gamma - 1) mc².

But E is also (1/2)kA². So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator might still be (1/2)kx², but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe that's a given since the question states it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential is (1/2)kx², so that part remains same. So E is (1/2)kA².

Thus,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Let me express gamma in terms of v. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So,

(1/2)kA² = (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) - 1 ) * mc².

Hmm, I need to solve for v_max. Let me denote (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Let me rearrange this equation.

gamma = ( (1/2)kA² )/(mc²) ) + 1.

Wait, no. Let me do this correctly. Let me write:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2)kA² )/( mc² ) ).

Hmm, but wait, when kA² is much smaller than 2mc², this would reduce to the classical case. Because then gamma ≈ 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²), and then v_max would be sqrt( (kA²)/(m) ), which matches option C. But when kA² is comparable to mc², then relativistic effects are significant.

So, the next step is to express gamma in terms of v, and then find v.

Let me write gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (1/(2 mc²)) kA².

Wait, wait, that's

gamma = 1 + ( (k A^2) )/( 2 m c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me take the reciprocal of both sides.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Simplify the denominator: Let me write it as 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (2 m c²)/(2 m c² + k A²).

Then, square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's denote B = k A²/(2 m c²). So,

gamma = 1 + B.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + B.

Rearranging,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + B) = 1 - [ B/(1+B) ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to take reciprocal again:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + B).

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2 ).

But B is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( 1 + (k A²)/(2
