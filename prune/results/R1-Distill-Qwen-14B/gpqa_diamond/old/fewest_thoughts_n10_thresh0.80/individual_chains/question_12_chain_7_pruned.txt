Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that a Pi-plus pion, which is at rest, decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV, and I guess the neutrino's mass is negligible, right? Because neutrinos are super light, almost massless compared to other particles.

Wait, but neutrinos do have some mass, but I think in these kinds of problems, we often treat them as massless to simplify things. So I'll proceed under that assumption unless the problem states otherwise. So the neutrino is treated as having zero rest mass here.

The question is about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles. So the pion is initially at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

When it decays, the total energy has to be conserved. So the sum of the energies of the mu and the neutrino should equal the energy of the pion before decay. Also, momentum should be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the mu and the neutrino after decay must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to sum to zero.

Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum here. Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu. Similarly, their momenta would be p_mu and p_nu.

So, from conservation of energy:
E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

From conservation of momentum:
p_mu = -p_nu, so the magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just E_nu = p c. Wait, because for massless particles, E = pc. So E_nu = p c.

For the muon, which has mass m_mu, the energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units might be a bit confusing. Let me think about natural units where c=1. Then for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). Since in MeV units, m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², but when c=1, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 )

And E_nu = p.

Putting into the energy equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Let me call 105.7 as m for simplicity. So:

sqrt(p² + m²) + p = M, where M is 139.6.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + m²) = M - p.

Now square both sides:

p² + m² = (M - p)²
p² + m² = M² - 2 M p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:

m² = M² - 2 M p

Rearranged:

2 M p = M² - m²

So p = (M² - m²) / (2 M)

Let me compute that.

M is 139.6, m is 105.7.

Compute M²: 139.6² = let's see, 140 squared is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So:

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, m² is 105.7^2. Let's calculate that.

105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross term is 2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147.

So (105.7)^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then, 2 M is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Well, 279.2 * 29.8 is approximately 279 * 30 = 8370, but 29.8 is 0.2 less than 30, so 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 *30 - 279.2 *0.2 = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, so 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So the actual p is a bit less than 29.8.

Let me compute 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is 8320.16 -8315.67 = 4.49 higher. So to get 4.49 less in the product, since each 1 unit of p gives 279.2, so 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016. So p ≈29.8 -0.016=29.784 MeV/c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just approximate p as about 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

The exact calculation would be:

8315.67 / 279.2

I can compute this by long division.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Let me approximate.

279.2 × 29.78 = ?

Wait, 279.2 × 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2=8096.8. Then, 0.78 times 279.2 is about 0.78*280=218.4, but we have 279.2, so 0.78*279.2= approx 217.536.

So 29.78 ×279.2 ≈ 8096.8 + 0.78×279.2 ≈ 8096.8 + 217.536= 8314.336.

Which is close to 8315.67. So the difference is 8315.67 -8314.336=1.334.

So how much more do I need? Each additional 0.001 in p adds 279.2 *0.001 =0.2792.

So 1.334 /279.2 ≈ 0.00478.

So p≈29.78 +0.00478≈29.7848 MeV/c.

So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

What about E_mu? E_mu = M - E_nu =139.6 -29.78=109.82 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. So its kinetic energy would be E_mu - m_mu c², but if E_mu is 109.82 MeV and m_mu is 105.7, then KE_mu=109.82 -105.7=4.12 MeV.

And the neutrino's KE is E_nu, since its rest mass is zero. So neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV. Wait, but the options given are in pairs, like 2.84 and 26.8, etc.

Wait, the options don't list 29.8 and 4.12. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV

C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV

D)4.1
