Okay, so I have this science problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius, so it's a solid at room temperature. 

Another part says that when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. My task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. I remember that in organic chemistry, some common reagents include things like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7, which are strong oxidizing agents. But wait, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is something like H2O, but with a heavier isotope, like deuterium? Or perhaps it's something else.

Let me break down the reactions:

1. X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons. That must mean it's a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Common gases: maybe H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H (protons 1 each, neutrons 0 each) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons?), wait, no, wait O has atomic number 8, so normally 8 protons and 8 neutrons for O-16. So H2O has 2 H (each with 1 p, 0 n) and O with 8 p and 8 n. So total: 2 protons and 8 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another possibility: Maybe W is CO2? But CO2 has C (6 p, 6 neutrons in C-12), O (8p, 8n). So molecule has 6+8 =14 protons, and 6+8=14 neutrons. So 14 and 14. Oh, that fits. So W is CO2? Or maybe another molecule.

Wait, another possibility: H2. H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. Or O2? O2 is O-O, which is 8 protons each, sum 16. Neutrons: each O has 8, so 16 total. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That works. So W could be O2. Or maybe NH3? Wait, NH3 has 14 protons (N:7, H:1 each Ã—3) and 14 neutrons (N:7-7=0? Wait no, N is usually N-14, which has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. Wait, each H has 0 neutrons, so NH3 has 14 protons and 7 neutrons. So 14 and 7, not equal. So no.

Alternatively, maybe W is CO
