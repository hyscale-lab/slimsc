Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, there's some induced charge, right?

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charge on it would stay because the grounding allows the excess charge to flow away. But wait, no, when the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can leave, but if the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges would be on the surface. Oh, right, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface.

So when I place a charge q outside the sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero because it's in contact with the ground (which is at zero potential). So the sphere's potential is zero, and the charge q will induce some charges on the sphere.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the sphere is grounded, the potential of the sphere is the same as the ground, which is zero. So the potential at any point on the sphere is zero. The charge q is placed outside the sphere, so the induced charges on the sphere will adjust so that the potential on the sphere remains zero.

But how does this affect the potential energy of the system? Oh, right, the potential energy U between two charges is given by U = k q1 q2 / r, but in this case, the induced charges on
