Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

An equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they only form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes. The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which I think is a drying agent. The second tube has Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper.

The results are that the first and third tubes gained weight. Specifically, tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g. The second tube's weight didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what each of these tubes does. 

Tube 1 has Mg(ClO4)2, which is magnesium perchlorate. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used as a desiccant because it's highly deliquescent. So when gases pass through it, if there's any water vapor, it would be absorbed. But wait, the problem says the tube gained 3.60g. So maybe the gas is reacting with Mg(ClO4)2? Or perhaps it's absorbing water, but since Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, maybe it's reacting with something else.

Wait, another thought. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent and can also react with certain gases. For example, it can react with water vapor to form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas in the tube is something like water vapor, but since it's anhydrous, maybe it's absorbing HCl or another acid.

Wait, but the first tube's weight increased. So the gas entering must have reacted and added mass. Maybe the gas has water, which adds to the tube. For example, if the gas is water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, converting into the hydrate, thus increasing the mass.

But wait, the initial heating was done without air, so maybe the salts decompose into gases. Let's think about what could be released when salts are heated.

Salts when heated can decompose into various products. For example, nitrates can produce NO2 or O2 and other gases. Maybe sulfates decompose into SO3 and such. Alternatively, carbonates might decompose into CO2 and the corresponding metal oxide.

Wait, but the first tube gained 3.60g. Let me think about possible gases that could be absorbed here. Maybe H2O? Or perhaps SO3? Or maybe CO2?

Alternatively, looking at the second tube, which has Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the second tube's weight didn't change. Oh, so the gas didn't react with the solution, meaning the gas wasn't CO2. Because if it were, Ca(OH)2 would absorb it and the weight would increase.

Wait, but the second tube's weight didn't change. So the gas that passed through must not have reacted with Ca(OH)2. So the gas isn't acidic, like CO2 or SO3. Or perhaps it's an inert gas, like maybe nitrogen or something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a hydrocarbon or something else that doesn't react with the solution.

Moving on to the third tube: red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So the gas must have reacted with copper to form CuO. What gases react with copper upon heating?

Well, maybe H2S. If H2S passes over hot copper, it can cause the copper to react. For example: Cu + H2S → CuS + H2. But wait, that would produce CuS, but in the presence of oxygen, maybe it oxidizes to CuO. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO2. When SO2 reacts with copper, maybe it forms CuSO4? Wait, but the product is CuO. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when CO reacts with copper oxide, it can reduce it, but that requires high temperatures. But in this case, the copper is red-hot. Wait, if the gas is H2O vapor, perhaps it reacts with the copper to form CuO and H2? Let me think: 2 H2O + 4 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 H2O → no, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the reaction would be 2 H2O + 4 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 H2. But under what conditions does that happen? Maybe high temperature.

Wait, but the gas after tube 3 is 2.24 liters of gas C. At STP, 22.4 L is 1 mole, so 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is something that's left after all the reactions.

Putting it all together: the initial mixture of salts A and B, when heated, decomposes into gases. These gases go through the three tubes, and the only gas left is gas C.

Let me try to outline the possible reactions.

1. Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2. The gas entering (from the decomposition) causes the tube to gain 3.60g. So perhaps the gas is H2O. Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O would form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, which would increase the mass by the mass of H2O added. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.

2. Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. The gas doesn't react, so the gas isn't acidic. So, maybe the gas is N2, CO, H2, or another neutral gas.

3. Tube 3: Red-hot copper. The gas reacts to form CuO, gaining 0.80g. The reaction could be something like 2 H2O + 4 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 H2. Let's see, the mass gain would be the mass of CuO formed minus the mass of the gas that reacted.

Wait, the mass gain in tube 3 is 0.80g. Let's compute the possible reaction.

Suppose the gas is H2O. Let's see:

If the reaction is 2 H2O + 4 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 H2.

Molar masses: Cu is 63.55 g/mol, CuO is 80 g/mol, H2O is 18 g/mol, H2 is 2 g/mol.

The change in mass is (2 *80) - (2*18) = 160 - 36 = 124 g per 4 moles of Cu and 2 moles H2O. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's H2O reacting with copper oxide? No, the copper is in the form of metal. So, perhaps the reaction is:

H2O + Cu → CuO + H2. Let's balance it:

H2O + Cu → CuO + ½ H2.

Wait, but that's not balanced. Let me write the balanced equation.

Cu + H2O → CuO + H2.

Balancing:

Cu: 1 each side.

H: 2 on left, 2 on right (from H2O and H2).

O: 1 on each side.

So the equation is:

Cu + H2O → CuO + H2.

The molar masses: 64 + 18 = 80 + 2.

So per mole, mass change is 80 + 2 (product) vs 64 +18 (reactant) → wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's compute the mass difference.

Each mole of reaction: 1 mole Cu (64g) + 1 mole H2O (18g) → 1 mole CuO (80g) + 1 mole H2 (2g).

Total mass on left: 64 +18=82g.

Total mass on right: 80 +2=82g. So no mass change. That can't be right because the tube's mass increased by 0.80g. Hmm, maybe another reaction.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the mass gained in tube 3. The mass increased by 0.80g. So the reaction must have added 0.80g of CuO.

The mass of CuO formed is 0.80g. The formula weight of CuO is 64 +16 =80 g/mol. So moles of CuO formed is 0.80 /80 =0.01 mol.

So, 0.01 moles of CuO. Let's see what reaction would produce this.

Suppose the gas is H2S. H2S + Cu → CuS + H2. But that would produce CuS, not CuO. Alternatively, if H2S reacts with CuO, but that's not the case here because the copper is in the form of metal.

Wait, perhaps the gas is SO2. SO2 + Cu → CuSO4? But that reaction requires specific conditions. Alternatively, SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuS + O2? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the gas is CO. CO + Cu → Doesn't react unless in presence of O2, perhaps. But maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is a mixture, but let's think about the third tube. The reaction forms CuO, so the gas must have oxygen. Or perhaps the gas is steam (H2O), but then the reaction would produce H2 and CuO.

Wait, let's stick with the H2O
