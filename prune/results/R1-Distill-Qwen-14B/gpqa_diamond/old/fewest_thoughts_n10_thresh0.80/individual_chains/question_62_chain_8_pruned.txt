Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break down its structure. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached. Then, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, so that substituent is like a CH2-OH connected to a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure would have a cyclohexane ring, with a -CH2-C(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached, and also a -CHO group.

Wait, no, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO at position 1. Then, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) attached to this same position. So, the position 1 has two substituents: a formyl group and a CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a carbon can't have two substituents at the same position unless it's a substituent on a branch. Maybe it's more like the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and also the formyl group is attached to the same carbon?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with a -CHO group. The substituent is at position 1, which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, that substituent is a CH2
