Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think that's a 3-component vector because the matrices provided are 3x3. So the state is a superposition of three basis states, right?

The problem introduces two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given as matrices. I need to find the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q.

Wait, no, wait. The question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Oh wait, no, no, wait—the order is that P is measured first, then Q. Because it says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P"—so the sequence is measure P first, then Q. But the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the joint probability of first getting 0 in P and then -1 in Q.

Wait, no. Actually, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the first measurement of P would take the system into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q would be done on this new state, which is the eigenstate of P. So the probability of getting -1 for Q is the probability that this eigenstate of P is also an eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue -1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probabilities step by step.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q. Because when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenvector of that operator, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector in the state.

Wait, but let's get started step by step.

First, the initial state is a vector: let me denote it as |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, but quantum states are usually normalized, so the sum of the squares of the components should be 1. Let's check that. (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =
