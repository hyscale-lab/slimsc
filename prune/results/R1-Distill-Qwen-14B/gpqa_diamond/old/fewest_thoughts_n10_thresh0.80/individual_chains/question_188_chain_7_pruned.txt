Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but wait, is that the lattice parameter a? Or is that something else? Oh wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so all edges are of length a, which I think is the interatomic distance here. So a = 10 Angstrom.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... something involving the angles. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles between the edges is a bit more complicated than the simple cubic case.

In the simple cubic case, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of a hexagonal or orthorhombic system, I think the formula involves the cosines of the angles. Wait, more accurately, I think the formula comes from the Miller indices and the structure of the crystal. The general formula for interplanar distance in
