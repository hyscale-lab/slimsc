Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are easier to handle. The problem gives me a specific state, and I need to compute the relative entropy-based non-Gaussianity measure.

Let me start by understanding the given state. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states: cos(phi)|alpha> and sin(phi)|-alpha>, all divided by a normalization constant N. Oh wait, N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). That makes sense because when you have a superposition of coherent states, the normalization involves the overlap between them, which depends on the phase phi and the amplitude alpha.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So I should plug these into the expression for N. Let me compute sin(2*phi) first. Since phi is -pi/4, 2*phi is -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2*phi) = -1. Then, exp(-2*alpha^2) becomes exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So the denominator inside the square root is 1 + (-1)*0.6065. That would be 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

Wait, but wait. N is the normalization constant, so when we construct the density matrix rho from |psi>, it's |psi><psi| divided by N squared perhaps? Or wait, |psi> is (cos(phi)|a> + sin(phi)|-a>)/N. So the density matrix rho is (|psi><psi|), which would be [cos^2(phi)|a><a| + sin^2(phi)|-a><-a| + cos(phi) sin(phi)(|a><-a| + |-a><a|)] / N^2. But wait, actually, no—because when you have a state |psi> = (a|alpha> + b|beta>)/N, the density matrix is |psi><psi|, so it's (a a* |alpha><alpha| + a b* |alpha><beta| + b a* |beta><alpha| + b b* |beta><beta| ) / N^2.

But Gaussian states are superpositions of coherent states with the same amplitude but opposite phases, perhaps? Or wait, coherent states are Gaussian themselves. So a superposition of two coherent states can be non-Gaussian if the state isn't a displaced thermal state or something like that.

The non-Gaussianity is being measured by the relative entropy between rho and tau, where tau is a Gaussian state. The relative entropy is given by del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Wait, but isn't that the definition of the relative entropy of entanglement or something else?
