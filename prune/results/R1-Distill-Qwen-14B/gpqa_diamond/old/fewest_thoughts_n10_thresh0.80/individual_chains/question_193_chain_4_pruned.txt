Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, it's like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. Wait, no, wait. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So d = 1/plx.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, I think I need to express N in terms of distance and then see how N changes as r (distance) changes.

Let me write down what I know. N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, that means 1/plx is d. So plx = 1/d → plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. Then 1/(plx)^5 = d^5.

So, N ∝ d^5. Wait, but wait. Because N is the number of stars, and we're looking at how N changes with distance, but in terms of per unit range of distance. So I think the question is asking about the differential, like dN/dr, right? Because it's the change in number per unit distance.

So, if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant.

But since plx is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d), substituting that in, N = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So when you move a small distance dr, how does N change? That's the derivative, right? So dN = 5k d^4 dr. Which implies that dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the
