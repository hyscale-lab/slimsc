Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, what's that? Well, C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but propene is more common for reactions. So I think Compound A is propene, which is CH₂=CH₂CH₃ or maybe another isomer, but propene is the main one.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, I remember that bromination with CCl4 is usually an addition reaction for alkenes. So if A is propene, adding Br2 in CCl4 would lead to 1,2-dibromopropane. Let me write that down: Compound B would be BrCH₂CHBrCH3? Wait, no. Propene is CH₂=CHCH3. When Br2 adds across the double bond, it would form 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait. Wait, no. Adding Br2 to propene (CH₂=CH₂CH3) would add across the double bond. So propene has CH₂-CH₂-CH3. Adding Br would give CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait. Let me think again. Propene is CH₂=CHCH3. When Br2 adds across the double bond, it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So it's 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So in such conditions, an elimination reaction occurs—probably dehydrohalogenation. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with alcoholic KOH would lead to the elimination of HBr twice. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think. When you have vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Br atoms) and treat them with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, you typically get an elimination reaction. The first step might remove one Br, but then what's next? Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination.

Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane reacting
