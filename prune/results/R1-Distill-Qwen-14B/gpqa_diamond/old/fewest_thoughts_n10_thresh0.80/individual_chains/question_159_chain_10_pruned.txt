Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a quasar's comoving distance in the universe as described by the Lambda-CDM model. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes there's a prominent peak around that wavelength. But how does that relate to the comoving distance?

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance when the scale factor a is 1, which is the current universe. So I need to figure out the distance to this quasar based on the given parameters.

The given cosmological parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm = 0.3, dark energy Ωλ = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωm + Ωλ = 1, which it does here).

I think the comoving distance (often denoted as D_C) depends on the integral of 1/(a H) da from a=0 to a=1. But wait, for the comoving distance to a source at redshift z, it's computed using the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the formula for comoving distance is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫[0 to z] [1 / E(z')] dz', where E(z') = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωk*(1+z')^2 + Ωλ). Since the universe is flat, Ωk=0, so E(z) simplifies to sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ).

So the first thing I need is the redshift z of the quasar. But how do I get z from the observed data?

The peak at 790 nm suggests that the quasar is emitting in the near-infrared and optical. Wait, but if we're looking at the rest-frame emission, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted because of redshift. Oh wait, no—wait, the quasar's emission is at a certain rest wavelength. The observed wavelength is longer if the quasar
