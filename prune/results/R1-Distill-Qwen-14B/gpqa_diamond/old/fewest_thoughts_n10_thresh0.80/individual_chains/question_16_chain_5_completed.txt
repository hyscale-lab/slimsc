Okay, I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity usually relates to whether a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. Let me go through each compound one by one. 

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. The substituents on each carbon are Cl and CH2CH3 on C1, and a CH3 group on C2. But wait, the configuration is Z. For a compound to be chiral, it needs a chiral center. A double bond can have E/Z isomerism, but does that make the molecule chiral? I think for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a tetrahedral center where four different groups are attached. So, let's look at C1. It has Cl, CH2CH3, a double bond to C2, and a single bond to another carbon (probably CH2 something). Wait, wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-C double bond CH-CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, the substituents on each carbon in the double bond. C1 has Cl and CH2CH2CH3 (if but-1-ene is four carbons). Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C1 has Cl, two H's? No, wait, the formula would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl. So C1 would be CHCl, CH2Cl? Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. For a double bond, even if it's in a Z configuration, unless there's a chiral center, the molecule isn't chiral. So in this case, I don't think the Z configuration creates chirality. So first compound: no optical activity.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Okay, that's a mouthful. Methanoisobenzofuran suggests a fused ring system, perhaps. The substituents are chloromethylene (Cl-C=C-) attached at position 8. The molecule has E configuration. Wait, but does that create a chiral center? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it wouldn't be chiral. But with the substituents and the ring, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center because of the R and S designations. Wait, 3aR and 7aS. So those are stereocenters. So if the molecule has stereocenters, it's chiral. So this compound would be optically active. So yes, it has optical activity.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If there are substituents at C2 and C3, like methyl groups, then each of those carbons would have four different groups. For C2: two methyl groups? No, wait, no. Wait, wait: 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would have methyl groups on C2 and C3 of succinic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2(CH3)-CH2(CH3)-COOH? No, wait, no, wait, succinic acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)H-COOH? Wait, but each of those would have two methyl groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait: 2 and 3 positions. Let me think: the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, because in succinic acid, the two central carbons are CH2. So adding a methyl to each: so each becomes CH(CH3). So each of the central CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of those carbons (C2 and C3) would have two methyl groups? Wait, no, maybe. So each would have: attached to C2: a methyl, a CH2COOH group, and two other substituents. Let me count. C2: one methyl, two from the adjacent CH(CH3), and the other is the other CH2. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about each carbon. C2 would have:
- one methyl (from 2R)
- a CH2 group on one side (connected to C1, which is COOH)
- another CH2 group on the other side (connected to C3)
Wait, no, because with the methyl at C2, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, each CH(CH3) would be C2 and C3. So each of those carbons would have the groups: CH3, two CH2 groups? No, wait, no. Let me consider the groups attached to C2. C2 is connected to:
- COOH (from C1)
- two CH(CH3) groups on either side?
Wait, no, perhaps I'm not getting the structure right. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would add a methyl to each of the CH2 groups, making them CH(CH3) groups. So C2: CH(CH3), which is connected to C1 (COOH), and C3 (CH(CH3)), which is connected to C4 (COOH). So each of C2 and C3 would have the groups: COOH (from C1), COOH (from C4?), no, wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (which is CH2COOH), no. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Actually, each of C2 and C3 would have a methyl group, and their other groups would be the adjacent carbons. So for C2: groups would be methyl, two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), and the COOH group? Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe each has a methyl, two CH2 groups (but wait, C2 is connected to C1, which is a CH2 from the COOH, and C3, which is a CH(CH3). Hmm, perhaps each of these carbons has four different groups. Let's see: for C2, groups are methyl, two CHs (from C1 and C3), and the COOH side? I'm not sure, but the question says (2R,3S), which implies that both are chiral centers. So if both are stereocenters, then the molecule is chiral. So yes, this compound has optical activity.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So same structure as the third but with both R configurations. Wait, but this is a meso compound? Because if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. Let me think: if the two stereocenters are R and R, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be achiral. So for example, in tartaric acid, the meso form is when both stereocenters are R and S (or opposite), leading to a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. In meso compounds, the stereocenters are mirror images, making the molecule achiral. So in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if both are R, then maybe it's a meso form. Wait, no, because if the substituents are arranged such that it's symmetric. Wait, for instance, if you have two identical groups on either side, but the configurations are R and R. No, if the configurations are both R, then perhaps the molecule isn't symmetric. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the molecule. If the two stereocenters are both R, that could make the molecule chiral or meso, depending on symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two stereocenters mirror images, then it's meso. So for example, if the two substituents on each chiral center are arranged symmetrically, then it's meso. So in this case, with both R configurations, would that lead to a plane of symmetry?

Wait, the structure is (2R,3R). So for C2 and C3, each has a methyl group. So the groups attached to C2 would be: methyl, two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), and a COOH group. Wait, no, perhaps the groups are methyl, two CH(CH3) groups (since the adjacent carbons are also substituted), and maybe another group. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps if the molecule is symmetric, the two R configurations may lead to a meso form. So if it's a meso compound, it won't have optical activity because it's achiral. So for (2R,3R), if the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound and optically inactive. So in that case, this compound wouldn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. If the four substituents around each chiral center are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So for 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if both are R and the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it's a meso compound. So in that case, (2R,3R) would be a meso compound, which is achiral. So this compound would not be optically active.

Alternatively, if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it's chiral, but in this case, I think it's symmetric because the two stereocenters are mirror images. So this compound is achiral, so no optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So a cyclohexene ring with an OH group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R. Wait, but cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. The R configuration implies that the OH is in a specific position relative to the other substituents. But wait, is the molecule chiral? For a cyclohexene ring, the ring could have substituents that give rise to chirality.

Wait, the OH is on C1, which is a chiral center if it's attached to four different groups. Let's see: C1 has an OH, a cyclohexene ring (so, two adjacent carbons), and two other substituents. Wait, the ring in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would be a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 3. So C1 is connected to C6 and C2, and the OH. But wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So in C1, substituents are OH, C2, C6, and another group? Wait, no, wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two other groups. If the ring is substituted, then C1 would have substituents like OH and maybe a hydrogen and two other ring carbons. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of the cyclohexane ring: each carbon has two adjacent ring carbons and two other substituents. So C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has an OH group, and the other substituents would be two H's and two ring carbons. So that would be three substituents (OH, two H's, and two ring bonds), but wait, that can't be. Wait, no, each carbon in the cyclohexane ring has two ring bonds and two substituents. So for C1, substituents are OH and another substituent (like H or another group). Wait, in this case, the substituents on C1 are OH, H, and two ring bonds. So the groups attached would be: OH, H, and two ring carbons (C2 and C6). That would be four substituents. So to be a chiral center, all four substituents must be different.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents would be OH, H, C2 (which is a CH2 group?), and C6 (another CH2 group). So C2 and C6 are each connected to C1, and the other substituents are H and OH. So are C2 and C6 each different from each other? Because if the double bond is at position 3, maybe C2 and C6 are different. Because the double bond would affect the structure around the ring. Hmm, perhaps. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Or perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes C1 not a chiral center.

Wait, but the configuration is given as R. That implies that the carbon is a chiral center. So perhaps the molecule is chiral. So this compound would exhibit optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The configuration is s for each. Now, a cyclohexane with three OH groups, all in s configuration. Is this molecule chiral? Well, for a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. So if all three OH groups are in the same configuration (like all s), does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions, that's every other carbon. So the structure would have a trigonal symmetry. So a plane through the center of the ring and perpendicular to the plane of the ring could be a symmetry plane. Thus, the molecule would be achiral, making it a meso compound. Alternatively, perhaps each of the OH groups is on a chiral center, but the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So this compound might not be optically active.

Wait, but let me think about the individual centers. Each OH is on a carbon that's connected to three other carbons (in the ring) and an OH. So each of those would have four substituents. Are any of them the same? For example, if the carbon at position 1 has two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), an OH, and a hydrogen, then it would have four different groups, making it a chiral center. Similarly for C3 and C5. But when all three are s, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have a plane going through the center of the ring and the opposite face, it might make the molecule symmetric. So maybe the molecule is achiral, so no optical activity.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three OH groups create a lack of symmetry. Hmm, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has an even number of chiral centers, but the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound. So for example, tartaric acid with two chiral centers can be a meso compound if the configurations are opposite. In this case, with three chiral centers, it's trickier. But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it could be meso. For instance, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is a mirror image of itself, it would be achiral. So in this case, perhaps this cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is a meso compound, making it achiral. So no optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure-wise, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-C(=O)-CH2-. Wait, but 1-cyclopentyl would be the cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-, but that's not correct. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-, but more accurately, it's:

O
||
CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R, where R is the substituent. So 1-cyclopentyl would be the cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, butan-1-one is acetone? No, acetone is propan-2-one. Butan-1-one would be pentan-2-one? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-1-one would have the structure CH2CH2CH2C(=O) something. Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me get the structure right. The butan-1-one means the carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would be pentan-1-one. Hmm, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons. Oh wait, butane is four carbons. So butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's five. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-R? No, perhaps 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be a four-carbon chain with a carbonyl at position 1. So the structure is:

O
||
C(CH2cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)2)

Wait, no, wait. Butan-1-one would be (CH2)3-C(=O)-R. So 1-cyclopentyl would be the substituent on the carbonyl carbon. Oh wait, no, the carbonyl is on C1, so the substituent is on C1 as well. So the structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)2?)

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, and the rest of the chain is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the molecule as having the structure where the carbonyl is at position 1, so the substituents are cyclopentyl and a propyl chain. Wait, perhaps it's:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, but butan-1-one has four carbons in the chain. So the carbonyl is on C1, so the chain is CH3-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. But regardless, the important thing is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

In 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl carbon is C=O, which is double-bonded and thus not a chiral center. So where are the chiral centers? Let's look at the other carbons. The cyclopentyl group is attached to the carbonyl, but that's a ring and not a chiral center. The other carbons in the chain: examining each, like the one attached to the carbonyl, which is C1. Let's see: C1 is the carbonyl carbon, so no. The next carbon, C2: what's attached? Let's consider the structure:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, but in butan-1-one, the carbonyl is on the first carbon, so the structure is:

O
||
C-R-C-CH2-CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the other carbons. The C2 would be connected to C1 (carbonyl group), a CH2 group, perhaps another CH, and a hydrogen. Wait, but unless there's a chiral center, the molecule isn't chiral.

Wait, perhaps the carbon at position 3 (the CH(CH3)) is a chiral center. Let me see: attached to it would be:

- CH2 from C2
- CH3 (the methyl)
- CH2 from C4
- and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the middle carbons are CH2 and CH(CH3). So the CH(CH3) would have four substituents: two CH2 groups, a CH3, and a hydrogen. So that would make it a chiral center. Because four different groups: CH2-CO, CH2-CH2CH3, CH3, and H. So that would imply a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and hence optically active.

Wait, but wait, the actual structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the chain is butan-1-one, which is four carbons with the carbonyl on the first. The substituents are cyclopentyl on the carbonyl (so C1 is O=C-cyclopentyl), then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH3. So the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH(CH3)
- CH3
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it:

O
|
C(cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - ?

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is four carbons: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But if the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl, it would be:

O=C-(cyclopentyl) - CH2 - C(CH3)H - CH2 - ?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2- ?

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the molecule has a chiral center. So if the CH(CH3) carbon has four different substituents, then it's chiral. So in that case, the molecule would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but in butan-1-one, the carbonyl is on C1, and the substituents are cyclopentyl on C1, CH2 on C2, CH(CH3) on C3, and CH2CH3 on C4. So C3 would have:

- CH2 from C2
- CH(CH3)
- CH2 from C4
- and a hydrogen.

So four different groups: yes. So that would make C3 a chiral center, so the molecule is chiral and optically active.

Now, let me count how many of these compounds are optically active.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers, so no optical activity.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Has stereocenters, so yes.
3. (2R,3S)-...: Both chiral centers, so yes.
4. (2R,3R)-...: If meso, no. Otherwise, yes. I think it's meso, so no.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, it's chiral.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-...: If it's meso, no. I think it's symmetric, so no.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes, chiral center at C3.

So let's tally:

Compound 2: yes (1)
3: yes (2)
5: yes (3)
7: yes (4)
Wait, that's four. Wait, but what about compound 4: I thought it's meso. So 4 would be no. Compound 6: no. So how many are yes?

Compounds 2,3,5,7: four.

Wait, but compound 4: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. If it's a meso compound, then it's achiral. So no optical activity.

So total of 4 compounds that exhibit optical activity: 2,3,5,7.

Wait, but the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4. So the correct answer would be 4, option D.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of asymmetry.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound has a double bond with (Z) configuration, but chirality requires a tetrahedral center. The carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and do not qualify as chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This compound contains stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (R) and (S) designations. These stereocenters make the molecule chiral, so it is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The central carbons (C2 and C3) are both chiral centers due to the presence of four different groups on each. This compound is **optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: While C2 and C3 are chiral centers, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters, so this compound is **not optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The hydroxyl group at C1 creates a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. This compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The molecule has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. However, the molecule is symmetric, as the hydroxyl groups are arranged in a trigonal pattern around the ring, making it a meso compound. This compound is **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The carbon at position 3 (C3) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group, a CH₂ group, and a hydrogen. This compound is **optically active**.

### Summary of Optical Activity:
- Compound 1: No  
- Compound 2: Yes  
- Compound 3: Yes  
- Compound 4: No  
- Compound 5: Yes  
- Compound 6: No  
- Compound 7: Yes  

### Total: **4 compounds exhibit optical activity**.

Answer: D
