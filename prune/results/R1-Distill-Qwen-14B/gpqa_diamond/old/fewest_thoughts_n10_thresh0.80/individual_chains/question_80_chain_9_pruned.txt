Okay, so I've got this question here about an algorithm that takes a DNA sequence as input and gives an output number. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I need to figure out what the algorithm is doing so that I can determine the output for the input ACAGTGACC. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, let's start by looking at the examples to see if I can find a pattern or rule that the algorithm is applying.

First, the input AGG. The output is 115. Let's break down the DNA sequence into individual nucleotides: A, G, G. Now, each of these letters represents a nucleotideâ€”A is Adenine, G is Guanine, C is Cytosine, T is Thymine. But how does that translate to a number?

Maybe each nucleotide has a numerical value. Let me think: sometimes in DNA problems, each base is assigned a number. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4 or something like that. Or perhaps it's based on their positions in the alphabet. A is the 1st letter, G is the 7th, etc. Let me check that.

Wait, A is the first letter, so 1. G is the 7th, so 7. Let's see, for AGG:

A=1, G=7, G=7. So 1 + 7 +7 = 15. But the output is 115. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Maybe it's each base multiplied by its position in the string. Like, for AGG, A is the first, so 1*1=1, G is second, 7*2=14, G third, 7*3=21. Summing these gives 1+14+21=36, which is not 115. Not matching.

Another possibility: perhaps each nucleotide is converted to its ASCII value. Let's see. The ASCII for 'A' is 65, 'G' is 71. So AGG would be 65 +71 +71. That's 65+71 is 136, plus another 71 is 207. Not 115. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of the ASCII codes, but perhaps only considering uppercase letters, but maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is mapped to a different numerical value. Let's think of another approach.

Another idea: perhaps each base is converted into a numerical value based on a different coding. For example, A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Then AGG would be
