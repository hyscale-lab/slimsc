Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these acid-base problems. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, that's a mix of an acid and a base, so I think I need to figure out whether the mixture is acidic or basic overall.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should probably calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see what's left after neutralization.

Let's start by finding the moles of each component. Moles are calculated as Molarity × Volume (in liters).

For the acetic acid (CH3COOH): it's a weak acid. Its formula is CH3COOH → it donates H+ ions. So the moles would be 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. But wait, since it's weak, it doesn't fully dissociate. But when mixed with strong acid or base, I might have to consider if it reacts. Hmm, but maybe in this case, since HCl is a strong acid, it will just add to the H+ concentration.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all the H+ and OH- ions each solution contributes.

So, let's calculate each component:

1. Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
   - Molarity = 0.1 M
   Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it will contribute some H+ ions, but maybe not all. But when mixed with a strong acid and a base, perhaps the strong acid (HCl) will dominate the H+ concentration, and the base (Ba(OH)2) will contribute OH-.

2. HCl (hydrochloric acid):
   - Strong acid, so it dissociates completely.
   - Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
   - Molarity = 0.2 M
   Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Each HCl gives 1 mole of H+, so moles H+ = 0.08.

3. Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide):
   - Strong base, so it dissociates completely.
   - Formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
   - Molarity = 0.3 M
   Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 moles OH-, so moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So now, I have contributions from each:
- H+ from CH3COOH: let's say it's negligible compared to the strong acid? Or do I need to account for it? Hmm, since HCl is a strong acid, its H+ will be much higher than the weak acid's. But maybe I should include it because when you add all the H+ and OH-, the neutralization will depend on the total.

Wait, but actually, the H+ from CH3COOH is not negligible in the presence of a base. Or maybe it is? Wait, because HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react first, and then any excess will
