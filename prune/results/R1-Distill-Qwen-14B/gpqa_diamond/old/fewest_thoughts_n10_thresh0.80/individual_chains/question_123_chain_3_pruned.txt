Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I need to find out how far the ejecta travels from the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames are non-accelerating, so no acceleration to worry about. Also, gravity is ignored, so we don't have to consider gravitational effects. That simplifies things a bit.

The ejecta is moving towards the center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But we need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, this involves time dilation, probably due to special relativity because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify the frames. The Galaxy is stationary in its own frame, and the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s according to the Galaxy. Or is it the other way around? Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards itâ€”so that should be the same speed but in opposite directions.

So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 0.2 times c, which is 20% the speed of light. So relativistic effects are noticeable here, but maybe not extremely so.

Wait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame over a certain time. But the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So I think we need to relate the time in one frame to the other using the Lorentz factor.

So, the time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (t') by the time dilation formula. Time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2
