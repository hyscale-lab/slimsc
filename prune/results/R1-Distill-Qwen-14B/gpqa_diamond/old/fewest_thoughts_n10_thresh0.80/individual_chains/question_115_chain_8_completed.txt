Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

So, an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, alright. Let's break this down.

First, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the electron, gamma_e is 4. For the positron, gamma_p is 2. But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so that would be in the opposite direction of the electron.

So when the electron and positron collide, they annihilate. Since they are each other's antiparticles, they produce gamma rays (photons). Now, photons are massless, and their energy and momentum are related by E = pc. So each photon will carry some energy and momentum in opposite directions, but in this case, the problem says both have the same energy. So E1 = E2.

Wait, but the directions are both towards the right, but one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their momenta vectors are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. That suggests that the system's momentum before annihilation must be along the horizontal axis. Because the photons' momenta might have components in y-direction, but their sum should cancel out if the initial system's momentum is along x.

Wait, but let me think about conservation laws. The total momentum before annihilation must equal the total momentum after. Similarly, energy must be conserved.

So let's compute the total momentum before.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, but we can also express it in terms of gamma and rest mass. Since for a relativistic particle, p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and since gamma = 4, m_e is the electron's mass.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the total momentum in terms of units where c=1, but I need to be careful.

Alternatively, since the electron and positron have the same mass, m_e = m_p = m. The positron is moving in the opposite direction, so we have to take their velocities and directions into account.

Wait, the Lorentz factor is given, which is gamma = 4 for the electron, gamma =2 for the positron.

Wait, but the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left, opposite to the electron's direction.

So to compute the total momentum, let me denote directions. Let me set the coordinate system: x-axis is horizontal, with the electron moving to the right (positive x-direction), and the positron moving to the left (negative x-direction).

Wait, no. The electron is moving from the left, so from the left towards the right, which is positive x. The positron is moving from the right towards the left, so negative x direction.

Wait, but Lorentz factors are just gamma, so the magnitudes. So for the electron, gamma_e =4, velocity v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e²) ). Similarly for the positron, gamma_p=2, v_p = c * sqrt(1 -1/(gamma_p^2)).

But perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and mass.

Momentum of a particle is p = gamma * m * v. But wait, v can be expressed in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4.

Similarly, beta_p = sqrt(1 -1/(gamma_p)^2) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c. Wait, but units: since in SI units, p = gamma m v. Hmm, but perhaps I can work in units where c=1 to simplify calculations, but let me think.

Alternatively, since when computing the direction and angles, the exact value of c and m might not matter, as long as I'm consistent.

Wait, but let's proceed.

The electron is moving to the right (positive x), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum P_total is p_e - p_p (since p_p is in the opposite direction).

Wait, but p_e is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and p_p is gamma_p * m_p * v_p. Since m_e = m_p (since positron is same mass as electron), we can write it as:

P_total = gamma_e * m_e * v_e - gamma_p * m_e * v_p.

We can factor m_e:

P_total = m_e (gamma_e v_e - gamma_p v_p).

But let me compute each term. Let's compute v_e and v_p in terms of c.

v_e = beta_e c = (sqrt(15)/4) c.

Similarly, v_p = beta_p c = (sqrt(3)/2) c.

Now, gamma_e is 4, so gamma_e v_e = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= sqrt(15) c.

gamma_p v_p = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2 c) )= sqrt(3) c.

So P_total = m_e (sqrt(15)c - sqrt(3) c) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So the total momentum before annihilation is in the positive x direction, because sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so their difference is positive.

Now, after annihilation, the two photons have the same energy, so same momentum magnitude since E=pc. Let me call the momentum of each photon as p1 and p2.

Each photon has energy E, so p1 = E/c, p2 = E/c.

But since photons carry momentum, the vector sum of their momenta must equal the initial momentum.

So the vectors p1 and p2 must add up to P_total.

But each photon's momentum vector is E/c times their direction unit vectors. So let's model their directions.

The photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Let me denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. Let the upper photon have an angle theta above the x-axis, and the lower one an angle theta below the x-axis. Because the problem states they are symmetric.

Wait, but the question says one is upper-right and another is lower-right. So they're both moving to the right, but one is above the x-axis, the other below. Wait, but wait, the initial momentum is positive x. So that could make sense. But wait, if they are moving to the right, their x-components would add to the initial momentum.

Wait, but if their directions are upper-right and lower-right, their x-components would be positive, and y-components would be opposite in direction. So their combined y-momentum would be zero, as the system's initial y-momentum is zero.

So yeah, that makes sense. So the two photons have symmetric angles theta above and below the x-axis.

Now, the momentum vectors of the photons are:

p1 = (E/c) (cos(theta), sin(theta)),

p2 = (E/c) (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).

So the total momentum after is p1 + p2 = (2 E cos(theta)/c, 0).

Wait, that's interesting. Because the y-components cancel, and the x-components add up.

Wait, but the initial total momentum was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction.

So setting the after momentum equal to that:

2 E cos(theta)/c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Solving for E:

E = [ m_e c² (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )

Wait, because m_e c is the term, and when we multiply by c, we get m_e c². Hmm, wait let me recheck.

Wait, the initial momentum was P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, no: P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So in the equation, 2 E cos(theta)/c = P_initial.

So 2 E cos(theta)/c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Solving for E:

E = [ m_e c² (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / (2 cos(theta) )

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this from the energy conservation perspective.

The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Each particle's energy is E = gamma m c². So the total energy is E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m c².

Plugging in the numbers: gamma_e =4, gamma_p=2, so E_initial=6 m c².

After annihilation, the photons have energy E each, so E_total = 2 E.

Conservation of energy: 2 E = 6 m c² → E = 3 m c².

Wait, that's a much easier approach. So each photon has energy E = 3 m c².

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if each photon has energy 3 m c², but the initial system had total energy 6 m c², that makes sense.

Wait, but wait a second. The electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their rest masses are adding to the total energy. But wait, in high-energy collisions, the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy contributes.

Wait, but when two particles annihilate, the rest mass energy (2 m c²) is converted into energy for the photons, but if they are moving, their kinetic energy also contributes.

Wait, but in this case, since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their kinetic energies add to the rest mass energy. So the total energy available is indeed sum of their energies.

So E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m c² = (4 +2) m c² =6 m c².

So after annihilation, the photons' total energy is 6 m c², so each photon has 3 m c².

So E_photon =3 m c².

Now, from the momentum conservation in the x-direction, we have:

sum p_x = P_initial → 2 E_photon cos(theta) / c = P_initial.

We already have P_initial as m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So plugging in E_photon =3 m c²,

2 * (3 m c²) * cos(theta) / c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

6 m c cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14093.

So 6 cos(theta)=2.14093 → cos(theta)=2.14093/6 ≈ 0.35682.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees. Because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)≈0.3420. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 68 degrees.

Wait, precise calculation: let's compute 69 degrees: cos(69)≈0.3584; 68 degrees: cos≈0.3746.

Wait, 0.3568 is slightly less than cos(69°), so perhaps around 69.3 degrees? Hmm, but maybe we don't need the exact value.

Wait, but the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, because each is at theta above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, no. Wait, the angle between the two photons would be the angle from one photon to the other. Since one is at theta above x-axis, the other is theta below. So the angle between them is 2 theta.

So if theta is about 69 degrees, then the angle between the two photons is about 138 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Alternatively, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) precisely.

sqrt(15)=3.872983346

sqrt(3)=1.732050808

Subtracting: 3.872983346 -1.732050808=2.140932538.

So 6 cos(theta)=2.140932538 → cos(theta)=2.140932538/6=0.35682209.

So theta = arccos(0.35682209) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute arccos(0.35682209):

Using a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2*theta≈138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, followed by the production of two photons. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.  
   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:  
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = (\gamma_e + \gamma_p) m c^2 = (4 + 2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2
     \]  
   - After annihilation, the total energy is carried by two photons of equal energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = 2 E_{\text{photon}} \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m c^2
     \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   - The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using the Lorentz factor and velocity relations, the momentum of each particle is:  
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m v_e, \quad p_p = \gamma_p m v_p
     \]  
     where \(v_e = \beta_e c = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c\) and \(v_p = \beta_p c = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c\).  
     Substituting, the total momentum is:  
     \[
     P_{\text{initial}} = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]  

3. **Photon Momentum and Symmetry**:  
   - After annihilation, the two photons have equal energy and symmetric directions with respect to the x-axis. Let the angle each photon makes with the x-axis be \(\theta\).  
   - The x-components of the photons' momenta add up to conserve momentum, while the y-components cancel out. The total momentum after annihilation is:  
     \[
     P_{\text{final}} = \frac{2 E_{\text{photon}}}{c} \cos\theta
     \]  
     Setting \(P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}}\):  
     \[
     \frac{2 (3 m c^2)}{c} \cos\theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]  
     Simplifying:  
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}
     \]  
     Substituting \(\sqrt{15} \approx 3.873\) and \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):  
     \[
     \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.141 \quad \implies \quad \cos\theta = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.357
     \]  
     Thus, \(\theta \approx \arccos(0.357) \approx 69^\circ\).

4. **Angle Between Photons**:  
   - Since the photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the angle between them is \(2\theta\).  
     \[
     \text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   Comparing with the options, the angle between the photons is **138 degrees**.

Answer: C
