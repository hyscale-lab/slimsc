Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this concept, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. They can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same arrangement but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's break them down.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structural isomers. It usually occurs in compounds with adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems. Like how ketones can tautomerize into enols or something.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be 1,4-benzoquinone or para, which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, would that allow for tautomerism? I'm not entirely sure, but I think quinones can have some tautomerism because of the adjacent ketones. But wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a conjugated system, so maybe it can tautomerize. Or maybe not because the positions are fixed in the ring.

Then there's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, it's symmetric. Does this structure allow for tautomerism? Let me think. If all three ketones are in alternating positions, maybe the ring can't easily tautomerize because all the adjacent carbons are carbonyls. Wait, no, tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is adjacent to another, so perhaps each C=O is next to another C=O. So, maybe each carbon is part of a conjugated system, but can they shift? Or would it be impossible because all positions are occupied?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Tautomerism usually requires at least two hydrogen atoms adjacent to the carbonyl group. For example, in a diketone, you can have enol tautomerism. Like, for example, in 1,3-diketones, which can form enols. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is adjacent to another, so maybe there's no available hydrogen to form an enol. Because each carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, and the adjacent carbons are also double-bonded, so maybe no H's are available for tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, on the other hand, has the two ketones in para positions. So, the adjacent carbons are each connected to a benzene ring. Wait, each of those carbons would have a hydrogen, right? Because in the benzene ring, each carbon has one hydrogen unless substituted otherwise. So, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize because each ketone is attached to a carbon that is part of a benzene ring, but adjacent carbons have Hs. Wait, but in the case of benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene ring. So, if you have a benzene ring with two opposite ketones, maybe each of those carbons is adjacent only to the ring carbons which are sp² hybridized. So, would those carbons have hydrogens that are acidic enough to allow tautomerism?

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize into something else. Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Wait, another approach: which of these compounds has the possibility of enol tautomerism?

Benzoquinone (like 1,4-benzoquinone) has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. So, each of the carbonyl groups is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. So, if the ring is conjugated, maybe the carbonyl groups can tautomerize. But wait, for an enol form, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. In benzoquinone, the carbons next to the carbonyls are part of the benzene ring, which implies that those positions are sp² hybridized. So, do they have any hydrogens that are alpha? Let me think: in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen (for benzene itself). But in benzoquinone, those positions next to the carbonyl (like positions 2 and 6 for the 1 and 4 positions) would be part of the ring. So, those carbons are each bonded to two other ring carbons and one oxygen (from the carbonyl). So, perhaps those positions don't have any hydrogens because all their bonds are taken up. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in benzene, each carbon has one H. When it's benzoquinone, two of the ring carbons are double-bonded to O, so they don't have Hs. But the adjacent positions (like 2 and 6 for carbonyl at 1) would each have one H, right? Because they're still part of the ring.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Let me imagine the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone. It's a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4. So, the ring is as follows: O=C-C6H4-CO. So, the two ketones are opposite each other. The adjacent positions (2 and 6, 3 and 5) would each have H's. So, each of these Hs is adjacent to a carbonyl group?

Wait, no. The carbons next to the carbonyl are the ones attached to the carbonyl group. So, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyls are at 1 and 4. So, the carbons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to the carbonyl at 1. So, each of these positions (2 and 6) is bonded to the carbonyl at 1. So, the carbons at 2 and 6 have H's. Therefore, each of these Hs is alpha to a carbonyl group.

So, these H's can be involved in tautomerism. So, the enol form would involve the transfer of a hydrogen from position 2 to position 1, but wait, no. Tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen from one position to another, adjacent to a double bond or carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the enol form would involve the loss of a hydrogen from position 2 (which is adjacent to the carbonyl at 1) and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait,
