Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let's see... The question is about Lorentz factors and how particles reach the detector walls. Hmm, I remember that Lorentz factor is gamma, which relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity.

So, the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls? The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, so the current situation is gamma ~20, and 1/3 reach the walls. We need to find the gamma where 2/3 reach.

I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to decay versus the time it takes for them to reach the detector walls. If the particles are moving fast, they might not decay quickly enough to escape the detector before decaying, or they might decay within the detector.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the particles are fast-decaying. So, if they decay quickly, they might not get far. But the detector radius is 30 meters. So the time they take to reach the wall is related to their speed. If their lifetime is such that they only survive for a certain amount of proper time, then the observed time would be longer due to time dilation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The particles are created at the center, so they have to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. They move at a speed determined by their Lorentz factor. If they decay before reaching the wall, they don't make it. So the fraction that reach depends on whether their lifetime is long enough, considering their speed.

So, for a given gamma, the particles' lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime (tau). So if the proper lifetime is tau, the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, but the particles are moving at a speed v. The time they take to reach the wall is t = R / v, where R is
