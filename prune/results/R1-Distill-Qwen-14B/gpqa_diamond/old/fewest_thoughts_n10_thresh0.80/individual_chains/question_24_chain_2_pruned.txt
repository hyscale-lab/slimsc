Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack all the information given and see where it leads me.

First, the problem describes two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When X is treated with platinum under heat, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids but doesn't decolorize bromine water. 

So, what does decolorizing bromine water mean? I remember that bromine water is a solution of bromine in water, and it's commonly used to test for unsaturation in alkenes and alkynes. Alkenes and alkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons that can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So, if a substance decolorizes bromine water, it likely has double or triple bonds.

But wait, mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so the two liquids in X must have either double bonds or triple bonds. When treated with platinum and heat, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, this probably leads to the addition of hydrogen across these double or triple bonds. Oh, but wait, the product mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water anymore. That suggests that the reaction has converted the unsaturated bonds into single bonds. So, the reaction is hydrogenation, adding H2 across double or triple bonds.

So, X is a mixture of alkenes or alkynes because they can decolorize bromine water. Y is the product after hydrogenation, so they're alkanes. But wait, the problem says that Y is a result of a disproportionation. Hmm. Disproportionation is a reaction where an element is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe one of the components in X is undergoing such a reaction.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, the question says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So maybe X contains alkenes and another unsaturated compound which, under hydrogenation, forms more than just addition of H2. But then Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, that part is a bit confusing.

Wait, let me re-read that. Treatment with Pt when heated causes a disproportionation, forming Y as a mixture of two liquids. So, perhaps one of the components in X is undergoing a disproportionation when hydrogenated.

Wait, but hydrogenation is typically an addition reaction where H2 adds across double bonds. Maybe if a compound has more than one type of unsaturated bond, like maybe a conjugated diene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps one of the components is a diene and the other is something else, and upon hydrogenation, they form different products.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't just simple hydrogenation. Let me think about what kind of reactions occur with Pt catalysts. Oh, another possibility is that the treatment with H2 and Pt is for hydrogenation, but maybe under certain conditions, such as high temperature or pressure, different products form.

Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same substance Z. Wait, the question says: "Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z... which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent."

So, Z is a product of both X and Y when they undergo hydrogenation under more severe conditions. And Z is a constituent of Y. So, perhaps X's hydrogenation under severe conditions gives Z, which is already part of Y. Or maybe Y's hydrogenation gives Z, but wait, no. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky.

Wait, the problem says that when X is hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z, and when Y is hydrogenated under the same severe conditions, it also gives Z. So, Z is the product of both X and Y's hydrogenation. But Z is already a component of Y. Interesting.

Wait, but if Y is a mixture of two alkanes (since X is hydrogenated into alkanes?), then why would hydrogenating Y give the same Z as when X is hydrogenated? Because maybe one of the components in Y is Z, and hydrogenating Y would further hydrogenate any unsaturated bonds, but if Y's components are already saturated, maybe that's not the case. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me restructure the information:

1. X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, they have double or triple bonds.

2. X is treated with Pt and heated, causing a disproportionation reaction, leading to Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that do NOT decolorize bromine water. So Y's components are saturated (alkanes), because they don't react with bromine.

3. Hydrogenation of X and Y under severe conditions gives Z, which is a hydrocarbon, mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, Z must be a saturated compound, since it doesn't react with H2.

So, what is Z? Let's compute its formula. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, if the molecular formula is CxHy, then (y/(12x + y)) * 100 = 14.28%. Let's solve for that.

Let me compute: 14.28 = (y) / (12x + y) * 100.

Divide both sides by 100: 0.1428 = y / (12x + y)

Multiply both sides by denominator: 0.1428*(12x + y) = y

0.1428 *12x + 0.1428 y = y

1.7136 x = y - 0.1428 y = 0.8572 y

So 1.7136 x = 0.8572 y

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

(1.7136 / 0.8572) x = y

Approximately,

1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2

So y ≈ 2x.

So the formula is approximately CxH2x. So possible for x=3, y=6: C3H6? No, but wait, H2O is 14.28% H, but that's another matter.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach: 14.28% is 1/7, so H is 1/7 of the molecular mass.

So, molecular mass M = (mass of H) / (1/7) = 7 * (H's mass). Wait, more accurately, the mass of H is 14.28% of M.

So (mass of H) = 0.1428 * M.

Mass of H is (y * 1) g/mol.

So, y = 0.1428 * M.

But M = 12x + y.

So,

y = 0.1428*(12x + y)

Multiply both sides by 1000 to avoid decimals:

1000 y = 142.8*(12x + y)

Divide both sides by 1000:

y = 0.1428*(12x + y)

Same as before.

Let me rearrange:

y = (142.8 * 12x + 142.8 y) / 1000

Multiply both sides by 1000:

1000 y = 1713.6 x + 142.8 y

Subtract 142.8 y:

857.2 y = 1713.6 x

So, y = (1713.6 / 857.2) x ≈ 2x

So, y ≈ 2x.

So, the formula is CxH2x. Let's see possible small x.

x=1: CH2. Not possible.

x=2: C2H4. That's ethylene, but Z is a constituent of Y, which is a product after hydrogenation. So Y is a mixture of alkanes.

Wait, but C2H4 is an alkene. If Y's components are alkanes, then Z must be an alkane. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should think of another approach. Let me think of possible hydrocarbons where the mass of H is 14.28%.

Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7. Let's think of CH3CH2CH3 (propane). Let's compute the hydrogen percentage.

Propane: C3H8.

Molar mass = 3*12 +8*1=36 +8=44 g/mol.

Hydrogen mass is 8 g. 8/44 = 0.1818 or 18.18%. Not 14.28%.

Wait, ethane: C2H6. Molar mass 24 +6=30.

Hydrogen mass:6/30=0.2 =>20%. Closer but not exact.

Methane: CH4. Molar mass 16. Hydrogen is 4/16=0.25 =>25%. No.

What about C4H10? Molar mass 58. H mass is 10/58≈0.1724 or 17.24%. Closer, but not 14.28%.

Wait, maybe a cycloalkane? Let's think.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic compound with the same formula as an alkene but different structure. Alternatively, perhaps a different approach is needed.

Wait, 14.28% is 1/7. So, the mass of H is 1/7 of the mass of the molecule.

So,

Mass of H = (1/7) * M.

But, M = 12x + y.

So,

y = (1/7)(12x + y).

Multiply both sides by 7:

7y =12x + y.

6y=12x → y=2x.

So yes, same as before. So, the formula is CxH2x.

Wait, but for that formula, the molecular formula must be such that H is 2x.

So, for x=3, H=6 → C3H6, which is a cyclic compound (like cyclopropane) or an alkene. But cyclopropane has a ring, which is saturated.

Wait, cyclopropane is a saturated compound because it's a single ring, but it's a three-membered ring with each bond having some double bond character. Hmm, but in any case, cyclopropane is quite strained.

But wait, if Z is a constituent of Y, which is formed by the disproportionation of X after hydrogenation, perhaps Z is a product of further hydrogenation of X.

Wait, but the problem states that Z is a constituent of Y, so Y must contain Z. But Y is a mixture of two alkanes because it doesn't react with bromine water. So, Z must be an alkane. But according to the formula, Z's formula is CxH2x.

Wait, alkanes have the formula CxH2x+2. Wait, so H2x is less than that. So, if the formula is CxH2x, that's an alkene or an alkyne. But Z is a constituent of Y, which is a mixture of alkanes. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the problem.

The problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Then, when X and Y are each hydrogenated under severe conditions, they both give Z. Z is a constituent of Y, which is a mixture of alkanes. So, Z must be an alkane, as it's part of Y.

But the formula suggests that Z is of the form CxH2x. But alkanes are CnH2n+2. So, the only way CxH2x is an alkane is if 2x = 2n+2 → x = n+1, which implies that 2x = 2(n+1) = 2n+2. Wait, that can't be because 2x is 2x, but 2n+2 is for alkanes.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me compute for Z.

If Z is an alkane, then its formula is CnH2n+2.

The mass fraction of H is (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2) = (2n+2)/(14n +2) = (n+1)/(7n +1).

We have to
