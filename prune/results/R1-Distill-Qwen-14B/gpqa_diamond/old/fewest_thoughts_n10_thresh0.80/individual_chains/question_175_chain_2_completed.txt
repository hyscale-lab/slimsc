Alright, I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. The problem is about finding the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle theta, which is 30 degrees, and also determining the form of the function f that describes the power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

Hmm, okay, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the frequency or wavelength of the oscillation and the direction from which you measure it. The radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis of oscillation, which in this case is the z-axis.

So the question asks for two things: the fraction of the maximum power (A) at theta =30 degrees, and the form of the function f, which represents the power per unit solid angle. The options give possible fractions and possible dependencies on lambda.

Wait, I think I should recall some concepts here. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum along the equator (theta = 90 degrees) and minimum along the axis (theta=0 or 180). The radiation pattern usually has a sin^2(theta) dependence. But wait, that's for a dipole's radiation. However, in this case, the charge distribution is spheroidal, which might imply a different radiation pattern.

Wait, maybe it's a dipole-like oscillation. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole has a certain dependence. Oh right, the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to (1/(lambda^4)) multiplied by sin^2(theta). Oh wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think.

The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The total power is ( ( (μ₀/(4π)) ) ( ( q² a² )/(6c³) ) ), but when considering the direction, the radiation pattern comes into play. The radiation pattern for a dipole is such that the intensity (power per unit area) in the far zone (radiation zone) is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and falls off as sin^2(theta) as you move towards the poles.

Wait, but the question is about the power per unit solid angle. Since solid angle is dΩ = sin(theta) dtheta dphi, the power radiated into a solid angle dΩ would be P dΩ = (some function) sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

Wait, the function f would be the power per unit solid angle, so f(theta) = P/(dΩ) = (something) sin(theta) theta function? Or maybe f(theta) is proportional to sin(theta) or something else. Wait, I think for a dipole, the intensity (which is power per unit area) in the far field is proportional to sin^2(theta). But the power per unit solid angle is different because to get intensity you have to divide by the area of the sphere (since dΩ = sin theta dtheta dphi).

Wait, let me think again. The power radiated into a solid angle dΩ is given by P = (something) * (sin^2(theta)) * dΩ. So the function f would be proportional to sin^2(theta), but wait, no: because if f is the power per unit solid angle, then f(theta) = P/(dΩ) = (something) * sin^2(theta) * (1/(sin theta)) ) because dΩ = sin theta dtheta dphi. So f(theta) would be proportional to sin(theta). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the intensity (which is power per unit area) is proportional to sin^2(theta). But the power per unit solid angle is different because solid angle is an area measure on the unit sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for the radiation pattern. For a dipole, the radiation pattern (intensity) is given by I = I0 sin^2(theta), where I0 is the maximum intensity. So the maximum intensity occurs at theta=90 degrees, and the intensity is zero at theta=0 and 180.

But what is the power per unit solid angle? Wait, the intensity I is the power per unit area, which is different from the power per unit solid angle. Let me think: the power in a solid angle dΩ is I * dA, where dA is the area of that solid angle on the unit sphere. But since dA = r² dΩ, but in the far field, the intensity is I = (some factor) * (1/lambda²) sin²(theta), I think. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the power per unit solid angle is the same as the intensity multiplied by the square of the distance, but in the far field, the intensity is uniform across the sphere, so perhaps the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's approach this differently. The total power radiated is A, which is the maximum. The maximum occurs where the intensity is maximum, which for a dipole is at theta=90 degrees.

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f(theta) dΩ is the power in that solid angle. The total power A is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. So A = ∫ f(theta) dΩ.

If the maximum power is A, then the maximum f(theta) must be at theta where the integral is maximum. But wait, the maximum power in a certain direction is when f(theta) is maximum. Alternatively, the maximum f(theta) would correspond to the maximum intensity, which for a dipole is at theta=90.

Wait, the question says the maximum power radiated is A. So at theta=30 degrees, what fraction of A is radiated?

Wait, no. The question says "the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees."

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f(theta) gives the power per unit solid angle at angle theta. The maximum value of f(theta) is A, perhaps? Or is A the total power, and the maximum per solid angle is A multiplied by something else?

Wait, looking back at the question: "the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees and a possible form of f are, respectively..."

Wait, perhaps the maximum value of f(theta) is A, but that doesn't make sense because f is per unit solid angle. Alternatively, perhaps A is the total power, and the function f is A times some function. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function f is (something) multiplied by A. So, the max power is A, and f(theta) = A * something that depends on theta and lambda.

Wait, perhaps the total radiated power A is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. So A = ∫ f(theta) dΩ. Then f(theta) would be the power per unit solid angle, and the maximum value of f(theta) would be A divided by the minimum solid angle, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe A is the maximum power per unit solid angle, so f(theta) <= A. Then the fraction of A at theta=30 is f(30)/A.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think about what I know about dipole radiation.

In dipole radiation, the intensity (power per unit area) is given by I = ( ( μ0 q² a² )/( 12 π c³ ) ) * (1/(4π r²)) * sin²(theta), but in the far field, r is large, so the intensity falls off as 1/r². Wait, but in this problem, it's about the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity multiplied by r² (since dA = r² sin theta dtheta dphi). So the power per unit solid angle would be I * (r²) * dOmega, but wait, that would be P = I * dA = I * r² dΩ. But for a given r, the power per unit solid angle would be I * r², but that doesn't make sense because for the same r, I is uniform in that sense. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps in the far zone, the power per unit solid angle is given by ( ( q² a² )/( c^3 ) ) * (1/(4 π epsilon_0 )) * ( sin^2(theta) ) / (4 pi) )? Or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta), but scaled by some lambda factor.

Wait, the problem says the function f is a function of lambda and theta. So the power per unit solid angle depends on both the wavelength and the angle.

From my notes, the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta) / lambda^4. Because the power is proportional to (a^2)/(c^3), and a is the acceleration, which for oscillation at frequency f is a = (2 pi^2 q^2 f^2)/m. Hmm, but maybe I should think in terms of lambda. Since c = f lambda, so f = c/lambda.

Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is ( ( μ0 q² a² )/( 12 π c³ ) ), but a is the acceleration, which for simple harmonic motion is a = (omega^2) q, where omega is the angular frequency. Omega is 2 pi f, and f is c/lambda. So a ~ (c^2)/(lambda^2).

Substituting into the power formula, the power becomes proportional to (1/lambda^4), because a^2 is (c^4)/(lambda^4), and c is in the denominator as c^3, so overall, 1/lambda^4.

So the function f should have a dependence of lambda^(-4), which is 1/lambda^4.

Now, the other part is the fraction of the maximum power at theta=30 degrees. The maximum power occurs where the function f is maximum. For a dipole, f(theta) is maximum at theta=90 degrees, so f(theta=90) is the maximum, A.

The function f(theta) = K * sin^2(theta), where K is a factor involving lambda^(-4). So f(theta) = K * sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4).

So at theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin^2(theta)=0.25.

So the power per unit solid angle at theta=30 is (K * 0.25) * (1/lambda^4), which is a quarter of the maximum value (since maximum is when sin^2(theta)=1, so 1).

But wait, the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A. So the maximum value of f(theta) is A, so the value at theta=30 is A/4. Therefore, the fraction is (A/4)/A = 1/4.

Wait, but wait, is A the maximum value of f(theta)? Because the question says the maximum power radiated is A. So if f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, then the maximum f(theta) is A. Then, at theta=30, it's A * (1/4), so the fraction is (A/4)/A) = 1/4.

Wait, but the question says, the fraction of A that will be radiated at theta=30 degrees. Hmm, no, that's not correct. Because A is the maximum power, which is the maximum value of f(theta) multiplied by the solid angle. Wait, no. If f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, then the total power is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. So A is the total power. Then, the power at theta=30 is f(theta) * (dΩ), but that's not correct because f is per unit solid angle, so the power in a small solid angle dΩ is f(theta) dΩ.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused again.

Let me rephrase: The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power A is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. So A = ∫ f(theta) dΩ.

If f(theta) = K sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4), then A = K (1/lambda^4) ∫ sin^2(theta) dΩ.

The integral ∫ sin^2(theta) dΩ over all solid angles is ∫ (from theta=0 to pi) sin^2(theta) * 2 pi sin theta d theta.

So compute this integral: 2 pi ∫ (from 0 to pi) sin^3(theta) d theta.

Wait, ∫ sin^3(theta) d theta from 0 to pi is 4/3.

So the integral becomes 2 pi * (4/3) )= (8 pi /3) ?

Wait, let me compute it step by step. The integral of sin^3(theta) d theta from 0 to pi.

Let me make substitution u = cos(theta), then du = -sin(theta) d theta.

Expressing sin^3(theta) as sin^2(theta) * sin(theta) = (1 - u^2) (-du)

So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - u^2) (-du) from u=1 to u=-1.

Which is ∫ (1 - u^2) du from u=-1 to u=1.

Compute that: [u - (u^3)/3 ] from -1 to 1.

At 1: 1 - (1/3) = 2/3.

At -1: (-1) - [ (-1)^3 /3 ] = -1 - (-1/3) = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3.

Subtracting: (2/3) - (-2/3) )= 4/3.

So the integral of sin^3(theta) from 0 to pi is 4/3.

So the total integral for A is K (1/lambda^4) * (8 pi/3) ) = K (8 pi /3 ) (1/lambda^4) ) = A.

But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. Wait, no, the maximum power is the maximum value of f(theta), which is when sin^2(theta) is 1 (theta=90 degrees), so f(theta=90)= K (1/lambda^4) * 1 = K (1/lambda^4) = A.

Wait, that's a key point. So A is the maximum value of f(theta), which is when theta=90 degrees.

So A = K (1/lambda^4).

Then, the function f(theta) = A sin^2(theta).

So the power radiated at any angle theta is f(theta) = A sin^2(theta).

At theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=1/2, so sin^2(theta)=1/4. Thus, f(30) = A * 1/4.

But wait, the question is asking what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30. So, the power at theta=30 is (A/4), and the total power is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles.

Wait no, the total power A is given as the maximum power, but according to the function f(theta), the maximum is A. So I think the function f(theta) is expressed as f(theta) = A sin^2(theta).

So the total power is ∫ f(theta) dΩ = ∫ A sin^2(theta) dΩ.

Wait, let's compute that integral. The solid angle element dΩ is sin theta d theta d phi. So the integral becomes A ∫0^pi ∫0^{2pi} sin^2(theta) sin theta d theta d phi.

Which is A * 2 pi ∫0^pi sin^3(theta) d theta.

Which we already computed as 4/3, so total integral is A * 2 pi * (4/3) ) = A * (8 pi/3).

Wait, that can't be. Because according to this, the total power would be A multiplied by (8 pi/3), which would make the total power much larger than A.

But the question states that the maximum power is A. So perhaps my assumption that A is the maximum of f(theta) is incorrect. Maybe the maximum power refers to the total power, not the maximum per solid angle.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it differently. Let's think about the radiation pattern.

The power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta) and inversely proportional to lambda^4.

So f(theta) = C sin^2(theta) / lambda^4.

The maximum value of f(theta) occurs at theta=90 degrees, which is C / lambda^4. Let's call this maximum value f_max = C/lambda^4.

The total power A is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. So A = ∫ f(theta) dΩ = ∫ (C sin^2(theta)/lambda^4) * sin theta d theta d phi.

A = (C/lambda^4) ∫ sin^3(theta) d theta d phi.

∫0^{2pi} d phi = 2 pi.

∫0^pi sin^3(theta) d theta = 4/3.

So A = (C/lambda^4) * 2 pi * (4/3) ) = (8 pi C)/(3 lambda^4).

But from earlier, f_max = C/lambda^4.

So A = (8 pi/3) f_max.

But wait, the question states that A is the maximum power. Wait, but A is the total power radiated. So in this case, the function f(theta) has a maximum of f_max = C/lambda^4, and the total power is (8 pi/3) (C/lambda^4) ) = (8 pi/3) f_max.

So if A is the total power, then A = (8 pi/3) f_max.

But the question says the maximum power thus radiated is A. So perhaps the maximum power refers to the maximum value of f(theta) multiplied by the solid angle around that maximum. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the maximum f(theta) is per unit solid angle.

Wait, perhaps the maximum power refers to the maximum value of the power in any direction. So, for each direction, the power is f(theta) dΩ, but that's not correct because f is per unit solid angle. So, the power in a small solid angle dΩ is f(theta) dΩ.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

The problem says the maximum power is A. So the maximum value of f(theta) is A?

If so, then at theta=90 degrees, f(theta)=A. At other angles, f(theta) = A sin^2(theta).

Then, the total power is ∫ f(theta) dΩ = ∫ A sin^2(theta) dΩ.

Which we computed as A * (8 pi/3), which would mean the total power is (8 pi/3) A.

But the question says that the maximum power is A. So this suggests that the maximum power is A, and the function f(theta) is such that when integrated over all solid angles, gives the total power, which might be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of f(theta) as a function where the maximum value is A. So f(theta) = A sin^2(theta) * (something involving lambda).

Wait, but the problem says f is a function of lambda and theta. So the function f could be A sin^2(theta) times some factor that depends on lambda.

Wait, the function f is given to be a function of lambda and theta. So f(theta) = (something) * sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4). And the maximum value of f is A.

So f(theta) = A sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4) / something.

Wait, no. Let me try a different approach. Let's say the function f(theta) is (some constant) * sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4). The maximum value of this is when sin^2(theta) is 1, so f(theta) at maximum is (some constant) * (1/lambda^4). This maximum is given as A.

So, (some constant) = A * lambda^4.

Thus, f(theta) = A * lambda^4 * sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4 ) = A sin^2(theta).

Hence, f(theta) is A sin^2(theta).

Wait, that makes sense. So the function f(theta) = A sin^2(theta), and the maximum is A (at theta=90 degrees). The dependency on lambda is (1/lambda^4), because f(theta) is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Wait, but wait, in this scenario, f(theta) doesn't depend on lambda except through the maximum A. Hmm, but the problem states that f is a function of lambda and theta. So perhaps A is itself a function of lambda. Like A = B * (1/lambda^4), so that f(theta) = B * (1/lambda^4) * sin^2(theta).

In that case, f(theta) would be (1/lambda^4) multiplied by a function of theta, which is sin^2(theta), and scaled by a constant.

But the question gives options for f's dependency on lambda, such as lambda^(-4), etc.

So, given that, the function f would be proportional to sin^2(theta) and 1/lambda^4. So the form would be sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4), so the answer would be lambda^(-4).

Now, the fraction of the maximum power at theta=30 degrees is f(theta=30)/A.

At theta=30, sin^2(theta)= (1/2)^2=1/4.

So f(theta=30) = A * (1/4) * (1/lambda^4) * (lambda^4?), wait, no. Wait, in our earlier analysis, f(theta) = A sin^2(theta), where A is the maximum. So A is a constant, but in reality, A depends on lambda as (1/lambda^4) because the power scales with that.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me try to think of f(theta) as (some expression) that includes lambda.

If the maximum power is A, and A is the maximum value of f(theta), then A = f(theta=90) = K * 1 * (1/lambda^4), where K is some constant.

Thus, K = A * lambda^4.

So f(theta) = K * sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4) ) = (A lambda^4) * sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4) ) = A sin^2(theta).

So f(theta) = A sin^2(theta).

Thus, the function f is A sin^2(theta), which is independent of lambda, but that's not matching the problem statement because f is a function of lambda and theta.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is [something depending on lambda] multiplied by [something depending on theta].

Wait, perhaps the function f is (1/lambda^4) multiplied by sin^2(theta), and the maximum value of this is A. So, A = (1/lambda^4) * 1. So, (1/lambda^4) = A. Thus, f(theta) = A sin^2(theta).

In that case, the fraction of the maximum power at theta=30 would be (A * (1/4)) ) / A = 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to 1/lambda^4 and sin^2(theta). So looking at the options:

Option C says 1/4 and lambda^(-4).

So the answer would be C.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, spheroidal in shape, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. It radiates at a wavelength $\lambda$, and the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ of $\lambda$ and the angle $\theta$ (measured from the z-axis). The task is to determine the fraction of the maximum power $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ and the form of $f(\lambda, \theta)$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Power per Unit Solid Angle**:
   - For an oscillating charge distribution, the power radiated per unit solid angle depends on the wavelength $\lambda$ and the angle $\theta$. The radiation pattern is symmetric around the z-axis.
   - For a dipole-like oscillation, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to $\sin^2(\theta)$ and inversely proportional to $\lambda^4$. Thus, the function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ can be expressed as:
     \[
     f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\lambda^4}.
     \]
   - The maximum power radiated per unit solid angle occurs at $\theta = 90^\circ$, where $\sin^2(\theta) = 1$. This maximum value is given as $A$.

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at $\theta = 30^\circ$**:
   - At $\theta = 30^\circ$, $\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$, so $\sin^2(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{4}$.
   - The power radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is proportional to $\frac{1}{4}$ of the maximum power $A$. Therefore, the fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is:
     \[
     \text{Fraction} = \frac{\text{Power at } \theta = 30^\circ}{A} = \frac{A \cdot \frac{1}{4}}{A} = \frac{1}{4}.
     \]

3. **Form of the Function $f(\lambda, \theta)$**:
   - From the analysis, $f(\lambda, \theta)$ is proportional to $\sin^2(\theta)$ and $\lambda^{-4}$. Thus, the function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ has the form:
     \[
     f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\lambda^4}.
     \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: $\frac{1}{2}, \lambda^{-4}$  
  Incorrect. The fraction of $A$ at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $\frac{1}{4}$, not $\frac{1}{2}$.
  
- **Option B**: $\frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-3}$  
  Incorrect. While the fraction $\frac{1}{4}$ is correct, the dependence on $\lambda$ is $\lambda^{-4}$, not $\lambda^{-3}$.
  
- **Option C**: $\frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-4}$  
  Correct. The fraction of $A$ at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $\frac{1}{4}$, and the function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ depends on $\lambda^{-4}$.
  
- **Option D**: $\frac{3}{4}, \lambda^{-6}$  
  Incorrect. The fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ is incorrect, and the dependence on $\lambda$ is $\lambda^{-4}$, not $\lambda^{-6}$.

### Final Answer:
The fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $\frac{1}{4}$, and the function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ depends on $\lambda^{-4}$. 

**Answer: C**
