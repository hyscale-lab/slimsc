Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think this is a 3x1 vector since there are three elements. The matrices for the operators P and Q are provided. The question is about measuring P first and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Hmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue for an observable is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state. But wait, when you measure P first, does that change the state for the subsequent measurement of Q?

I remember that when you perform a measurement, the state collapses into an eigenvector of the measured operator if the observable is measured. So if I measure P first, the state will collapse to an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue I measured. Then, measuring Q after would be on this new state.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the probability of getting exactly 0 for P and -1 for Q. So I need to find the probability of the measurement outcomes P=0 and Q=-1 in sequence.

First, I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q. Let me start with operator P.

The matrix for P has elements:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2
