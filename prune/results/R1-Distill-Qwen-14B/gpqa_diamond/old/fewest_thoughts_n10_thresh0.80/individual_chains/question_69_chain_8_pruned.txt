Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰ which decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. 

The given data: the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D with different resolutions. 

Wait, right, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving at high speeds, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So the gamma factor comes into play here.

I remember the formula for time dilation is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is equal to E/(m c²), maybe? Because E is the total energy, which for a relativistic particle would be gamma times m c². Oh right, because E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²). 

Wait, but the energy here is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 times 7.9 is about 27 (since 3.41*8=27.28, which is a bit higher). So approximately 7.9, maybe 7.93 or so. Let's compute it more accurately: 3.41 * 7.9 ≈ 3.41*(7 + 0.9) = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939, which is about 26.94, and since E is 27 GeV, then gamma is about 27/3.41 = approx 7.918. So gamma is roughly 7.92.

So the lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by tau_0. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.92 *8 is 63.36. So τ ≈63.36e-16 s or 6.336e-15 s.

But wait, what's the next step? Oh right, the decay length. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It's calculated by multiplying the speed of the particle by the lifetime. Since the speed is approximately the speed of light for high-energy particles, we can approximate it as c. 

So decay length L = v * τ ≈ c * τ. The speed v is roughly c, so L ≈ c * τ. 

Calculating that: c is about 3e8 m/s. So
