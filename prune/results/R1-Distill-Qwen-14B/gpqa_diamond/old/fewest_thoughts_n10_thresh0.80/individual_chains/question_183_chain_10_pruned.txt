Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the index of hydrogen deficiency. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each degree can be a ring or a double bond or a triple bond, but triple bonds count as two. So, the formula is Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.

The question gives me a compound: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it.

Breaking it down: It's a cyclohexene ring. So, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. Then, at position 3, there's an ene, which I think means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the ring has a double bond.

Then, substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is a CHO group. Then at position 5, a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, right? So, that's another double bond.

Wait, so the structure would be a cyclohexene ring. Let me draw it mentally. Carbon 1, then 2, which has a formyl group (CHO attached), then 3,4 with a double bond because it's cyclohex-3-ene. Then, carbon 5 has a vinyl substituent, which is CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So that's another double bond.

So the starting molecule has:

- A cyclohexene ring (one double bond)
- A formyl group (CHO) at C2
- A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at C5

So, the molecule has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring's double bond, the formyl group's double bond (CHO), and the vinyl group's double bond. Wait, or is the vinyl group's double bond already considered?

Wait, the structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So
