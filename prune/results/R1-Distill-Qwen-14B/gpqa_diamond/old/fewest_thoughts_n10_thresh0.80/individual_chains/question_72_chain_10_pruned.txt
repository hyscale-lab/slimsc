Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what's going on.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from a compound and going through several steps, ending up with product 4. The main goal is to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

First, I'll try to break down each reaction step. Let's go one by one.

Step 1: The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Hmm, okay. So the starting molecule has a bicyclo structure, which I think is norbornene. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group on position 7. I remember that norbornene derivatives can undergo Diels-Alder reactions because they're dienes.

Wait, the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let me visualize that. So cyclohexa-1,3-diene, which has two double bonds? Or wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a diene with conjugated double bonds. Each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group attached. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group? Because dibromomethyl is CH2Br2.

So when sodium iodide is present, especially with dibromides, I think it's a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Wait, but wait: the Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. Oh wait, but in this case, the starting material is a diene (norbornene derivative) and the other component is a dienophile? Or maybe not. Alternatively, since the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of coupling or substitution.

Wait, when you have 2 equivalents of the dienophile, maybe the norbornene is acting as the diene. So the initial step might be a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening metathesis? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, but in this context, perhaps it's acting as a catalyst for elimination or substitution. Alternatively, maybe the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Let me think: if the cyclohexene has two leaving groups (like Br), perhaps it's undergoing a coupling reaction when the norbornene attacks.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornene is the diene and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile? Or perhaps the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. Wait, dienophiles are typically electron-deficient, like something with a triple bond or an electron-withdrawing group.

The cyclohexa-1,3-diene might not be a good dienophile. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is acting as a dienophile in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, and the reaction is a substitution, forming new bonds.

Wait, but the starting norbornene has a bicyclo structure with a double bond. The other molecule has two di-bromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, perhaps the norbornene's diene attacks the dienophile. But wait, the dienophile would need to have a double bond. Wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two double bonds, so maybe it's a conjugated diene, but can it act as a dienophile? Or perhaps the other molecule is strained and acts as a dienophile.

Alternatively, maybe this is a ring-opening reaction. For example, norbornene can undergo ring-opening with dienophiles. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the cyclohexene with the dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is the diene, and the other molecule is a dienophile. So the dienophile would have a double bond, but in this case, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene might not be a good dienophile. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the part that has the leaving groups, like the Br atoms.

Wait, another angle. When you have a diene and a dienophile, the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring. But here, perhaps the dienophile
