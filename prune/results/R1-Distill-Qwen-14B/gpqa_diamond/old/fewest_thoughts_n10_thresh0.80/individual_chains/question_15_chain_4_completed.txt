Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's break it down. So the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected via the radial velocity method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. 

Wait, both have the same mass. Oh, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1. But wait, actually, no. Wait, the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 30 days, Planet_1's is 10 days. So P1 is (1/3) P2? Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. The question says, "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So P1 = (1/3) P2. So Planet_1 has a shorter period.

Both have circular orbits. So their orbits are oriented randomly with respect to our line of sight, I guess. Also, the host stars' masses and radii are given. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2. But both stars have the same radius because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so they have same radii. Interesting.

So the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet compared to the star, and also the alignment of the orbit. But since we're talking about the probability, which is roughly the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front from our point of view.

Wait, the transit probability formula is something like R_p / (R_s * a), where a is the semi-major axis. No, wait, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's (R_p)/(R_s * a). Wait, no, wait. I think the formula for the probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * something. Or maybe another approach.

Wait, more accurately, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² × (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)) 

But for circular orbits (e=0), it simplifies. Alternatively, I might be mixing up terms. Another approach: The probability is actually the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is P = (R_* + R_p) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately (R_* + R_p) ≈ R_*, so P ≈ R_* / a.

Wait, no, that can't be right because in reality, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to be within a certain range of orbital distances for its path to cross our line of sight. So the probability is (R_*)/(a) multiplied by some factor, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The probability that a planet transits its star is given by the formula:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a 

assuming edge-on orbit. So if the semi-major axis is a, then the planet's orbit must lie within a certain distance from our line of sight. The maximum distance for a transit is when the planet's orbit's plane is at a certain angle. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by 2 (since it can be in either direction), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_*/a), because for a randomly oriented orbit, there's a (R_*/a) chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another source I remember says the transit probability is roughly (R_*/a) × (1 / sin i), but that's not right. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_*) / (a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P ≈ (R_*/a) * (1 / (b)), where b is the impact parameter, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_p + R_*) / (a) multiplied by a factor, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the concept of the Hill sphere or something else, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the transit geometry. For a planet to transit, the line of sight must be within the cone defined by the planet's orbital plane. The probability is the ratio of the area where the line of sight would cause a transit, divided by the total possible area for the inclination.

But perhaps a simpler way is to say that the probability is proportional to (R_* + R_p) / a. Since R_p << R_*, we can approximate it as R_* / a.

So the transit probability P is approximately (R_* / a) × (something else), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by (R_p / R_*)? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I think there's a formula that the probability is (R_* + R_p) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5), but for circular orbits, it's (R_* + R_p)/a. Since R_p << R_*, this is roughly R_* / a.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit occurs if the planet's orbit, as viewed from Earth, is such that it crosses the star's disk. The probability is the ratio of the star's disk area to the area of the sphere from which the planet could approach. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should look for another way. Let's think in terms of the semi-major axis and star's size.

Wait, the probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So P = R_* / a. Because for a random inclination, the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is proportional to this ratio. So the higher this value, the higher the probability.

But wait, I think the actual formula is P = (R_*) / a * (something else). Maybe the probability is (R_*) / (a) multiplied by 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_*) / (a) multiplied by 1/(1 - e²)^0.5, but since e is zero, it's just R_*/a.

So assuming P = R_*/a.

Wait, but wait. The star's radius is the same for both planets because the question says both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

So, the probability of transit is proportional to R/(a), but since R is same for both, it's inversely proportional to a.

Because P ∝ 1/a.

So, the planet with a smaller semi-major axis (a) has a higher probability of transiting.

Now, we need to find the semi-major axis for each planet.

Using Kepler's third law, which states that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p) )/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So,

a^3 = [G M_* P² ]/(4 π² )

So, a is proportional to (M_* P² )^(1/3).

Given that, let's compute a for each planet.

Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2 (because M1 is twice M2).

Wait, wait. Wait, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2. So, M1 (star) = 2 M2 (star).

And the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So, P1 = (1/3) P2.

So, for Planet_1:

a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1²) / (4 π² )

Similarly, for Planet_2:

a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2²) / (4 π² )

So, taking the ratio a1/a2:

(a1/a2)^3 = [ (M1 P1²) ] / [ M2 P2² ]

Substituting M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = (1/3) P2.

So,

(a1/a2)^3 = (2 M2 * ( (1/3 P2 )^2 )) / ( M2 * P2^2 )

Simplify:

= (2 * (1/9) P2² ) / (P2² )

= (2/9) 

So, (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9.

Taking cube roots,

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that numerically.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Which means a1 is smaller than a2. So, a1 < a2.

Since the transit probability is proportional to R_*/a, and R_* is same for both, P1 = R_*/a1, P2 = R_*/a2.

So, since a1 is smaller than a2, P1 is larger than P2.

So, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. Therefore, the researchers should observe Planet_1.

Wait, but let me double-check the comparison.

Wait, let me compute the ratio P1/P2.

Since P ∝ 1/a, P1/P2 = a2/a1.

Because P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2.

So, P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We have a1 ≈ 0.606 a2. So a2/a1 ≈ 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So, P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

So, Planet_1 has a probability 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So the researchers would choose Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Looking at options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65x higher.

Option D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7x higher.

So, the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( R_* / a \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( (M_* P^2)^{1/3} \), where \( M_* \) is the star's mass and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \)).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is given by:

\[
\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}.
\]

Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \):

\[
\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \frac{2M_2 \left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2.

The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
