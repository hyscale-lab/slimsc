Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. 

Wait, the question says it's a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. Oh right, the 1S0 notation refers to their state with spin S, orbital angular momentum L, and total angular momentum J. So 1S0 would mean S=0, L=0 (since S is the spin, and 1 is 2S+1, so S=0 means it's singlet state). J is 0 because L is 0, so J=0.

They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So the emitted particle's parity is -1. Now, Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, isn't that the Pauli exclusion principle? Or maybe some symmetry condition?

The final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin is zero. The question is about which partial wave is not permitted based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The options are A to D, each involving a transition where the initial state is 1S0 and the final state is something else, plus another particle. The options are about the angular momentum state of X, denoted by the lowercase letter like 'p' which is l=1 (since p is l=1), 's' is l=0, etc.

So, the process is NN â†’ NN' + X. Since X is emitted, we have to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

I think the steps are: 
1. Apply conservation of angular momentum, which is vector in nature, but since the options give possible l values, perhaps we're considering the parity as well. 
2. Use the fact that the parity of the system must be conserved, considering the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle.

Wait, the parity of the initial state is given by the product of the intrinsic parity of each nucleon and the orbital angular momentum part. But since the NN system is in a state with L=0 (from 1S0), their orbital parity is (-1)^L = 1. Each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1, so the total initial parity is (+1)(+1)(1)
