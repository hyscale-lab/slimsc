Okay, so I've got this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν].

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless, and when you integrate over four dimensions, each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension [mass]^4.

So, I need to find the mass dimension of each part of the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Let me start by recalling the mass dimensions of the fields. Fermions like ψ usually have a mass dimension of 3/2 because the Dirac equation has derivatives (which are mass dimension 1), and the equation is something like (iγ∂ - m)ψ = 0. The ψ term would then need to match the mass dimension of the other terms. So for a Dirac spinor ψ, [ψ]_M = 3/2. Since ψ̄ is the adjoint, it should have the same dimension as ψ.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (as far as I remember, because they're part of the Dirac algebra and don't carry mass dimensions). The expression (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν] doesn't add any mass dimensions because gamma matrices are just constants in terms of mass scaling. So σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or another gauge field. The field strength tensor is typically defined as ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + some terms with the gauge field itself if it's non-abelian. Since Aμ has a mass dimension of 1 (because the kinetic term is (∂μ Aν)^2, so each A has [A]_M = 1), then the derivatives ∂ have dimension 1. So F^{μν} has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. Alternatively, I think F is a tensor, so each derivative contributes, so yeah, F has dimension 2.

Putting this together, let's look at each part of the term:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, σ_{μν} is 0, ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F would have dimension (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2. Let me add that up: 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the term without κ has mass dimension 5.

But the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, so κ must have a dimension that brings the whole term down to 4. So [κ] + 5 = 4. Solving for κ, [κ] = 4 - 5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would correspond to option A or C.

Now, about renormalizability. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions or zero. Because negative mass dimensions imply that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (nonrenormalizable). Wait, no, I think the rule is that renormalizable terms must have couplings with mass dimension ≥ 0. If a coupling has a negative dimension, that term is nonrenormalizable because higher-order terms (like loops) would introduce more divergences that can't be absorbed by the existing terms.

So in this case, κ has [κ] = -1. Since that's negative, the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. So the theory isn't renormalizable, which would point to option C or D.

Looking back at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable. Option D says [κ]=1 and not renormalizable. So since our calculation found [κ]=-1, the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the dimensions. Let me make sure I didn't mess up any steps.

ψ̄ has 3/2, ψ has 3/2, F has 2. So (ψ̄ σ ψ F) is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2. 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the term without κ is dimension 5. The Lagrangian
