Okay, I have this physics problem here about black holes. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So, the question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given data includes the distance to the galaxy and the angular size of the event horizon.

Wait, the event horizon's angular size is θ, and the distance is d=1e10 parsecs. I remember that the angular size relates to the actual size of the object. Oh right, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (size)/(distance), but I should probably think about that in radians because θ is given in degrees.

So, first, let me convert θ from degrees to radians. I know that 1 degree is π/180 radians. θ is 1e-17 degrees. So in radians, that's 1e-17 * π/180. Let me compute that. 

Wait, π is approximately 3.14, so 3.14/180 is about 0.01745. So 1e-17 degrees is approximately 1e-17 * 0.01745 radians. Let me calculate that: 1e-17 * 0.01745 is about 1.745e-19 radians. Okay, so θ ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ r/d, where r is the radius of the event horizon (which for a black hole is the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2GM/c²), and d is the distance. So, r = θ * d. But wait, d is in parsecs, and I probably need to convert that into meters because the radius R_s is in meters when using SI units.

I know that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d=1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 meters. Let me compute that: 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters. So d ≈ 3.086e26 m.

Now, compute r = θ * d. θ is 1.745e
