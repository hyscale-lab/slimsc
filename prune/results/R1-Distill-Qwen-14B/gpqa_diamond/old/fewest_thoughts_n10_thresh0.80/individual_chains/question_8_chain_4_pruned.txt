Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the setup is that they did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). They know at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. Then they tested these mutants against the pathogen and got resistance levels.

The data is:
- g1: 75% (so resistance is 75% of control, which is 100%)
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, but wait. The question says that the resistance is relative to the control. So if control is 100%, then g1 is 75%, which is less than control. So g1 mutant has lower resistance. g2 is 0%, which is very bad, no resistance. g3 is 50%, so half as resistant.

The double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either g1 or g3 alone. g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. g1g2 is 0%, same as g2 alone.

Hmm. So what do these results tell us about the gene interactions?

I remember that in genetics, when looking at epistasis, the position of the genes in a pathway matters. If a gene is epistatic to another, it's downstream. So if a mutation in an upstream gene (like a transcription factor) leads to a higher level of susceptibility, then the downstream genes are epistatic.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. Let's say Gene A is upstream of Gene B. So A activates B. If A is knocked out (a), then B can't be expressed either. So in a double mutant a and b, the phenotype would be the same as a if B is downstream. Or wait, no. If A is upstream, then knocking out A prevents B from being expressed. So if a single mutant a has a certain phenotype, and the double mutant a b has the same as a, then B is downstream of A.

Epistasis is about which gene is in which position. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then A is downstream of B because the phenotype of A masks the effect of B's mutation.

Wait, sometimes it's confusing. Let me think of an example. Suppose in a pathway:

Signal -> Gene B product -> Gene A product -> resistance.

In this case, Gene B is upstream of Gene A. So if you have a mutation in Gene B (b), then Gene A's product isn't made, so you get a phenotype of low resistance. Similarly, a mutation in Gene A (a) would also lead to low resistance because its product isn't there.

Now, if you have a double mutant (b a), the resistance would be same as either single mutant, since both are non-functional. But if the pathway is such that Gene B is a transcription factor activating Gene A, then knocking out B would cause A not to be expressed. So the single mutant b would have the same phenotype as the double mutant a. So the presence of mutation in B masks the effect of mutation in A.

Wait, I think another way to see it is looking at the double mutants. For example, if a double mutant g1g2 has resistance 0%, which is the same as g2's resistance. So the presence of g2 mutation masks the effect of g1.

Similarly, the same for g1g2 and g2g3. Both have 0% resistance. So that suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is mutated, the effect of G1 or G3 mutation doesn't matter anymore; the resistance is as bad as G2's single mutant.

So if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of the other genes, then knocking it out would disable all downstream genes (including G1 and G3). So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So in double mutants with G2, the resistance is as bad as G2's own, which is 0%.

Looking at the double mutants:
g1g2: 0%, same as g2. So g2 is epistatic to g1.
g2g3: 0%, same as g2. So g2 is epistatic to g3.
g1g3: 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than each single mutant. So maybe their functions add up. But what does that mean?

Wait, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either of their single mutants. So perhaps in wild type, G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway. If you knock out each alone, you get some reduction in resistance, but when both are knocked out, the effect is additive or more than either alone. But if they were in the same pathway, perhaps the double mutant would have the same as the more severe single mutant. But in this case, g1g3 is worse than either, which suggests that their functions are additive. So like they might be in parallel pathways, or their products contribute in a way that knocking both out is worse than either alone.

But the question is about the interaction of the genes. Also, one of them is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 is probably the transcription factor because its knockout leads to 0% resistance, which is the most severe. So G2 is likely the transcription factor.

So G2 is a transcription factor, and it's upstream of G1 and G3. So G1 and G3 are downstream. So, when G2 is knocked out, all downstream genes (G1, G3) aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

In the case of the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So maybe G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance. So when both are missing, you lose both contributions, leading to much lower resistance. Alternatively, maybe they are redundant, but that's a different concept.

Wait, redundancy would mean that either gene can compensate for the other. So if you have a single mutant, you lose one part, but the other can take over, so the phenotype isn't too bad. But in this case, when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single mutant, which supports the idea that they're not redundant. Instead, they might be additive.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway. But if G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then knocking out either G1 or G3 would reduce resistance, but knocking out both would not make it worse than the more severe single mutant. However
