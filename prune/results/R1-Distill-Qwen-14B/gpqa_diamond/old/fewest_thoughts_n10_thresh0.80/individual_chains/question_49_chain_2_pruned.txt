Okay, I'm trying to solve this pericyclic reactions question. Let me think through each part step by step. 

The question has three reactions, A, B, and C, each with different starting materials and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them to the options.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Hmm, both are alcohols but with different structures. I recall that in acid conditions, especially with heat, some kind of rearrangement might happen, like a Claisen or Cope rearrangement. Wait, but those are typically for 1,5-dienes or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement? No, that's for 1,2-diols. Alternatively, could it be a Mannich reaction? Not sure.

Wait, wait. The starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine. So that's (CH3O)2CHNH2? And but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOH. So under acidic conditions and heat, maybe they form some kind of hemiacetal or undergo a rearrangement.

Another thought: maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves a vinyl ether rearranging. Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... Oh, maybe it forms an enamine. Enamines can undergo various reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, but the product A is given in the options as either a dihydropyran amine or something else. Let me look at the options. Option A for product A is 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine. That looks like a cyclic amine with a ring, maybe a six-membered ring. How would that form from those starting materials?

Another angle: acid catalyzed conditions can lead to hemiacetal formation. So if we have two carbonyl groups reacting, but in this case, the starting materials aren't carbonyls. Alternatively, could the dimethoxy group form a leaving group?

Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol has a hydroxyl group adjacent to a double bond. So maybe it's a conjugate acid situation. Alternatively, maybe the two reactants undergo some kind of condensation. 

Wait, another thought: The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Under acidic conditions, maybe this can form an enol. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the amine acts as a base, but in H+ conditions, it's protonated.

Hmm, maybe it's a Cope rearrangement. The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. Does that apply here? Wait, but the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine, which doesn't seem to be a 1,5-diene.
