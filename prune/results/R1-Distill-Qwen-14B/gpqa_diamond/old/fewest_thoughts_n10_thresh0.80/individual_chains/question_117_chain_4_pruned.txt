Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when compounds are chiral, meaning they lack a plane of symmetry and have non-superimposable mirror images. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds can exhibit this.

Let's look at the four compounds one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different isomerism. The substituents are at the 6 and 2 positions on each ring. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but do they have stereoisomerism? Oh wait, if the substituents are in positions that allow for a plane of symmetry, they might not be chiral. But in this case, the substituents are at 6 and 2, and the two rings are connected in such a way that maybe there's a possibility of being chiral. Wait, but actually, biphenyls can have something called diastereomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Wait, but this compound has two nitro groups on each ring? Or dimethyl groups on the same ring? Wait, the name says 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro at position 6. Similarly, 2,2'-dicarboxylate, so each has a carboxylate at 2. So the structure is biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Are these positions leading to the molecule being chiral? Let me think. If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, but when the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions on each ring, does that create a situation where the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image? Or perhaps the biphenyl linkage itself allows for some stereoisomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry, making the compound chiral. So perhaps compound 1 can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down.
