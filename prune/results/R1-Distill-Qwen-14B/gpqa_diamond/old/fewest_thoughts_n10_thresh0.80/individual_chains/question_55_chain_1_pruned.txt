Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates, both cis and trans.

First, let me recap the 1H NMR data given:

1H NMR (ppm):
- 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 (1H, dq)
- 2.1 (3H, s)
- 1.6 (3H, d)

So, I remember that in NMR, each peak corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. The splitting patterns and coupling constants give clues about the structure.

Looking at the options, they're all acetates, so the structure is likely an ester. The general structure for such compounds would be something like CH2CH2COO-R, but I need to figure out the exact structure.

The substituents in these compounds are either propenyl or butenyl groups attached to the acetate. The 'cis' and 'trans' refer to the configuration around the double bond. So, the crucial part is to determine the structure of the R group attached to the acetate.

Let me think about the possible structures.

For propenyl acetate, the R group is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2... wait, no. Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-. So, propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but acetate is the ester, so it's CH3COO-R. So if R is propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Propenyl could be either CH2=CHCH2- (propenyl, which can be cis or trans?), but wait, for propene, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so propenyl would have two carbons. Wait, I'm
