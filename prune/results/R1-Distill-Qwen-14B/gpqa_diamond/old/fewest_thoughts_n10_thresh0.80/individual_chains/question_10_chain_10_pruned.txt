Alright, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of these.

Okay, let's break down each option.

Starting with option a: It's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. I remember Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So if this planet has the same mass and radius, its density should be the same as Earth's, right?

Option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given here. So that's straightforward. Its density is 5.5, same as Earth. So that's the same as option a. But wait, if it's more massive but same density, then its radius would be larger. Because density is mass divided by volume, and volume scales with radius cubed. But since density is same, mass goes up with volume, which is radius cubed times density. So, a planet twice Earth's mass but same density would have a radius larger than Earth. But the question here is about the density, not the radius. So option b's density is 5.5, same as a and c.

Wait, but what about option c? It says the planet has the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Hmm, composition affects density. If it's the same composition, then the density should be same as Earth's. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet's density would be the same. Wait, but wait—wait a second, if the mass is five times Earth's, but radius? Because density is mass/volume. If the composition is same, the density is same. So if it's same density, then a planet five times Earth's mass would have a radius larger than Earth. But again, the density here is same as Earth. So option c's density is 5.5, same as a and b.

Wait, but wait. What about option d? It has the same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same composition implies same density. So its density is 5.5 as well. Wait, so all of a, b, c,
