Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles, like how a magnet has both north and south ends. And this is because of one of Maxwell's equations. Oh wait, yeah! The divergence of the magnetic field is zero, meaning there are no isolated magnetic poles. That's the one that makes monopoles impossible.

So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that must mean that Maxwell's equations aren't the same as ours. Which equation would change? Well, the divergence of B is zero in our case because there are no monopoles. The equation is ∇·B = 0. If monopoles exist, then this equation must change. Because monopoles would act like sources or sinks for the magnetic field, similar to how charges are sources for the electric field.

Wait, but the question is asking which of Maxwell's equations are different. Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me list them:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère-Maxwell Law: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

So, if monopoles exist, Gauss's Law for magnetism would no longer be zero. Instead, ∇·B would equal some term related to the magnetic charge density. So equation two would change.

But the question is about which equations are different in that universe. The other equations—Faraday's and Ampère's—would they change? Well, in our universe, Faraday's law relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B, and Ampère's law relates the curl of B to currents and the time derivative of E. Since magnetic monopoles would have magnetic current densities (like a current made of moving monopoles), Faraday's law might not change because it's about B changing over time. Wait, no—if there are magnetic charges, the Maxwell equations would have to account for them in other places too.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In our universe, the two key equations that change when magnetic monopoles exist are Gauss's Law for magnetism and
