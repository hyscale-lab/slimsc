Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. I remember that parity is a quantum number, and when particles are emitted, the overall parity has to be conserved.

Pauli statistics are involved here, which probably relates to the isospin and other quantum numbers. Wait, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh, right, because for identical particles, their wavefunction has to be symmetric or antisymmetric based on their spin, which is part of Pauli's exclusion principle.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to figure out the possible partial waves not permitted based on angular momentum and parity conservation.

The problem gives four options, each showing a transition from the initial 1S0 state to a new state plus a particle. The options are labeled A to D.

Let me think about the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J). Wait, the given example is 1S0, so S is 0 because 2*0 +1 =1. So S=0. L is S, but wait no, the term is 1S0, so L is S? No, wait, the term is written as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0: (2S+1)=1 → S=0. L is denoted by the letter S, which I think corresponds to L=0 because S is the orbital angular momentum letter. Wait, the spectroscopic notation: S is L=0, P is L=1, D is L=2, F is L=3, etc. So 1S0 has S=0, L=0, J=0.

So initial state: T=0? Wait, no, the system is in a 1S0 state, which is for the NN system. The initial state's isospin isn't given. But the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1.

The problem states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I think T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. But wait, the question says the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, the final NN state has T=0. So T = S + L +1 (mod 2) → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. One even, one odd? Because their sum is 1 mod 2.

So for the final state, S + L must be odd.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X. So the initial state is (NN) in 1S0, and then after emission, the NN system transitions to another state. Let's denote the emitted particle as X.

So the process is: initial state (NN) in 1S0 → (NN) in some state + X.

I need to consider conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Wait, but since the system is emitting a particle, the initial state must have the same angular momentum and parity as the final state plus the emitted particle. Wait, no, because the initial state is the NN system. So the NN system before emission is in some state, and after emission, the NN system is in another state, and a particle X is emitted.

Wait, the initial state is the NN in 1S0. Then, the final state is NN in some state, plus X. So the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved.

But wait, the initial state is just the NN system in 1S0. So initial L is 0 (since 1S0), initial spin S is 0 (since 1S0 is S=0), and J is 0 (since J = L + S, all zero).

When the particle X is emitted, the NN system transitions to a state with certain L, S, and J. Plus the particle X has its own orbital angular momentum and spin. But since X is a boson or fermion, but I'm more concerned with the parity here.

So for parity conservation: the initial parity multiplied by the parity of X should equal the final parity.

The initial state's parity is given by the product of the intrinsic parity of the nucleons and their orbital angular momentum. Wait, what's the parity of the NN system?

Wait, the parity of a two-nucleon system is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. Because each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1 (since they're fermions with half-integer spin, but wait, I'm a bit confused about that. Wait, the intrinsic parity of a nucleon is +1, right? Because for fermions like electrons, their intrinsic parity is considered positive in certain conventions, but in some definitions, it's negative. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let's think again. The parity of the NN system is (-1)^L because each nucleon has parity +1, and the orbital part contributes (-1)^L. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1 (since L=0 in 1S0).

When the system emits a particle X, the parity of the process should be conserved. So the initial parity (P_initial) is +1. The final state consists of the NN system in a new state and the emitted particle X.

The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X, but considering their orbital angular momentum as well. Wait, no, the emitted particle X's intrinsic parity is given as -1. The orbital angular momentum part for X (denoted by lowercase letters, like s, p, d, etc.) contributes to the parity.

Wait, but the parity of the entire process must be conserved. So parity_initial = parity_final.

Parity_initial is that of the initial NN state, which is (parity of nucleons)^2 * (-1)^L_initial. Since each nucleon has parity +1, (1*1)=1. L_initial is 0, so parity_initial = 1.

Parity_final is the product of the parity of the NN system after emission and the parity of X in its emitted state.

The parity of X is intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X.

So parity_final = [parity(NN_final)] * [parity_X * (-1)^l_X]

But parity(NN_final) is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the end.

So putting it all together:

1 = [ (-1)^{L_final} ] * [ (-1)^1 * (-1)^{l_X} ]

Because X has intrinsic parity -1, so that's (-1)^1. And the orbital part is (-1)^{l_X}.

So,

1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)^1 * (-1)^{l_X}

Simplify the right-hand side:

= (-1)^{L_final + 1 + l_X}

So,

1 = (-1)^{L_final + l_X + 1}

Which implies that the exponent must be even because (-1)^{even} is 1.

So,

L_final + l_X + 1 = even → L_final + l_X must be odd.

Because 1 is added, so L + l must be odd.

So equation (1): L_final + l_X = odd.

Additionally, from the Pauli condition, T = S + L +1 (mod 2). The final T is 0.

So,

0 = S_final + L_final + 1 mod 2 → S_final + L_final = 1 mod 2 → they must be of opposite parity.

So, S_final and L_final have opposite parities.

Now, considering the options given, each option describes a transition from 1S0 to a new state, and the emitted particle's orbital state.

Let me look at each option:

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

Wait, the notation is a bit unclear. The first part is the initial state, the second is the final NN state and the emitted particle.

Wait, no, the options say:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

Hmm, 7D1 would be (2S+1) L J. So 7D1: 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D which is l=2. J=1.

So after emission, the NN system is in 7D1 state (S=3, L=2, J=1). The emitted particle is a proton (p), which here is a notation for the orbital state? Or perhaps the letter denotes the orbital angular momentum. Wait, the note says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X". So in option A, X is a p state. So p is l=1.

So X has l=1.

So for option A, X has l_X =1.

Now, let's calculate:

From parity equation (1): L_final + l_X must be odd.

In option A:

L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN final state. The final state is 7D1, which has L=2 → L_final=2.

l_X is 1.

So 2 +1 =3 → which is odd. So condition (1) is satisfied.

Now, the Pauli condition: S_final + L_final must be odd.

S_final is the spin of the NN final state. 7D1 has S=3 (since 2S+1=7 → S=3).

L_final from 7D1 is 2.

So S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). Their sum is 3+2=5 → odd. So condition (2) is satisfied.

So option A is allowed.

Option B: 1S0 →3S1 + p.

So the final NN state is 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S, which is L=0 (since the term is S). J=1.

X is p → l_X=1.

Parity condition (1): L_final + l_X =0 +1=1 → odd. Condition satisfied.

Pauli condition: S_final + L_final =1 +0=1 → odd. So condition satisfied.

So option B is allowed.

Option C:1S0 →3D3 + f.

Final NN state is 3D3: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D → L=2. J=3.

X is f→ l_X=3.

Parity condition: L_final (2) + l_X (3) =5 → odd. Condition satisfied.

Pauli condition: S=1, L=2. 1+2=3 → odd. Condition satisfied.

So option C is allowed.

Option D:1S0 →3P0 + s.

Final state:3P0. (2S+1)=3→ S=1. L=P→ L=1. J=0.

X is s→ l_X=0.

Parity condition: L_final + l_X=1 +0=1 → odd. Condition satisfied.

Pauli condition: S=1, L=1. Sum is 2 → even. Which would violate the condition because it must be 1 mod 2.

Wait, because the condition is S + L =1 mod 2. In this case, S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd). 1+1=2 → even. So 0 mod 2. Which doesn't equal 1. So Pauli condition is not satisfied.

Wait, wait, but earlier we derived that S + L must be odd because 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2.

In option D, S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → 0 mod 2. So 0≠1 → condition not met. So this would violate the Pauli condition.

So option D is not permitted.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in interpreting the states?

Wait, in option D: the final state is 3P0. So (2S+1)=3→ S=1. L is P → L=1. So S=1, L=1.

So S + L =2 → even. But according to the condition, it must be odd. So this is not allowed.

So option D is not permitted.

Wait, but wait another thing. What about the angular momentum conservation? Because the initial state has J=0 (since it's 1S0, J=0). The final NN state has J=0, and the emitted X has some angular momentum. So the total angular momentum must be conserved.

Wait, but the problem says that it's about partial waves, so perhaps the process is considering the orbital angular momentum between the NN system and the emitted particle X.

So the initial state has J=0. The final state is the NN system in some J_final, and the X has its own orbital angular momentum state.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's the angular momentum of the NN system that's denoted. So the process must conserve angular momentum, so the total J of the final state (NN system's J plus X's orbital angular momentum) should equal the initial J, which is 0.

Wait, but the problem is only considering the allowed partial waves for X. So each option specifies a particular orbital state for X, which contributes to the angular momentum.

Wait, but the problem says to make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity, so probably both factors are important, but perhaps the main point is parity.

But since the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, and the options are about the emitted particle's angular momentum state (l_X), which affects both parity and angular momentum.

So, in option D, the Pauli condition isn't met, but what about the angular momentum?

Wait, let's think about angular momentum conservation. The initial state has J=0. The final state consists of the NN system with J_final and the X with orbital angular momentum l_X. The total J_final (of NN) plus the orbital angular momentum of X must add up to 0.

Wait, but the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, and since X is emitted, it's in a certain state with angular momentum. So the total angular momentum would be the vector sum of J_final (NN) and l_X (X's orbital part). But since we're considering initial J=0, the vector sum must be zero.

Wait, but J_final and l_X must be zero in vector addition. That can only happen if J_final is equal and opposite to l_X, but that's only possible if J_final = l_X and they are in opposite directions. But J_final is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is given in the options.

Wait, but the way the options are presented, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X. Then, the NN system's angular momentum is given by the J in their term symbol. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J, so J is the total angular momentum, which is a combination of L and S.

Wait, but in that case, the NN's J is given. So the total (NN's J) and X's orbital L must sum to the initial J=0. But this is a vector addition, which complicates things. However, the problem is about the allowed partial waves (i.e., the orbital state of X), so perhaps the angular momentum part is considered for the parity and Pauli condition, but the actual conservation is automatically handled via selection rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial orbital angular momentum (L_initial) is being considered, but in this case, L_initial is 0. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission (L_final) plus the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) must equal the initial L, which is 0. But that's in terms of vectors, not quantum numbers. So for conservation, the vector sum must be zero. But that's tricky because it involves directions.

But maybe the question is only concerned with the parity and the Pauli condition, and not the strict angular momentum conservation for each option. Because solving for all conservation laws might complicate things beyond the scope of the question.

But in any case, the main point is that option D violates the Pauli condition, so it's not permitted.

So the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer is option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state. The term symbol 1S0 corresponds to:
   - Total spin \( S = 0 \),
   - Orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \),
   - Total angular momentum \( J = 0 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting a particle \( X \), the NN system transitions to a new state with:
   - Total spin \( S_{\text{final}} \),
   - Orbital angular momentum \( L_{\text{final}} \),
   - Total angular momentum \( J_{\text{final}} \).

3. **Pauli Condition**: The isospin \( T_{\text{final}} \) of the NN system satisfies:
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Since \( T_{\text{final}} = 0 \), this implies:
   \[
   S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} = 1 \, (\text{mod } 2),
   \]
   meaning \( S_{\text{final}} \) and \( L_{\text{final}} \) must have opposite parity (one even, one odd).

4. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the initial state is:
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.
   \]
   The parity of the final state is:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X,
   \]
   where \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \) and \( P_X = (-1)^{l_X} \cdot \text{(intrinsic parity of } X) \). Since \( X \) has intrinsic parity \( -1 \), we have:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \cdot (-1)^{l_X}.
   \]
   Parity conservation requires:
   \[
   1 = (-1)^{L_{\text{final}} + l_X}.
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   L_{\text{final}} + l_X = \text{odd}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \) implies \( S_{\text{final}} = 3 \), \( L_{\text{final}} = 2 \), \( J_{\text{final}} = 1 \).
     - Emitted particle \( X \): \( p \) state implies \( l_X = 1 \).
     - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{final}} + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3 \) (odd), satisfied.
     - Pauli condition: \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} = 3 + 2 = 5 \) (odd), satisfied.
     - Permitted.

   - **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \) implies \( S_{\text{final}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{final}} = 0 \), \( J_{\text{final}} = 1 \).
     - Emitted particle \( X \): \( p \) state implies \( l_X = 1 \).
     - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{final}} + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1 \) (odd), satisfied.
     - Pauli condition: \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (odd), satisfied.
     - Permitted.

   - **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \) implies \( S_{\text{final}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{final}} = 2 \), \( J_{\text{final}} = 3 \).
     - Emitted particle \( X \): \( f \) state implies \( l_X = 3 \).
     - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{final}} + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5 \) (odd), satisfied.
     - Pauli condition: \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} = 1 + 2 = 3 \) (odd), satisfied.
     - Permitted.

   - **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \) implies \( S_{\text{final}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{final}} = 1 \), \( J_{\text{final}} = 0 \).
     - Emitted particle \( X \): \( s \) state implies \( l_X = 0 \).
     - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{final}} + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (odd), satisfied.
     - Pauli condition: \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \) (even), **not satisfied**.
     - Not permitted.

**Conclusion**: Option D violates the Pauli condition and is therefore not permitted.

Answer: D
