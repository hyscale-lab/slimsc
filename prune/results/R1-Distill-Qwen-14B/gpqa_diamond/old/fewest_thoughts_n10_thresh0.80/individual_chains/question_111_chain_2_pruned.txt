Okay, so I need to tackle this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each reaction given the starting materials and conditions. Then, I'll match them to the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester under basic conditions, it's likely an example of a Michael addition or perhaps a conjugate addition. Wait, no, waitâ€”Michael addition typically involves enolates. Oh wait, wait, no, actually, I think this is a type of cycloaddition or maybe a Claisen-type reaction? Alternatively, maybe it's a Michael addition where the enolate attacks an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is the starting ketone. Its structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So, the substituents are on carbons 2 and 6. So, that's 2-ethyl and 6-methyl? Wait, no, wait. The formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the numbering would be such that the ketone is at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group (so 2-ethyl-2-methyl?), and position 6 has a methyl as well. Wait, wait, the molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexanone has a substituent at position 2 (ethyl and methyl) and another at position 6 (methyl). So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1, a substituent (ethyl and methyl) at position 2, and a methyl at position 6.

Now, when such a ketone reacts with ethyl ac
