Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is bigger or smaller. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. Also, m is small, but I'm not sure how that plays in yet. The lambda given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is the wavelength for the Balmer series in hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line. That transition corresponds to the energy difference between the n=3 and n=2 levels, I think.

So, first, I should probably calculate the transition energy ΔE. I know the formula for the energy levels of hydrogen is E_n = -13.6 eV / n². Wait, but wait, the Rydberg constant is about 13.6 eV, right? So for n=2, E is -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV, and for n=3, it's -13.6 /9 ≈ -1.51 eV. The transition ΔE would be E_2 - E_3, which is (-3.4) - (-1.51) = -1.89 eV. Oh wait, but energy differences are positive, so ΔE is 1.89 eV? Wait, no, actually the energy of the photon emitted is the difference. So when an electron transitions from n=3 to n=2, it emits a photon with energy 1.89 eV.

But wait, wait, maybe I should double-check. The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), right? But I'm not sure if that's necessary here. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm. Let me calculate the energy using E = hc/λ.

H is Planck's constant, c speed of light. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = let's calculate that. Hmm, 6.626e-34 *3e8 is 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.088e-19 J. To convert to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4.088e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, but that doesn't match what I got earlier when using the E_n formula. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in energy levels. Oh wait! I think I messed up the Rydberg calculation. Because when n=3 transitions to n=2, the photon emitted has energy E = E_2 - E_3. Since E_3 is more negative than E_2, the energy is E_2 - E_3 = (-13.6/4) - (-13.6/9) = (-3.4) + 1.511 ≈ -1.889 eV. But since energy emitted is positive, ΔE is 1.889 eV. But wait, the calculation using hc/λ gave me about 2.55 eV. That's a discrepancy. Hmm. Maybe I need to check the exact wavelength for the transition.

Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is the wavelength for the Balmer-alpha line, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2? Or n=3 to n=2? Let me think. The Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So the first line (alpha) is n=3 to n=2, which is about 656 nm. Hmm, wait, no, that's the H-alpha line. Wait, maybe I got the numbers wrong. Let me check: the wavelength for the transition from n=3 to n=2 is about 656 nm (0.656 micrometers), and from n=4 to n=2 is about 486 nm (0.486 micrometers). Oh, right, so the given λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which corresponds to the transition from n=4 to n=2. So ΔE would be E_2 - E_4.

E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. E_4 is -13.6 /16 = -0.85 eV. So E_2 - E_4 is (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. So energy is 2.55 eV. That matches the calculation from hc/λ. So ΔE is 2.55 eV.

Okay, so that's the transition energy. Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this. Paramagnetic coupling... I think in the context of atomic physics, this refers to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian term for this is probably something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ is given by μ
