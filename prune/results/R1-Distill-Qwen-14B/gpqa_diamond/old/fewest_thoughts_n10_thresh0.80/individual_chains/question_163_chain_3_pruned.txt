Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, I remember from my studies that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so it should react with an acid.

The problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we're dissolving it in 100 cm³ of solution. The acid is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it can donate one proton, like HCl or HNO3, right? And strong acids are those that completely dissociate, so their concentration is straightforward.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. Let me calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)). Let's compute that: 55.85 + (3*17) = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

So, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.000936 moles. Let me write that as 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and would react with a strong acid. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so it will react with H+ ions from the acid. The balanced equation should be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve.

So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole provides one mole of H+. So, the volume of 0.1 M acid needed is moles / concentration. Volume = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. But wait, the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. Hmm, but wait, the problem says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid" needed. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the excess of acid. Because in reality, you might need more acid to ensure complete dissolution. But the question says minimum, so maybe the calculation is correct as is. So, 28.08 cm³ is approximately 28.05, which is option C. But let me make sure.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. 0.1 grams / 106.85 g/mol is approximately 0.0009359 moles. So 3 times that is 0.0028078 moles of H+. Then, 0.0028078 / 0.1 M = 0.028078 L = 28.078 cm³. So yeah, 28.08 which matches option C's 28.05. Hmm, perhaps I have a miscalculation because of more precise molar masses or reaction stoichiometry.

Wait, maybe the reaction is different. What's Fe(OH)3's structure? It's Fe^3+ with three OH- groups. So when it reacts with H+, each OH- needs a H+ to become H2O. So each Fe(OH)3 would take 3 H+ ions. Yes, so the stoichiometry is correct.

Now, for the pH part. After dissolving Fe(OH)3, we have a solution of Fe^3+ ions in water. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water to form H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So the pH depends on the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis.

First, let's compute the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 liters. The moles of Fe^3+ are the same as Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 mo
