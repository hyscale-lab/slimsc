Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out which two compounds are present based on the NMR data.

First, let's think about the aromatic region. The two singlets around 6.7 ppm probably indicate two different types of aromatic protons, each as a singlet. Wait, but in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally to the signals. So each of the two aromatic environments must have the same number of protons in each compound.

Wait, but wait. If both compounds have equivalent protons in their aromatic rings, then maybe the NMR would show a single signal. But here it's two signals, so each compound must have a different set of aromatic protons that aren't equivalent.

Wait, but since the mixture is 1:1, each compound contributes equally. So each compound must produce a singlet each. So each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, but for both compounds, the aromatic protons are split into two different singlets.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if a compound has multiple equivalent aromatic protons, they would show as a singlet. But if a compound has two different sets of aromatic protons, each would give a separate signal.

Wait, but the problem states that there are two signals, each a singlet, in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet corresponds to a different compound's aromatic protons. Or maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let's imagine each compound has either two equivalent aromatic protons or more. But considering that both compounds are tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene, let's look at their structures.

Wait, all the options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which is 1,4-diethylbenzene. So, the mixture includes either two tetramethylbenzenes or one tetramethyl and one diethyl.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's check each compound.

Tetramethylbenzenes: each has four methyl groups attached to a benzene ring. So the molecular formula is C8H10. Wait, no, wait: Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3. So four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) = C4H12. So the total would be C6+4= C10, and H: 6 - 6 (because each substitution replaces an H) + 12 = 6 -6 is 0? Wait, no, benzene has six H. Each substitution replaces one H. So four substitutions would replace four H, leaving 2 H. Then, the four methyl groups contribute 3*4=12 H. So total H would be 2+12=14. So molecular formula is C10H14, which matches the problem statement.

So all the options except option C are C10H14. What about option C: 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyl groups would be C4H10. Benzene is C6H6. So total would be C10H16, right? Because each ethyl is -C2H5, so two would be C4H10. Benzene without substituents has six H, but with two substituents, each ethyl group is attached, so two H's lost. So H count would be 6 - 2 (for substitution) + (5*2) = 6 -2 +10 =14? Wait, wait.

Wait, each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl has 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since the one attached to the benzene is the first CH2). So two ethyl groups would add 2*(5) =10 H. Benzene has 6 H, but each substitution removes one H, so 6-2=4 H left on the ring. So total H is 4 +10=14. So molecular formula is C8 (benzene) + 4 (from two ethyl groups) = C10, and H is 14. So option C is also C10H14. So all the options are possible.

Okay, so now looking at the NMR data: two singlets around 6.7 ppm. So each singlet corresponds to a set of equivalent aromatic protons. Since the ratio is 1:1, each compound contributes equally to each signal.

Wait, but perhaps each compound has one set of aromatic protons that are equivalent, leading to a singlet. Then, since the mixture is 1:1, each of their signals are at the same integration ratio.

So, for example, if one compound has two equivalent Hs in its aromatic ring, and the other has two equivalent Hs as well, each would produce a singlet in the aromatic region, and together they would give two singlets, each integrating to the same area (1:1 ratio).

But wait, the integration in the aromatic region is a 1:1 ratio. So each aromatic singlet corresponds to one compound's equivalent Hs. So each compound has a certain number of equivalent aromatic protons, and they produce two singlets.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has two types of aromatic protons, but in the case of the problem, each contributes a singlet.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's think about each compound's aromatic protons.

Take 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: That's a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl substitution. Wait, benzene can't have four substituents all adjacent. Wait, no, 1,2,3,4 is a para arrangement? No, wait, substituting at 1,2,3,4 would imply a
