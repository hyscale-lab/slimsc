Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question involves two reactions using mCPBA on different alkenes and then analyzing the products. The chemist does two reactions: one with (E)-oct-4-ene and another with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, and both go to 100% completion.

Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) reverse-phase and a chiral one. The question is about what the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

Hmm, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is a peracid and commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. Since both reactions are done with one equivalent, I think each alkene would form an epoxide.

Wait, but what about the stereochemistry? Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide in a concerted process. For each alkene, whether E or Z, the reaction with mCPBA forms an epoxide. 

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene â†’ epoxide. The starting alkene is trans, so the substituents on either end are opposite. When it forms the epoxide, the configuration of the oxygen atoms depends on the starting alkene's geometry. But wait, I think that the endo rule or the transition state would lead to the formation of the more substituted epoxide if possible, but in this case, both alkenes are symmetrical maybe? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both ends? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 on each end. Wait, no, no: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle? Let me think. Octene is eight carbons. So oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, perhaps I should draw it. No, octene-4 is CH2CH2 on each end of the double bond. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think. The structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write it as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but wait, that would be oct-1-ene. Wait, no. Oh wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, more accurately: The structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2CH2 groups on either end of a double bond. So for (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene, each has the substituents on opposite or same sides of the double bond.

So when each of these reacts with mCPBA, which adds an epoxide group across the double bond.

But wait, the reaction with mCPBA forms an epoxide, which is a three-membered cyclic ether. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, for a trans (E) alkene, when you form the epoxide, the two new oxygen atoms will be on opposite sides. Similarly, for a cis (Z) alkene, the epoxide oxygens will be on the same side.

Wait, no. Wait, mCPBA adds an epoxide group via an electrocyclic mechanism. The peracid attacks the
