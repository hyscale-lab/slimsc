Okay, so I've got this problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined between x=0 and x=L, and the potential is zero inside and infinite outside. Since the particles are spin-1/2, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So each quantum state can hold two particles because of the two possible spin states.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as pi^2 hbar^2/(2mL^2). I think each particle's energy in the nth level is n² times E. So for a single particle, energy is E * n², where n is the principal quantum number.

But wait, since there are four particles, and they are identical fermions, their arrangement has to follow the Pauli exclusion. So the lowest energy state (ground state) will have the particles filling up the lowest available energy levels, considering the spin.

Let me think about how the filling works. In a 1D box, each energy level can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, the first two go into the lowest level (n=1), each with opposite spins. Then the next two go into the next available level, n=2. Wait, but wait, each level can hold two, so for four particles, two go into n=1, and two into n=2. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a 1D box, each energy level for a particle is E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the given base unit. So the first level is E, second is 4E, third is 9E, fourth is 16E, etc. But since each level can hold two fermions (because spin-1/2), the ground state for four particles would be the two lowest levels filled.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, each with opposite spins, and the next two go into n=2, each with opposite spins. So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E =
