Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with the answers being 1, 3, 5, or 0.

Hmm. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a concept that indicates the number of rings or double bonds in a molecule. Each degree can be a ring or a double bond, or a triple bond counting as two. So, the formula for calculating it is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is hydrogens, X is halogens (but in this case, I don't think there are any), and N is nitrogens (which I don't think are present here either).

So first, I need to figure out what the starting material is, and then what the reaction does to it. Then, I'll analyze the product's structure to determine its degree of unsaturation.

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me break that down. The main ring is cyclohexene, which means a six-membered ring with one double bond. Let me draw the structure mentally.

The substituents on the cyclohexene ring are:

- At position 2: a formyl group (CHO)
- At position 5: a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so attached as a substituent)
Wait, no. Wait, in the name 5-vinyl, that would be a substituent at the 5 position as a vinyl group. So the ring has substituents at positions 2 and 5.

So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3. So the ring structure is cyclohexene (so one double bond). Then, at position 2, a formyl group, and at position 5, a vinyl group.

Wait, but the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps? Because the numbering would start such that the double bond gets the lowest possible number. Let me think: cyclohexene would have a double bond, and the substituents (formyl, vinyl, and the carboxylic acid) are attached at positions 2, 5, etc.

Wait, perhaps the numbering goes so that the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the double bond is between 3 and 4 (since it's 3-en). So the ring is numbered 1 (COOH), then 2 (CHO), then 3 and 4 are double-bonded (C=C), 5 (vinyl group), and 6 would be another position.

So the structure would be:

- Position 1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
- Position 2: CHO (form
