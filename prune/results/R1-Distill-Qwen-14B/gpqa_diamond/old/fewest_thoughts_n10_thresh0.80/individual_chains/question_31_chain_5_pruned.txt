Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions and molecular symmetry, but I'll give it my best shot. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with toluene being treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to get product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product 3, and the options are A to D.

First, I think I need to figure out what each step does. Let's take them one by one.

Step 1: Toluene with nitric acid and H2SO4. I remember that nitration is a common reaction. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, and nitration typically adds a nitro group. Since nitration is an electrophilic substitution, the methyl group is an activating group, so the nitro group would likely go in the ortho, meta, or para position relative to the methyl. Wait, toluene's methyl is a strong activating group, so the nitration would occur at the para position because that's the most stable. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, right? So structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with a methyl group at one position and a nitro group at the para position.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. Hmm, MnO2 is often used as an oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, maybe it's oxidizing something. Looking at product 1, which is para-nitrotoluene. The methyl group attached to benzene could be oxidized. Wait, oxidation of toluene's methyl group would typically turn it into a carboxylic acid group. So, the methyl (CH3) becomes COOH. So product 2 is para-nitrobenzoic acid. Structure is benzene ring with COOH and NO2 groups in para positions.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, toluene's methyl is CH3. If oxidized, under strong acidic conditions with an oxidizing agent like Mn
