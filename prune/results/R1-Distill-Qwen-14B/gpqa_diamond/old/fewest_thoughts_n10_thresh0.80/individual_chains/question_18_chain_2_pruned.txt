Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the elemental abundances of two stars. Hmm, let me read through the question again.

Alright, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, I'm not sure how mass plays into this yet. Maybe it's a red herring or maybe it's important for another part not directly used here.

The problem gives me some abundance ratios determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. I remember that [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_Sun.

Let me list out the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5? Wait, no, the Sun's Mg/H is given as 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh, no, the problem says:

"12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5" Correct. So nFe/nH is 1e-4.5.

Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12 =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for the Sun, Fe/H is 1e-4.5, Mg/H is 1e-5.

But wait, what do I need to find? The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

Hmm, but how? Let me think about the given abundance ratios.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → So, log10(nFe/nH)_1 - log10(nFe/nH)_Sun =0 → log(nFe
