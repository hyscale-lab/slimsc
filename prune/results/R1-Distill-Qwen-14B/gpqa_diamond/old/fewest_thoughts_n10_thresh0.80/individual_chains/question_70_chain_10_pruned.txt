Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions, and based on those reactions, I have to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups are part of molecular symmetry and point group theory. I remember that point groups are used to classify molecules based on their symmetry. So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what E is.

Let me start by mapping out the reactions given.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. The fact that it's a bright red product makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. But 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe it's a metal that forms an octahedral complex? Oh wait, 8 equivalents? That could be something else. Let me think.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous, so maybe a toxic gas or something like that. Hmm.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is in water, it breaks down into A, and produces two acids. Strong acid and weak acid. F is strong—maybe like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc. G is weak—like acetic acid or something similar. Alternatively, maybe F is HCl and G is H2S or something else. Wait, but when C reacts with water, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H. H is a solvent, which could be something like H2O, maybe ethanol, but more likely something simple. Wait, D and B reacting 1:1. Let's think about possible reactions.

Let me try to figure out what each substance could be. Let's start with reaction 4. If D and B form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, methanol, etc. Suppose B is a gas. Let me think of gases that could react with another gas (D) to form a common solvent.

If D is H2O (a gas?), wait, D is a gas as per reaction 2. So, B and D are gases. Reaction 4 is D + B → H, a solvent. So, for example, if B is Cl2 and D is NH3, their reaction could form NH2Cl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, forming H2O. H2O is a solvent, but it's a liquid under standard conditions. Hmm. Or maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O? No, that doesn't make sense because they're both in gaseous form. Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else, but that might not form a solvent.

Wait, another approach: H is a solvent. Let's think of common solvents formed from reactions of two gases. For example, H2O is a solvent but is a liquid, not a gas. Maybe H is something like HCl, but that's a gas. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like hydrochloric acid, but that's a solution. Hmm. Maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Wait, but D is a gas, so perhaps D is H2O (but H2O is a gas only under high temperature or low pressure). Alternatively, maybe D is NH3, which is a gas, and B is HCl gas. So, NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, D is CO2 and B is H2O? No, that's not right. Let me think again. Maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. H2O is a solvent. But in reaction 4, the ratio is 1:1. So, D + B → H. If it's H2O, the reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So
