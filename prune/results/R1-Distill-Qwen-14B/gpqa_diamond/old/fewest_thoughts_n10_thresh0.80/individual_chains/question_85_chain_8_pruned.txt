Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, but the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that factor is out. That should make things a bit easier.

The star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature Teff is 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and RV methods, and they're in circular orbits. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii, while Planet2 has 5 Earth masses and radius 1.3 Earth radii. 

The question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio, Planet1 to Planet2. So I need to find T1/T2.

I recall the formula for equilibrium temperature. The formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5, where A is albedo. Since A is the same for both, that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So the ratio depends on the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.

Wait, but I don't have the orbital distances (a1 and a2) directly. But the problem gives me some Doppler shift information. Oh right, the RV method gives the mass and the orbital period, but not directly the distance. Alternatively, the transit method gives the planet's radius and the orbital period, but maybe that's not directly helpful either for distance.

Wait, but the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is related to the planet's mass and the distance. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = ( (G * M_star * sin i) / ( (M_planet + M_star)^0.5 * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) )^(1/3) ) ) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) * (P/(2π)) ) )

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I remember another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) )

But since both planets are detected via RV, and the star's mass is given, and the RV data gives the semi-amplitude for each planet. The problem states that for the [OI] line, Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. Wait, but wait: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is the velocity, not the wavelength shift. Oh, right, because the Doppler shift relates to the velocity via the formula delta_lambda/lambda = v/c. 

So each planet's RV semi-amplitude K would be K = (delta_lambda) / (lambda) * c, where delta_lambda is the shift, and lambda is the wavelength.

Wait, the forbidden line [OI] is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å, so K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

But wait, that can't be right because the units don't add up. Wait, no. The Doppler formula is v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). So the velocity K is c * (delta_lambda / lambda). So for each planet, K is proportional to delta_lambda.

So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) ≈ (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300) = wait, but 6300 Å is 630 nm, which is 6300 Angstroms. Let me compute K1 and K2.

But wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of K1 to K2. Since lambda is the same for both (6300 Å), the velocity K is proportional to delta_lambda. So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So K1 = (3/4) K2.

But K is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, which relates to the mass and orbital period. The formula is K = ( (G * M_star )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( ( (M_planet + M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) )

But since both planets are around the same star, M_star is the same for both. Also, the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1-e²)^0.5 =1. And assuming that the inclination i is the same (i.e., same sin i, which for both planets, considering they're in the same system, they might have similar i, but perhaps we can ignore that for now. Alternatively, if we're looking for the ratio, it might cancel out.

So, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet) / ( (M_planet + M_star) )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3)
