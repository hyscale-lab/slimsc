Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving a relative speed and total energy. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I can't just subtract the speeds like I would in classical mechanics. Oh right, I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, wait. The velocity addition formula is for when you have two objects moving relative to each other. But in this case, both are moving in the same direction relative to an external frame, like the Earth, perhaps. Oh, but the question is about their relative speed as seen by one astronaut. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, the problem says "relative speed" without specifying, but I think it's the speed of one relative to the other.

Let me recall the formula for the relative velocity. The formula is u = (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1*u2)/(c²)), where u1 and u2 are the velocities of the two objects in the same reference frame. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, wait. No, wait. If both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed of B from A's frame would be (v_B - v_A) / (1 - v_B v_A / c²). Because in A's frame, A is stationary, and B is moving. So if B is moving slower than A, then the numerator would be positive or negative? Let me plug in the numbers.

So, v_A is 0.6c and v_B is 0.5c. So u = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.142857c. Wait, but relative speed is a magnitude, right? So the speed would be about 0.143c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that part might be correct.

Now, the total energy of the system. I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut and sum them up. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² = 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and relative speed is 0.14c. That matches our calculations. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower than what we got. So option C is looking good.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the rest energy? Oh, but the system's total energy would include both their kinetic and rest energies. Wait, no, the question says "the total energy of the system"—so yes, their rest masses plus kinetic. So my calculation should be correct.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. That's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Did I compute it correctly?

Wait, the problem says the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c. So that's correct.

Yeah, so the correct answer should be option C.
