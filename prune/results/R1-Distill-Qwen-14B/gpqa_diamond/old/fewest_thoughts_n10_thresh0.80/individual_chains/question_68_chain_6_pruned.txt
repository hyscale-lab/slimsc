Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem is about a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then the field is switched off and turned on again along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so the magnetic moment has a z-component, and we're looking at how its average value changes over time. The oscillation frequency is what we need to find.

Hmm. I remember that in such scenarios, the spin precession comes into play. When the magnetic field changes direction, the spin will precess around the new field direction. But since we're looking at the average of the z-component, maybe it's about how that component oscillates as the spin state evolves.

Let me think about the energies involved. The particle's magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field. The energy is given by the dot product of mu and B. So initially, when B is along Z, the energy levels are determined by Sz. The magnetic moment would align with the field (lowest energy) or opposite (higher energy).

But when the field is suddenly changed to Y, the spin state doesn't change instantaneously. So the wavefunction doesn't immediately adjust. The state remains in the eigenstate of Sz, but the energy eigenbasis changes because the magnetic field direction changes.

Wait, right, when you have a spin-1/2 system, the Hamiltonian is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So initially, H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero for an instant, but I think for this problem, it's more about the sudden change from B along Z to B along Y.

Wait no, the problem says the magnetic field is turned off and then another one is turned on along Y. So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, and then the Hamiltonian changes to H_final = -gamma * B * S_y.

Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction energy is -mu · B. So the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B = -gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but I think in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is often written as H = -gamma B S·n, where n is the direction of the field. So in this case, n is along Y. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait, in the initial state, the spin is along Z. So the spin state is either |+z> or |−z>. But after the field is turned on in Y, the spin will precess around Y.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. So the average value of Sz would oscillate.

I think the approach is to find how the expectation value <Sz> evolves over time.

So let me think about the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian.

The initial state is an eigen
