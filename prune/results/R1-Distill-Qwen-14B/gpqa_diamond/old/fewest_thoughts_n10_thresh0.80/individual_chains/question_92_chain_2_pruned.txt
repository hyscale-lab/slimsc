Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I need to find its enthalpy of formation. 

Wait, the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is breaking a solid element into its atoms, so for carbon, that's forming C atoms from solid carbon. Then there are bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. 

I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula is something like taking the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the products (the molecule). Oh wait, no, I think it's the reverse. Because when you form products from elements, you're breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the products. So the enthalpy change (ΔH) is the sum of bond energies broken minus the sum of bond energies formed. 

Wait, actually, the standard formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

Wait no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Oh, right, the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (reactants) into atoms, minus the energy released when the bonds in the compound (products) are formed. So:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of compound)]

But wait, elements are in their standard states. For example, carbon is in solid form, but we're given the enthalpy of atomization as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right! So the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert solid carbon into gaseous atoms. So for each carbon atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol. Because each mole of solid carbon becomes a mole of gaseous atoms.

So, the process is: we first calculate the energy required to atomize all the carbons in the compound and all the hydrogens. Then, subtract the energy from the bond
