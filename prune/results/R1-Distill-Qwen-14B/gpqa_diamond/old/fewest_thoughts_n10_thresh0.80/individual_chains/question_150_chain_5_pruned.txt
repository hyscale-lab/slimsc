Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's an important starting point. The NMR data is given, which should help me figure out the structure of the starting material. Once I know that, I can see how it reacts with the given reagents.

The reagents are in three steps:
1. NaNO2 and HCl
2. H2O
3. Aqueous KOH and heat.

I remember that NaNO2 and HCl are usually involved in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. Diazonium salts are formed under these conditions. Then, when you add water, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But wait, sometimes after diazotization, different reactions can happen depending on the conditions. For example, hydrolysis or maybe coupling reactions.

Looking at the NMR data:

The peaks are at:
- 9.72 ppm, a triplet (t), 1H
- 6.98 ppm, a doublet (d), 2H
- 6.51 ppm, a doublet (d), 2H
- 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet (bs), 2H
- 3.66 ppm, a doublet (d), 2H.

So, let me try to interpret these signals.

First, the triplet at 9.72 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton (CHO), but wait, in aldehydes, the proton is typically around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet. But here it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a para-substituted ring? Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an enol tautomer or something else.

Wait, the coupling: triplet. So each of these protons is coupling with two others. For aromatic protons, maybe a para-substituted ring with two adjacent protons. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde with some coupling. Wait, aldehydes are usually deshielded and don't split much because they're at the end. Unless it's part of an enol structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde, so the aldehyde proton is part of the aromatic ring? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the aldehyde is next to a double bond, so the aldehyde proton is coupling with two adjacent protons. Oh, wait, maybe it's an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde). Like CH2=CHCHO. In such cases, the aldehyde proton could be coupling with the adjacent CH2 group. But wait, in an enal, the aldehyde is at the end of a double bond. Like RCH=CHCHO. Hmm, but that would have the aldehyde proton as a triplet if it's next to a CH2 group. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system where the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the proton at 9.72 is part of a di-substituted aromatic ring, like in a para-substituted benzene where each substituent has protons that couple with it. Wait, but aromatic protons in para-substituted rings are usually doublets or singlets, depending on substitution.

Let me try to break down the other NMR signals. The 6.98 ppm doublet (2H) and 6.51 ppm doublet (2H) suggest a pair of aromatic protons each. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. So, for example, if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, the protons adjacent to it would be deshielded and appear as doublets. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be two sets of two protons each, perhaps in a meta or para arrangement. Wait, but a para substituent would make the two protons adjacent to it as doublets. Wait, like if the substituent is at the para position, the neighboring protons (ortho) would be doublets.

But wait, maybe this is a di-substituted benzene, perhaps with substituents at para positions. Or maybe it's a substituent that's di-ortho or something else.

Looking at the 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Broad singlet usually suggests some exchange, maybe -OH protons, but they're downfield. Wait, but alcohols are usually in the 1-5 ppm range, but if aromatic -OH (e.g., phenol), the protons are around 5-7, but given as a singlet. But wait, the 6.27 is a bit lower than typical phenolic OH, but it's possible if the OH is de-shielded. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some other structure.

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 could be vinyl protons in a conjugated system. For example, CH2 groups adjacent to a double bond. But why a broad singlet? If they are part of an enol tautomer which is exchanging, maybe.

The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or adjacent to a carbonyl. Since it's a doublet, perhaps coupled with another CH2 group or with an adjacent O.

Putting this all together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let me try to imagine a structure.

Let's say we have a benzene ring with some substituents. Maybe the ring has a substituent that is connected to a chain. For example, maybe the structure is a diphenyl compound, since the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5 degrees. So that's 5 degrees: could be five rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds.

Each ring or double bond is one degree. So 5 could be a benzene ring (3 degrees) plus a double bond (1) and a ring (1?), wait no, let me think again. Benzene is 3 (three double bonds, but in reality, it's one ring plus three double bonds, but structure-wise, it's one ring plus three double bonds but that's a total of four degrees for benzene, wait no, wait, each double bond is a degree, each ring is a degree. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring? No, no, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds, each double bond is a degree, and the ring is another. So benzene has 4 degrees? Wait that can't be right because each ring is 1, each double bond is 1. Benzene has three double bonds in the ring, so that's three, plus one ring, so 4 degrees.

Wait, no, each double bond is a separate degree. Benzene has three double bonds as part of the ring, but the ring itself is considered just one degree of unsaturation. So benzene contributes four degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds. Or wait, maybe each double bond is a separate degree. Let me recalculate:

Each ring is one degree. Each double bond is another. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring, so 4 degrees. Then, if our molecule has a benzene ring, that's 4. The remaining degrees of unsaturation would be 1 (since the total is 5). So another double bond or a ring.

Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: the molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring (3 double bonds, 1 ring) which is four degrees, plus a carbonyl group (which is a double bond, adding one), so that's five degrees. So perhaps there's a benzaldehyde group somewhere.

Wait, but let me think of the structure.

Suppose the molecule has a benzene ring, and an aldehyde group attached. Also, perhaps a side chain that has some substituents.

Looking at the NMR, there's a triplet at 9.72, which I'm thinking is the aldehyde proton. But why a triplet? Maybe it's coupled with two adjacent protons, like in a CH2-CHO group. So for example, if the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO. Then the aldehyde proton would be adjacent to the CH2, which has two protons. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet integrating to 1H, and the CH2 would be a quartet. But looking at the NMR data, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet (2H), not a quartet. Hmm, maybe that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's a more complex structure. Let me think: perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl compound with an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. No, that doesn't seem to fit the NMR. Or maybe it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but the triplet at 9.72 would require coupling with two protons, which would be the CH2 next to the aldehyde.

Wait, let me think of the structure as follows: perhaps there's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a -CH2-CHO group. So the substituent is attached to the
