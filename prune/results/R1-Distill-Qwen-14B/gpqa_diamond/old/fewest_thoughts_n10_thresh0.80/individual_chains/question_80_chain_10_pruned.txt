Okay, so I've got this problem about an algorithm that takes DNA sequences as input and gives numerical outputs. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I need to figure out what value the sequence ACAGTGACC would give. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how the algorithm works, but I'll try to find a pattern from the given examples. Let's break it down.

First, let's look at the first example: AGG. The output is 115. AGG has three nucleotides: A, G, G. So maybe each nucleotide contributes a certain value, and the total is the sum. Let me check that.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Because if each nucleotide's value is added, then maybe each has a specific number. Let's see what each letter might represent as a number.

In the first example: AGG is 115. So A is 1, G is 2, and G is 2. Wait, 1 + 2 + 2 =5, but the output is 115. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe each position has a different multiplier.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is assigned a value, and these are summed. Let's see:

AGG: 3 letters. Let's say A is 1, G is 2, G is 2. So 1 + 2 + 2 =5, but the output is 115. So that's way off. Maybe each letter's value is multiplied by its position? Like A is first position, so 1*1, G is second position, 2*2, G is third, 2*3.

Wait, so for AGG, that would be (1*1) + (2*2) + (2*3) = 1 +4 +6=
