Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each of these techniques will give me clues about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be an -OH group. Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is often a carbonyl group (C=O), like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or an amide, but since the options don't have nitrogen, probably something else.

Next, the ¹H NMR spectrum. It shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have a double bond somewhere, probably an alkene group. The presence of these suggests maybe a conjugated system, but not sure yet.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think. The molecular ion could break into smaller parts. For example, a fragment of 45 could be a methyl group attached with something else, but wait, acetate has a molecular weight of 60 (CH3COO- is 59, but with something). Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45. Or maybe a CH2O group? Alternatively, maybe a fragment from an ester. But I'm not entirely sure yet. 

Now, let's look at the possible molecular formulas: the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6
