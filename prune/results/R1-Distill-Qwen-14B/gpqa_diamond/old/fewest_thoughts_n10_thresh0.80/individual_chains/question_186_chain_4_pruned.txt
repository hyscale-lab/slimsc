Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I need to find out what product it forms after undergoing a Cope rearrangement.

Wait, what's a Cope rearrangement again? Oh right, it's a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement in 1,5-dienes. The reaction typically converts a 1,5-diene into another 1,5-diene or sometimes a cyclic compound. The general form is when you have a conjugated diene with a substituent in the 1 and 5 positions, the groups shift positions.

So looking at the starting material, it's a bicyclic compound with a vinyl group attached. Let me draw this structure mentally. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered ring, I think. The numbering... the bridgeheads are at 1 and 4, with substituents there.

The structure is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the azabicyclo part means it's a nitrogen-containing bicyclic compound. The 2-azabicyclo suggests that the nitrogen is at position 2. Wait, the numbering in bicyclo systems can be a bit tricky, but let me think—bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has bridgeheads at positions 1, 4, and another position. Oh wait, no, the bicyclo notation is bicyclo[x.y.z], where x, y, z are the number of carbons in each bridge. So bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane would have bridges of 2, 2, and 1 carbons. So the structure is like norbornane.

So in this compound, the nitrogen is at position 2. The substituents: a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) is attached to the same carbon as the nitrogen, position 2. And there's a double bond at position 5, so the hept-5-ene part.

Wait, the structure is
