Okay, I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because pH calculations can get tricky, especially with multiple acids and bases. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the problem says we have three solutions mixed together. The goal is to find the pH of the resulting solution. The solutions are:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I think is that I should calculate the total moles of each acid and base in the mixture. Because when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, and any excess will determine the pH.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, while HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, I need to consider the neutralization reactions between the acids and the base.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

First solution: 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) of 0.1 M CH3COOH.

Moles = Molarity × Volume
Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

Second solution: 400 mL (0.4 L) of 0.2 M HCl.

Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Third solution: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH⁻. So total moles of OH⁻ = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to figure out what happens when these are mixed. The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL or 1.2 L.

Wait, but before that, let's think about the neutralization. The strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will neutralize each other first. Then, any remaining strong acid will react with the weak acid (probably not, since they're both acids). Or wait, maybe the strong base will also react with the weak acid, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about all the reactions.

Wait, the strong acid (HCl) and the strong base (Ba(OH)2) will react first since they completely dissociate. Let me write the reaction:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But wait, more accurately, each HCl donates H+ and Cl⁻, each Ba(OH)2
