Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, I need to figure out the right approach. Let me break it down.

First, what's a retrovirus? Oh right, retroviruses have RNA as their genetic material, and they make DNA from it using reverse transcriptase. So when designing a test for this, I probably need to target either the RNA or the DNA.

The question is about a diagnostic kit, so it's for detecting the virus in patients. The options are about different methodsâ€”nested PCR, real-time PCR, DNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing, and ELISA for IgG antibodies.

Wait, ELISA for IgG would detect antibodies, not the virus itself. That's more for serological testing, like whether someone has been exposed before. But the question is about quick diagnosis, which I think refers to detecting the actual virus presence, not antibodies. So options D might not be the best choice unless it's for past exposure, but I think the question is about acute infection.

Next, designing a molecular test. For viruses, especially RNA ones like retroviruses, PCR is a common method. But which type? Nested PCR is more sensitive but requires more steps. Real-time PCR (or qPCR) is faster and can quantify the amount, which is good for quick and accurate diagnosis.

Wait, but for a retrovirus, the target would be RNA. But PCR needs DNA. Oh right, so for RNA viruses, you have to do reverse transcription first. So RT-PCR is the method, which is a type of real-time PCR perhaps.

Looking at the
