Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density.

Wait, density is mass divided by volume, right? So I need to compare the densities of each option.

Looking at the options:

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So that's our planet Earth. Its density I know is about 5.5 g/cm続 because Earth is made of rock and metal.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density 5.5 g/cm続. Wait, but the question says the density is 5.5, so that's already given. So if the density is same as Earth, but mass is twice, then the volume must be double. Because density = mass/volume, so if mass doubles and density stays same, volume doubles too.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density, right? Because if it's made of same materials, the density would be similar. So if it's 5x Earth's mass, the volume would be (5)^(1/3) times Earth's radius. But since density is same, its density would still be about 5.5 g/cm続.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So density same as Earth's, 5.5. So that's same as a and c.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The options are a, b, c, d. The answers are A) d, B) a, C) c, D) b.

So the question is which has the highest density. So which of these options has the highest density.

Wait, for option a, it's Earth, 5.5. Option b is given as 5.5 g/cm続. So same as Earth.

Option c is same composition, so same density. So 5.5. Option d same.

Wait, but then why would any of these have a higher density than others?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read again.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So that's Earth's density, 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, and density 5.5. So perhaps the planet is more massive but same density as Earth, but I'm told that the density is 5.5 for
