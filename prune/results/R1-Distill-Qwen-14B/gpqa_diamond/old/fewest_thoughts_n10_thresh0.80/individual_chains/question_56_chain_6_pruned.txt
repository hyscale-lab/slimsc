Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. For dipole transitions, the selection rules are specific. I think the main ones are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the parity has to change, so n must change by an odd number since l flips by 1, which changes parity.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. It needs to decay in two steps to |1,0,0>. So two dipole transitions, meaning each transition must follow the selection rules.

Let's break it down. First, from n=3, l=0, m=0. What possible states can it transition to in the first step?

Since Δl can be ±1, from l=0, the next possible l is 1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. Also, n must change. The energy levels are lower for higher n when l is larger, so from n=3, l=0, the next possible n would be 2 or 1? Wait, but two transitions are needed, so let's see. Going from 3 to 1 in two steps requires each step changing n by 1, perhaps. Because 3→2→1.

So first transition: n=3 → n=2, l=0 → l=1. So the state after first transition would be |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, the initial m is 0. So for the first transition, the change in m can be 0, ±1. So possible m in the first step would be 0, ±1.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0>, so m=0. So the first transition's m can become -1, 0, or +1.

So possible states after first transition: |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.

Now, the second transition must take us from n=2 to n=1. Because after two steps, we get to n=1.

So from |2,1,m>, we need to transition to |1,0,0>.

What are the selection rules again? For dipole transitions, Δl = ±1. So from l=1, the next l can be 0 or 2. But since we're going to |1,0,0>, the next state has l=0. So the second transition must have Δl = -1 (since 1 → 0).

So for the second transition, l must decrease by 1. So that's allowed.

What about n? From n=2 to n=1, which is a change of -1. That's allowed because Δn can be ±1 for dipole transitions.

Now, how about m? The initial m in the second step could be -1, 0, or +1. The final state has m=0. So in the second transition, the change in m can be +1, 0, or -1.

So from m' to 0, the change is Δm = m_final - m_initial.

So for the first transition, m could be -1, 0, +1. Let's consider each possibility.

Option 1: First transition to |2,1,0>.

Then, in the second transition, from l=1, m=0 to l=0, m=0. So Δm must be 0. So that's allowed because m can change by 0, ±1. So yes, that's allowed. So the first step is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>, then |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.

Alternatively, other possibilities.

Option 2: First transition to |2,1,1>.

Then, in the second transition, m would have to go from 1 to 0. So Δm = -1. That's allowed (since Δm can be -1). So the second transition would be |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, which is allowed.

Same for m=-1: transition from m=-1 to m=0 would require Δm=+1, which is allowed.

So the question is, which of these routes is possible, and which has the correct probability.

Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D.

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>,
