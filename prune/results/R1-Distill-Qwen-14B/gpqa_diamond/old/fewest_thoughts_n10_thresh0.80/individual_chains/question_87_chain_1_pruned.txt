Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, so the ring is 6-membered, which is benzene-like. But wait, benzene has 6 carbons. So if the compound has 8 carbons in total, the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. So each substituent has one carbon each, right? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? Wait, no, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So each substituent must be a single carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is one? Wait, let me think. The total is 8; the ring is 6, so substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent could be a methyl group (1 carbon each), or one substituent could be ethyl (2 carbons) and the other nothing? Wait, but it's di-substituted, meaning two substituents, so perhaps each has one carbon. Like two methyl groups? Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, which is O=C-R. Or maybe one substituent is a halogen and another is a carbonyl, but wait, the question says that in the FTIR spectrum, there are peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound must have both a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.) and a carbonyl-containing group. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe one substituent is a -X (halide) and the other is a carbonyl group, which could be, for example, a ketone (like -CO-) but wait, that's not possible because a ketone needs at least two substituents, right? Or perhaps an acyl group. Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring, such as a ketone (
