Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with charges and conductors, image charges come into play, especially in the method of images. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy... Oh right, for a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them. But in this case, it's a bit different because one of the charges is induced on the conducting sphere, which is grounded.

So the conducting sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to the earth, allowing charges to move freely. Since the sphere is a conductor, any charge placed near it will induce a charge distribution on the sphere. But because it's grounded, the sphere's potential is zero, which might affect how the charges are distributed.

I think the method of images applies here. The idea is that the conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge. Because the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero. For a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge is located inside the sphere. Or wait, no, wait. No, because the sphere is grounded, the image charge should be inside the sphere. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me get this straight. The method of images says that to find the potential outside a grounded conducting sphere, you can imagine a charge inside the sphere that's in such a way that the potential due to this image charge and the original charge q satisfies the boundary conditions.

So the original charge q is at a distance d from the center of the sphere. The sphere has radius R. So the distance d is greater than R because the charge is placed outside the sphere.

The image charge for a grounded sphere outside the sphere would be inside the sphere. The image charge q' is located at a point such that the distance from the center is R²/d. Because the product of the distances from the original charge and the image charge to the center is R². So the image charge is at a distance of R²/d from the center towards the charge q.

Wait, that's right. So if the original charge is at distance d, the image charge is at R²/d. Because the product d * (R²/d) = R². So
