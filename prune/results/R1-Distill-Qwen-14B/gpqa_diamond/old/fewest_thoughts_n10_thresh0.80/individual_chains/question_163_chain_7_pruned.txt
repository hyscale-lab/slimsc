Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here that I need to solve. Let me read it carefully again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid, and then determining the minimum volume of the acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, okay.

Alright, let's break it down. The problem states we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve in 100 cm³ of solution. The acid we're using is 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it can donate one proton, like HCl or HNO3. Since it's a strong acid, it will dissociate completely in solution.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The formula mass of Fe(OH)3 is... let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles, approximately 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I believe. So when we add a strong acid to it, the acid will react with the base. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Oh wait, but wait, Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 can accept three protons (H+ ions) to dissolve.

So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions. So, the mole ratio is 1:3.

So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter. Since we need 0.002808 moles, the volume (in liters) is moles / concentration. So, 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, the options don't have exactly 28.08. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is very close. Option B is 30.09, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the molar mass again. Fe is 55.85, each OH- is 17. So 3 OH- groups would be 3*17=51. So 55.85+51= 106.85 g/mol. That's correct. So 0.1 g /106.85 = 0.0009358 mol. So yes, 3 times that is 0.0028074 mol H+ needed.

Volume needed is 0.0028074 /0.1 = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³. Rounding to maybe 28.07, which is close to option C's 28.05. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should consider significant figures. The given data is 0.1 g and 0.1 M. Both have one significant figure, but perhaps considering more precise calculations, maybe it's 28.08, which is 28.08 cm³. But option C is 28.05, which is close, but
