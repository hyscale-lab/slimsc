Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted aromatic compound. Let me start by breaking down the question.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring, right? And the ring is 6-membered, so it's probably benzene with substituents.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like C-Cl or C-Br). So the substituents on the benzene ring must include a carbonyl and a halogen.

But wait, benzene has 6 carbons, and the compound has 8 carbons total. So substituents add 2 more carbons. Let me think: the substituents are probably an acyl group (like -CO-) because that has a carbonyl. Oh wait, if one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and another is a halogen, but wait, that would only add one carbon each. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, wait. Let me count again. Benzene is 6 C. The molecule has 8 C. So substituents add 2 C. So each substituent must be something with one carbon. Like maybe a -CO- group and a -X (halide) substituent. Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons, and the other is zero? No, because di-substituted means two substituents.

Hmm, maybe the substituents are a ketone group (like a carbonyl) and a halide. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, another approach: possible substituents that add up to 2 carbons. So perhaps one substituent is a -CO- group (which is O=C-O-R? No, wait, maybe a -CO-R group. Wait, if it's a ketone, like -COCH3, then that's two carbons (one from CO, another from methyl). But then the other substituent is a halogen, like Cl. So that would make total 6+2+1 = 9? No, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the benzene ring is 6 carbons. The substituents add 2 more carbons. So each substituent is a single carbon group. So substituents could be -CO- and -X, but wait, -CO- is an oxygen but doesn't add a carbon. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group and the other is a carbonyl group. Wait, that would add 1 (methyl) + 1 (CO) = 2 carbons. So benzene plus two substituents: a methyl and a carbonyl group? But where is the carbonyl? Maybe it's an acetophenone structure, where the ring has a ketone substituent, like para-substituted.

Wait, but the IR showed a carbonyl, so that's correct. Also, an aromatic halogen, which would be a substituent like Cl or Br.

Wait, but if the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen, but each substituent is on the ring. So
