Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some strong acids and a strong base. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think. 

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but here we have specific amounts, so I can't just use that directly.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, wait, but wait. When mixing these, I need to find out which acids are reacting with which base. Oh wait, actually, HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the acids will neutralize the base.

Wait, but no, I think it's the other way around. The base will react with the acids. So each mole of H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

So first, I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Wait, right, because HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two H+ ions. But wait, wait, in a solution, the first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be. Wait, no, for concentrated solutions, the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second is also almost complete when dealing with strong acids. So for H2SO4, I think I can consider both H+ ions as fully dissociated, especially in a solution with other strong acids. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So let's calculate the moles for each solution.

HCl: 0.2 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

H2SO4: 0.3 M in 300 mL. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M in 200 mL. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, so the H+ and OH- are reacting in a 1:1 ratio, right? So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

But wait, the amount of H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So the limiting reagent is OH-, because only 0.2 moles can react. The H+ will have 0.08 moles left, but in this scenario, since all the OH- is used up, only 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react.

So the reaction is for 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

The enthalpy change for neutralization is per mole, so I should find the total enthalpy
