Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. The reaction typically occurs under thermal conditions, like heat, and forms a gamma,delta-unsaturated diene from a 1,5-diene.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene... so that's a norbornene structure, right? Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with a bridge. So the structure has two rings, a five-membered and a six-membered? Or maybe two five-membered rings? I think bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridgehead carbons, each connected by bridges of two, two, and one carbons respectively.

So the molecule is 2-vinyl, meaning there's a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to the 2-position of the bicyclo structure. The azabicyclo part means there's a nitrogen in the ring. Oh wait, 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the nitrogen is at position 2. The substituents are at 1S and 4R configurations.

I'm trying to visualize the structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridgeheads, positions 1 and 4. The 2-azabicyclo suggests that the nitrogen is at position 2. So the structure is a bridge with a nitrogen in one of the bridge positions.

For the Cope rearrangement, I need to look for a 1,5-diene system. So in this molecule, where are the double bonds? The molecule has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached at position 2. Then, the bicyclo structure has another double bond at position 5. So the structure has two double bonds: one in the vinyl group and another in the bicyclo ring.

Wait, but the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a double bond at position 5. Let me count the positions. The bicyclo system has seven atoms in total. Positions 1 and 4 are bridgeheads, and the double bond is between 5 and 6 or something like that? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbering.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Alternatively, think about the structure. The bicyclo system is like two fused rings: a five-membered and a six-membered? Or maybe a bridge between positions 1 and 4, and another bridge elsewhere. Hmm.

Assuming the structure has a bridge, the double bonds are at 5 and the vinyl. So, the molecule has two double bonds: one in the bicyclo ring (hept-5-ene) and another as the vinyl group (CH₂=CH- attached at 2). So the 1,5-diene must involve these double bonds.

Wait, but the Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-d
