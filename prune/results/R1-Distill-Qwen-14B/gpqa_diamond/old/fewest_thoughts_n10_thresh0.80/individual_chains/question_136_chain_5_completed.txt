Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a given point. So, the divergence of a radial field might have a specific form. Since the field is radial and depends only on r, maybe there's a formula for divergence in spherical coordinates that applies here.

Wait, I think in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)), where F(r) is the radial component of the field. So in this case, F(r) = 1/r². Let me plug that in.

So F(r) = 1/r². Then,

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Simplify the expression inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, but then the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. Oh wait, but the vector field is 1/r², which is like the electric field of a dipole, perhaps? Or wait, wait, no, maybe that's 1/r³. Wait, no, wait: Coulomb's law is 1/r² for electric fields of point charges, but that's for monopoles. Wait, but in this case, the divergence is zero except at r=0, right?

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. But wait, if the field is defined everywhere except the origin, then in the volume integral over the sphere, which includes the origin, perhaps there's a delta function or something? Or maybe not, because the divergence itself is zero except at the origin.

Wait, but wait, if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the volume integral would be zero, right? Because the divergence is zero in all the points except possibly the origin, which is a single point, and the integral over a point is zero.

But wait, I'm confused because I remember that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ f · dA over the surface.

Let me think about that. If f is 1/r² radial, then on the surface of radius R, the flux would be the integral of f · dA. Since it's radial, f · dA is f * R² sinθ dθ dφ because dA in spherical coordinates is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So f is 1/(R²) at radius R, so the integral becomes (1/R²) * ∫∫ R² sinθ dθ dφ. The R² cancels, leaving ∫∫ sinθ dθ dφ. The integral over θ from 0 to π is 2, and φ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So 2 * 2π =4π. So the surface integral is 4π.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f is equal to the surface integral of f · dA, which is 4π. But earlier, I thought the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So that would mean that the volume integral is equal to the value at the origin times something, perhaps using a delta function.

Ah, right! Because the divergence is zero except at the origin, the volume integral ∫ (∇·f) dV is actually the same as the flux through the surface, which is 4π. But wait, since the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, how does that reconcile? Oh, because in reality, the divergence is a delta function at the origin. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), perhaps?

Wait, let me double-check. For a vector field that's radial and depends only on r, the divergence is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)). So F(r) = 1/r².

So the divergence is (1/r²) * d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ] = (1/r²) * d/dr (1) = 0.

Ah, but that's the divergence away from the origin. At the origin, the field might have a singularity. So perhaps the field is actually similar to the electric field of a point charge, but wait, no, point charge is 1/r², but its divergence is 4π δ(r). Hmm, wait, maybe that's the case here.

Wait, the electric field E(r) of a point charge Q is E = (Q/(4πε₀)) (1/r²) r̂. The divergence of E is (1/(ε₀)) δ³(r). So, ∇·E = (1/ε₀) δ³(r).

In this problem, the vector field f(r) is given as 1/r² in the radial direction. So perhaps f(r) is analogous to E, but without the constants. So, the divergence of f would be something like 4π δ³(r), because in the case of E, ∇·E = (1/ε₀) δ³(r), and if we set 1/ε₀ =4π (because sometimes in Gaussian units, 1/ε₀ =4π), then ∇·E would be 4π δ³(r).

So, for f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, ∇·f = 4π δ³(r).

So, when we integrate ∇·f over the volume of a sphere of radius R that includes the origin, the integral becomes ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π ∫ δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 =4π. Because the integral of the delta function over all space is 1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the field has a magnitude f(r)=1/r², so it's similar to f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So the divergence is 4π δ³(r).

Wait, but earlier I thought that the divergence is zero except at the origin. So the volume integral would be 4π, because the divergence has a delta function at the origin.

So the volume integral ∫ (∇·f) dV over the sphere of radius R would be 4π, as the delta function contributes 4π when integrated over any volume that includes the origin.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, which would make the integral zero. But that's not correct because the divergence is a distribution (delta function) that contributes at the origin.

So, the correct value of the integral is 4π, which matches option A.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the Divergence Theorem. The volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. The flux for this field through a sphere of radius R is ∫ f · dA = ∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ ∫ (over θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π). The 1/R² and R² cancel, so it's ∫ sinθ dθ ∫ dφ. The theta integral is 2, the phi integral is 2π. So 2 * 2π=4π. So the flux is 4π, which must be equal to the volume integral of the divergence. So the volume integral is 4π, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the divergence as zero, that suggests that the volume integral would be zero, but that's because the divergence is zero except at the origin. But since the origin is included in the sphere, the divergence contributes a delta function, which when integrated gives 4π.

So the correct answer is A) 4π.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin, we start by analyzing the field. The field is radial, with magnitude \( f(r) = 1/r^2 \), and it has no components in the angular directions in spherical coordinates.

### Step 1: Divergence in spherical coordinates
For a radial vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) = F(r) \hat{r} \), the divergence in spherical coordinates is given by:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F(r) \right).
\]
Substituting \( F(r) = 1/r^2 \), we compute:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}(1) = 0.
\]
Thus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field has a singularity.

### Step 2: Volume integral of the divergence
The divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is proportional to a delta function. Specifically, for a radial field \( \mathbf{f}(r) = 1/r^2 \hat{r} \), the divergence is:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r),
\]
where \( \delta^3(r) \) is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin is:
\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_V 4\pi \delta^3(r) \, dV.
\]
The delta function satisfies:
\[
\int_V \delta^3(r) \, dV = 1,
\]
provided the origin is included in the volume \( V \). Therefore:
\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 3: Verification using the Divergence Theorem
The Divergence Theorem states:
\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_{\partial V} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dA,
\]
where \( \partial V \) is the boundary of \( V \). For a sphere of radius \( R \), the outward normal is \( \mathbf{\hat{n}} = \hat{r} \), and the surface element is \( dA = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \). The flux through the surface is:
\[
\int_{\partial V} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dA = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{1}{R^2} R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\int_{\partial V} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dA = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
\]
Thus, the flux through the surface is \( 4\pi \), confirming that the volume integral of the divergence is also \( 4\pi \).

### Final Answer
The volume integral of the divergence of the field inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \).
