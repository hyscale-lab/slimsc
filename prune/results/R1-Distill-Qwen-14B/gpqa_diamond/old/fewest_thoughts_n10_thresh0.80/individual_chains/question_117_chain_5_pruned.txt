Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? These are also called enantiomers. They have the same molecular formula and physical properties except for the direction they rotate plane-polarized light.

The question gives four moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's look at each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are nitro at 6 and 6' and carboxylate at 2 and 2'. Wait, so each ring has substituents in certain positions. If the rings are connected in a way that allows for rotation around the single bond between them, then the molecule could have stereoisomerism. But wait, if it's [1,1'-biphenyl], the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. That allows for free rotation, so any stereocenters on each ring would have to be considered. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 2,2' and 6,6'. Are there any stereocenters here? The carboxylate esters are at 2 and 2', which are substituents on the benzene rings. But wait, in aromatic rings, substituents can be in certain positions, but the ring itself doesn't have a configuration. Unless the substituents create a situation where the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

Wait, or maybe the molecule has a center of chirality. Like, if the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that there's a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are symmetrical, then maybe the molecule is not chiral. But in this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and carboxylate at 2. Are those positions across from each other? If the two rings are such that the substituents are in positions that mirror each other, the molecule might not be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry or not. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about whether there's a stereogenic center.

Wait, the carboxylate esters are O-C-O groups. Are the ester groups attached in a way that creates a stereocenter? The structure is dimethyl, so each ester is OMe. The two ester groups are at 2 and 2' positions. So each ring has the ester at 2, and the nitro at 6. So, on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Are these positions para to each other on the benzene ring? Because 2 and 6 are adjacent to each other across the ring. Wait, benzene rings have six positions. Position 1 is where the rings are connected. Position 2 is adjacent to 1, position 3 is next to 2, etc. So, 2 and 6 are across from each other, meaning they are para. So each ring has two substituents: a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at
