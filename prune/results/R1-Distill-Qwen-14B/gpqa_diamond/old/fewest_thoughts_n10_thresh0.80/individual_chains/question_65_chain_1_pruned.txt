Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take my time and think through each part carefully.

The question has two reactions, A and B, and I need to choose the correct option from A to D. Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+.

Hmm, what's the structure of the starting material? Spiro compounds have two rings joined by a single atom. The formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, that's a spiro system where one ring is a 3-membered and the other 5-membered. The 'non' suggests nine carbons, but since it's spiro, probably each ring has a certain number of carbons.

Wait, spiro[3.5]non means the two rings are connected at one carbon. The first part is a three-membered ring (maybe cyclopropane?), and the second a five-membered ring (like cyclopentane or something else). The substituents are a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) and an OH group on the same carbon where the spiro junction is.

The reaction conditions are THF, which is a solvent. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base, and then H+ probably an acidic work-up.

So, what's happening here? With a strong base like KH, which is a good deprotonating agent, but in THF, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by some kind of elimination. But wait, the starting alcohol has an OH group. So perhaps it's an elimination reaction, like a E2 mechanism.

Wait, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the OH is on a carbon that is part of the spiro structure. So, the alcohol is on one of the bridgehead carbons. In such cases, elimination can lead to ring-forming reactions, perhaps annulation.

Wait, when an alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH, it could deproton
