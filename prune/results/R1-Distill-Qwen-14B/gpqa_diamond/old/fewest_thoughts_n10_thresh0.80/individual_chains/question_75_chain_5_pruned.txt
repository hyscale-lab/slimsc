Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transfected cells. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The researcher created a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G. They introduced an HA tag at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Then, they transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the plus strand construct sequence, and I'm supposed to find the issue.

Looking at the options, the possible reasons are:

A) HA tag has a missense mutation.
B) Ribosome terminates early.
C) No linker causing proteolysis.
D) Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA.

First, I'll examine the construct sequence provided. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me scan through the sequence for any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) because if there's an early stop, the protein would be truncated and maybe not detected.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let's go through it:

- The sequence starts with ATG...
- Let me check each codon. Let me note that each codon is three nucleotides.

Breaking it down in triplets:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AGC CGC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA AGA GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CCA CTT GCT GCT GAG TGA ... and so on.

Wait, I see a TGA in the first part. Let me count: The first part after ATG is TAC (tyrosine), then CCC (proline), etc. So the third codon is TAC, then next is CCC (pro), then ATA (isoleucine?), CGA is arginine, TGT is cysteine. Then TCA is serine, GAT is asp, TAC is Tyr, etc.

Looking for TGA. Let me check. So after the start codon, the next codons are:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC ... 

Wait, the codon at positions:

Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TAC
7-9: CCC
10-12: ATA
13-15: CGA
16-18: TGT
19-21: TCA
22-24: GAT
25-27: TAC
28-30: GCC
31-33: AAA
34-36: TGA.

Oh! Here's a TGA at positions 34-36. TGA is a stop codon. So the construct has a stop codon (TGA) just after the AAA codon. So the reading frame would terminate here, right?

So the HA tag is at the N-terminus, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. But if the TGA is present, that would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, truncating the protein. So the protein might not be expressed at all or only a small fragment is made, which might not be detected in Western blot if the antibody is against the HA tag or the C-terminal.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would explain the lack of overexpression. So why is there a TGA in the construct?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was introduced at the beginning, but if the construct has
