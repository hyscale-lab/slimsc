Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already found them using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both orbits are circular. The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved.

The question is asking which planet is preferred for observation because it has a higher probability of transiting. The options are A to D, each suggesting a different preference and probability.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. If the star's size is smaller, the planet's chance of passing in front of it from our perspective is higher. Wait, no, actually, it's more about the alignment. The probability is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So probability P ≈ (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis (for circular orbits, it's the radius of the orbit).

Wait, but the RV method gives the mass and the period. The period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. So I need to find the semi-major axis for each planet.

Kepler's third law in the form P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M+m ≈ M. So a³ = (G*M * P²) / (4π²). But considering that both stars have different masses, so Planet_1's host is more massive, which would mean a shorter semi-major axis for the same period? Or wait, no, because Planet_1's period is shorter. Let me think.

Wait, Planet_1 has a period (P1) that's three times shorter than Planet_2's (P2), so P1 = P2 / 3.

Using Kepler's law for each:

a1³ = (G M1 P1²) / (4π²)
a2³
