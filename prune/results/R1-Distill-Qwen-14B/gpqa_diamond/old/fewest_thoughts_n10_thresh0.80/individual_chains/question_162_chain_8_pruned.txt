Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with a radius of 2. Hmm, I remember pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, but the exact details are a bit fuzzy. Let me try to break this down.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions, right? So it's a 2D metric. I think the general form of a metric in 2D is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), which is what we have here. The function g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, right? The metric given might be representing a space with hyperbolic geometry. So I need to figure out the area of such a surface with radius 2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The radius in hyperbolic geometry is sometimes called the 'curvature radius'. The area of a pseudosphere with radius r is (2π r²) * something? Wait, for a sphere in spherical geometry, the area is 4πr². But for hyperbolic, it's different because the space is infinite.

Wait, no. Let me think again. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But when we talk about the area, especially in hyperbolic space, the area can be a bit tricky because of the infinite extent. Oh wait, maybe the metric given is for a finite area, like on a compact surface. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me see, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which is similar to the metric in the Poincaré disk model. In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually something like (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. But here, our denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So, if I let R = 2, then x² + y² = r², and the denominator is 4(1 - (r²/4)) = 4( (4 - r²)/4 ) = (4 - r²). So the metric becomes (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²) if I switch to polar coordinates.

Wait, that would make the metric ds² = (32) / (4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, but let me see how the Poincaré disk model's metric is structured. The standard Poincaré disk model has curvature -1/(R)^2, where R is the radius. The metric is ds² = (4 R²)/(R² - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), which would be 4(1 - (r²/4)) = 4 (1 - (r^2)/4^2 *4?), wait maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric to find the radius of curvature.

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K of a metric ds² = E dx² + 2F dx dy + G dy² is given by:

K = (-1/(2√(EG))) * [ (∂_x (E/√(EG))) + (∂_y (G/√(EG))) ) ]

In our case, E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and F =0 because there's no cross term. So √(EG) = sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) = 32/(4 - r²), where r²= x² + y².

So, the expression becomes:

K = (-1/(2*(32/(4 - r²))) ) [ ∂_x ( (32/(4 - r²)) / (32/(4 - r²)) ) + ∂_y ( same ) ]

Wait, (E/√(EG)) is (E)/(√(E G)) ) = (E) / (sqrt(E) sqrt(G)) ) = sqrt(E)/sqrt(G) ). But since E=G here, E/√(EG) = 1. So each term inside the brackets is the derivative of 1 with respect to x and y. But derivatives of 1 are zero. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate. Let me define E = G = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So E = G = 32/(4 - r²). Then, √(EG) = sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) = 32/(4 - r²). So E/√(EG) = 32/(4 - r²) divided by 32/(4 - r²) ) = 1. Same for G/√(EG) = 1.

So the partial derivatives of 1 with respect to x and y are zero. So K = (-1/(2*(32/(4 - r²))) ) * (0 + 0) ) = 0. But that can't be right because the metric should have negative curvature for a pseudosphere. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the Gaussian curvature formula.

Alternative approach: For a metric in polar coordinates (r, θ), with ds² = g(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is given by K = - (1/(2 r²)) (d/d r (r² √g(r)) ) ).

Wait, another formula I remember is for the Gaussian curvature in 2D polar coordinates:

K = - (1/(2 r²)) d/dr [ r² sqrt(g_{rr}) ]

Wait, maybe that's a better approach. So let's rewrite the given metric in polar coordinates. Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

So, the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So g_{
