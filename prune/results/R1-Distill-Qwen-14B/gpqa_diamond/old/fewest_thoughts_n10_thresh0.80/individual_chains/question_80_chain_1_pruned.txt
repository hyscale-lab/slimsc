Okay, so I've got this problem here about an algorithm that takes DNA sequences as input and gives numerical outputs. The question provides two examples: AGG gives 115, and TGCTGA gives 176. Then, I'm supposed to figure out what the output is for the sequence ACAGTGACC.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but let me think. I remember that sometimes DNA sequences are converted into numbers based on the nucleotides. Each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) is assigned a numerical value, and then perhaps each position is multiplied by a power of a base, like 4 or something, and summed up.

Wait, what's the standard way to convert DNA sequences to numbers? Oh right, each nucleotide is given a value: A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Maybe each position is multiplied by 4 raised to the power of its position from the right. Or wait, sometimes it's the other way around, with the leftmost being the higher power. Like in some numbering systems, the left is the most significant digit.

Let me test this with the given examples.

First example: AGG -> 115.

Let's break it down. So the sequence is A G G.

If each position is assigned a value and multiplied by 4^(n), where n starts from 0 on the right.

So the rightmost is position 0, then moving left.

For AGG:
A is at position 1, G at 0, G at 0? Wait, no, the length is 3, so positions are 0,1,2. Wait, perhaps it's 4^(length - position -1). Or maybe I'm getting it backwards.

Wait, maybe each character is a digit in a base-4 number, and the entire string is converted into a number. So A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Then the string is treated as a base-4 number.

Wait, let's see. For AGG:

A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So the string is 1 4 4 in base 4.

But wait, base 4 digits can only be 0 to 3, right? Because each digit is a power of 4. So having digits 4 in a base 4 number wouldn't work. So maybe the mapping is different. Hmm, perhaps it's a base-5 system? Or maybe each letter is A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. But let's check.

Wait, the first example is AGG giving 115. Let me try to compute.

If each letter is A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Then the string is A G G, which would be 1,4,4. If it's a base 4 number
