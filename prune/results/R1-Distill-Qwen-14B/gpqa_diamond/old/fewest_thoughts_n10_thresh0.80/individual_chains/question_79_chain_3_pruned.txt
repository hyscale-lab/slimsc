Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about an experiment where compound X, with the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I have to identify compound X from the options.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation reaction. Sharpless epoxidation is for epoxidizing epoxides from alkenes, especially in diastereoselective conditions. So, the product here would be an epoxide, I think. So compound X must be an alkene because epoxidation adds an oxygen across a double bond.

So the product is an epoxide, and the starting material X is an alkene. So the product is an epoxide of X.

Looking at the options, all of them seem to be various types of epoxides. Let me check the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Styryl is a benzene ring with a double bond, so this would be an epoxide attached to a styryl group at position 2.

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Hmm, that's an epoxide where the substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl on the first carbon.

Wait, let me parse that. 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure would be Ph-C=C-CH2-O. Or is it Ph-CH2-C=O? No, wait, no. So the substituent is on the epoxide's oxygen. The structure would be O-C-(CH2Ph-CH2) or something else. Maybe I should draw this out.

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the epoxide has substituents at positions 2 and 3. The 3 position has a styryl group, which is a benzene ring with a double bond.

D) 2-styrylepoxide. That would be an epoxide with a styryl group attached to the oxygen at position 2. So, the structure is O-C-(Ph-CH2-CH2?) Wait, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is a benzene ring with a double bond. So styryl is like Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2, but I'm not sure. Wait, styryl is (Ethenyl)benzene. So, styryl group is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. So, the structure would be O-C-(CH2Ph-CH2), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, so the product is an epoxide, and the NMR data is given for the product. But the question is to identify the starting compound X, which is the alkene. So the reaction is Sharpless epoxidation of X to form the epoxide.

So perhaps the NMR data is for the epoxide, and I need to figure out what the alkene was.

Wait, but the NMR data is given as the product's. So the product has a certain structure, which can give clues about the starting material.

Let me look at the NMR data.

1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets for 3H each. So two methyl groups, each as singlets. That suggests they're attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like being attached to a carbonyl or perhaps in a symmetric position. Wait, but in an epoxide, the oxygens are connected to two carbons. So perhaps the methyl groups are attached to those carbons.

In the epoxide, the two carbons each have a substituent. If each has a methyl group, then in the NMR, each would be a singlet if they are equivalent. Wait, but the two signals are at 2.28 and 2.31, very close. So maybe they are methyl groups attached to two different carbons, but why are they singlets? Because the environment around each methyl is such that they don't split each other's signals. Or perhaps they are attached to more substituted positions.

Wait, but in an epoxide, the two adjacent carbons each have an oxygen. So, if each of those carbons has a methyl group, that would fit. Let's imagine the epoxide is O-CR2-CH2... No, wait, an epoxide is O connecting two adjacent carbons, each of which is connected to two other groups. So, for example, if the structure is (CH3)O-CR2-CH2-... or similar. But in the options, the substituents are styryl groups or others.

Wait, let's analyze the 13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

So, 197 ppm is a strong indicator. That’s a carbonyl group, probably an epoxide's oxygenated carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 197 is more like a ketone or an ester group. Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually in the 60-70 ppm range. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, let me think: the epoxide carbons are typically around 40-70 ppm. But 197 is much higher. That's more like a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So, perhaps this is a carbonyl group in the molecule. But the original compound X is an alkene, so after epoxidation, the product is an epoxide, which shouldn't have a carbonyl. Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, wait, maybe the epoxide is part of a ring, and there's another carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is in a different part of the molecule.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula isn't given. Compound X is C11H12O. Adding an oxygen (epoxide adds one O), so the product would be C11H10O2, perhaps. Hmm, but in the 13C NMR, there's a carbon at 197, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the product is not just an epoxide but another functional group as well, like an ester or ketone. Hmm, but the starting material is just an alkene. So perhaps the product is an epoxide with a ketone group. So how would that happen?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material X is a substituted styrene (vinyl benzene), which upon epoxidation becomes an epoxide, which in the NMR shows some carbonyls. But wait, epoxidation doesn't introduce carbonyls. Unless the original molecule has a carbonyl group, but the starting formula is C11H12O, which could be a ketone or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 ppm is an epoxide oxygenated carbon. Wait, no, because epoxide carbons are usually around 60-70. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe that's a carbonyl group from somewhere else.

Wait, let me think. The product is the epoxide. So if the initial X is, say, a styrene with substituents, then the epoxide would have two adjacent carbons each connected to substituents. Let me think about the NMR signals.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic region:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

So four peaks in the aromatic region. Let's think about how that would split. Suppose there's a para-substituted benzene ring. Then, the H NMR would show a doublet of doublets, or perhaps two doublets if there are substituents in the ortho positions.

Wait, but in this case, the signals are:

One d (1H), then another d (2H), another d (1H), and another d (2H). That suggests maybe a meta-substituted group or perhaps a 1,3-disubstituted ring.

Wait, another possibility: it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, making a styrene structure. The epoxidation would create an epoxide with two adjacent carbons, each attached to a phenyl group.

Wait, but let's imagine a structure where the epoxide is part of a substituent on a benzene ring. For example, if the epoxide is attached to a benzene ring via a CH2 group, then the aromatic signals would come from the ring.

But wait, the H NMR has four aromatic signals. Let's count:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

So that's a total of 1+2+1+2=6 aromatic protons. Wait, that can't be because a benzene ring has six protons. So perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzene with some substituents causing splitting.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR has 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s). So that's 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 carbons. Plus the others.

Wait, 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, 130.3—so four different carbons in the aromatic region. And 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C) are probably carbons attached to substituents, like carbons bearing the epoxide or attached to a double bond.

So let me think: perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents. For example, a para-disubstituted ring. But that would give two sets of peaks. Alternatively, a meta substituent.

Wait, but the H NMR has four distinct aromatic signals, which is a bit confusing. Maybe it's a substituent that's causing splitting into multiple peaks. Alternatively, if the substituent is an epoxide, which is itself a substituent that's causing the splitting.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the epoxide is part of a substituent on the benzene ring. For example, if the epoxide is attached as an ethylene
