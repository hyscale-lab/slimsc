Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, right, I remember that when an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs a photon, and this is governed by selection rules. 

The question is about the state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I need to find the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, let me recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen. The selection rules for hydrogen are usually:

Δn = ±1, ±2, ... but for a dipole transition, the most common are Δn = ±1 and ±2, but I think in this case, since it's going from n=3 to n=1, it's a two-photon process. Wait, no, the question says via two dipole transitions. So it's a two-step process.

Wait, no, the state |3,0,0> decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. So, it must go through an intermediate state. So the decay isn't a single step but two steps. So first, from 3,0,0 to some state, then from there to 1,0,0.

So what can be the possible intermediate states? Let's think about the selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, the change in l (the angular momentum quantum number) is Δl = ±1. Also, the change in m (magnetic quantum number) is Δm = 0, ±1. And for the principal quantum number n, the change Δn can be ±1, but wait, in a single dipole transition, usually Δn is ±1. So from n=3 to n=2, or n=1, but wait, no, because going from 3 to 1 would require a two-photon transition or maybe a two-step process.

Wait, no, the question says it's two dipole transitions. So each transition is a dipole, so each must obey Δn=±1, Δl=±1, Δm=0, ±1.

So going from 3,0,0 to some state, then to 1,0,0.

Let me see. So first transition: n=3 → n=2 or n=1? But n=3 to n=2 would be one step, then n=2 to n=1 would be another. So the intermediate state would be n=2, but what l and m?

Wait, initial state is l=0, m=0. So in the first transition, from l=0 to l=1, because Δl=±1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. Because from l=0, you can go to l=1 or l=-1, but since l can't be negative, it goes to l=1.

So the intermediate state would have l=1.

So for the first transition: n=3, l=0 → n=2, l=1. Because Δl must be +1 or -1. But l can't be negative, so Δl = +1.

So the first transition could be |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>, where m can be 0, +1, or -1.

Wait, but the change in m must be 0, ±1. So for the first transition, m goes from 0 to m1, which can be 0, +1, or -1.

Then, the second transition takes the system from |2,1, m1> to |1,0,0>.

Wait, let's think about the second transition. The starting l is 1, and the ending l is 0. So Δl must be -1, which is allowed.

So the second transition must have Δl= -1.

Now, the change in n must be from 2 to 1, so Δn= -1.

So for
