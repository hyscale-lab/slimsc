Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments' combined rest mass is 99% of the initial mass M. Also, one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. The question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 value and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in MeV, so the difference is probably going to be a few MeV, but I'm not sure yet.

Hmm, so first, I need to model this scenario. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Their masses are in a 2:1 ratio. Let's denote the masses as m1 and m2, where m1 is more massive. So m1 = 2m2. But wait, wait. Because the sum of their rest masses is 0.99M. Oh right, because the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m1 is twice m2, let's substitute. m1 = 2m2. So 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M. Therefore, m2 = 0.99M /3 = 0.33M, and m1 = 0.66M.

But wait, the problem says to ignore electrons. Oh, right, so we don't have to worry about any electrons being emitted or anything like that. So it's just the two fragments, their masses, and their kinetic energies.

So since the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the velocities as v1 and v2. But wait, since we're dealing with relativistic effects, maybe velocities aren't as straightforward.

Wait, the problem is asking about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So we need to calculate T1 relativistically and subtract the non-relativistic T1 to find the difference.

But wait, no. The question says, the correct T1 minus the classical approximation's T1. So the difference is T1 (relativistic) - T1 (non-relativistic).

So let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's find the velocities of the two fragments. Because the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the relativistic momentum of each fragment must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

The momentum p is given by gamma*m*v for each fragment. So for fragment 1 (mass m1), p1 = gamma1 * m1 * v1. Similarly, p2 = gamma2 *
