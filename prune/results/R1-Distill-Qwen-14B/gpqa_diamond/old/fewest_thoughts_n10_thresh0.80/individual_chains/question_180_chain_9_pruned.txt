Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, just potential energy maybe.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm. So point P is where the 13th charge is. The others are all 2 meters away from P. So I guess they form some kind of spherical arrangement around P?

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. I think that's potential energy. Since the system is isolated, minimum energy probably refers to the potential energy state. But wait, potential energy can be positive or negative. I remember that for a system of point charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So to find the minimum energy, I need to calculate the total potential energy of the system. Wait, but how? Let me think. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Right.

But wait, when you have multiple charges, you have to consider all possible pairs. So for each pair, you calculate the potential energy and sum them up.

So in this problem, there are 13 charges. But wait, one is fixed at P, and the others are at 2 meters from P. So the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 is 2 meters away from the 13th charge.

Wait, but the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P. So each of them is 2 meters away from the charge at P. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other? Since they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, they must lie on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m. So maybe the distance between any two of the 12 charges depends on the angle between them. But wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, in a system of charges on a sphere, the potential energy depends on their arrangement. To minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes it. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, if the charges are identical and positive, they would repel each other. So to minimize potential energy, which is usually negative (since like charges attract? Wait no, wait, no. Wait, wait. Potential energy between two positive charges is positive because they repel. So when you bring them together, you're doing work, so the potential energy is positive. So a system with more separation would have higher (more positive) potential energy. Wait no, wait. Wait, the formula U = k q1 q2 / r. For two positive charges, that's positive, and as r increases, U increases. So putting them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy? No, wait, wait. No, wait, because if you have two positive charges, their potential energy is higher when r is smaller. Because U is positive and as r decreases, U increases. So wait, that would mean that the potential energy is higher when charges are closer. So when charges are forced to be closer, the potential energy is higher. So lower values of r lead to higher (more positive) U. So for minimum energy, you want the potential energy to be as low as possible. But for positive charges, the potential energy can't be negative because U = positive. So the minimum in that case would be the lowest possible positive value, which would be when the charges are as far apart as possible.

Wait, but
