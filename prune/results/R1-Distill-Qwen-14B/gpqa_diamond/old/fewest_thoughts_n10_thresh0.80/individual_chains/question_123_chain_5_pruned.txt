Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a supernova in our galaxy. Part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? 

Wait, wait. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 6e4 km/s. But the problem says to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm. I think this is a problem involving relative velocity and time dilation, maybe using special relativity. Since both frames are inertial, we can use the Lorentz transformations.

Let me outline what I know. So, in the ejecta's frame (let's call it frame S'), the galaxy (frame S) is moving towards them at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. Wait, but waitâ€”wait, no. No, wait, in S', which is the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's frame (S), what is the ejecta's velocity?

Wait, in the problem, the ejecta is moving towards the center. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v. Oh, so it's the same speed but opposite direction in each frame.

So in S (galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the galaxy. In S' (ejecta frame), the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v. So the speed is the same in magnitude, but opposite in direction in each frame.

Wait, but wait a second. If in S', the galaxy is moving at velocity v towards the ejecta, then in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the galaxy. Because in each frame, the relative speed is v. So, yes, that's correct.

Now
