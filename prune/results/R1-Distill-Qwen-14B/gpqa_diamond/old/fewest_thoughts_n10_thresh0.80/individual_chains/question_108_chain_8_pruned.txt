Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so I'm guessing m is either 0 or maybe ±1, but not a large number. We're to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength. Since ΔE is the energy difference between two states, I remember that the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So I can calculate ΔE using Planck's constant h, the speed of light c, and the given wavelength λ.

Let me jot down the values I need. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters.

So calculating ΔE would be (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m). Let me compute that. Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: so 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = approximately 4.088e-19 J. Hmm, but wait, usually energy levels are expressed in electronvolts. Let me convert that. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4.088e-19 J is about 2.553 eV. Wait, that seems a bit high for a hydrogen transition. Oh wait, the Balmer series is around visible light, like 0.4 micrometers corresponds to about 3 eV? Maybe I did a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate. Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about the wavelength for the Balmer-alpha line, which is the H-alpha line, right? Its energy difference is about 1.89 eV, I think. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute. Planck's equation: E = hc/λ. Let me compute hc first. h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So hc = 1.9878e-25 J·m. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. So E = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (0
