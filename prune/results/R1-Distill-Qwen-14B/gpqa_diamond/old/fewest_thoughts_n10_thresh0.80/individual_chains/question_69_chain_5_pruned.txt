Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The setup is in the CERN Bubble Chamber with an energy of 27 GeV and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be affected by their speed relative to the observer. Proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is longer because of time dilation. The formula for the observed lifetime τ is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But how do I find γ? Oh right, γ is calculated using the total energy of the particle. The formula is γ = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass. So here, E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV. So let me calculate that. 

E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41... Well, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 8 is 27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.91. So γ is approximately 7.91.

So the observed lifetime is τ = γ τ₀ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let's calculate that. 7.91 *8 = 63.28. So τ ≈ 63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does this relate to the resolution needed? Oh, right, the problem is about the minimum resolution required in the bubble chamber to observe the decay. I think the resolution refers to the length over which the decay products can be detected, so it's about the distance the particles travel before decaying. 

The distance a particle travels before decaying is given by the speed multiplied by the lifetime. The problem is that the decay will only be observed if the particles travel a distance that the chamber's resolution can capture. So if the decay occurs too close to the point of production, the chamber can't distinguish it from the production point if the resolution is too low.

The fraction of decays observed would depend on the probability that the particle decays within the chamber's resolution. So we need to find the distance L such that at least 30% (0.3) of the particles decay within L.

The decay follows an exponential law: the probability P that a particle decays within a certain distance L is P = 1 - e^(-L/λ), where λ is the mean decay length. The mean decay length λ is c * τ, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, but particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so their speed is approximately c. So I can approximate their speed as c. So λ ≈ c * τ.

So the mean decay length λ = c * τ. Then the probability P is 1 - e^(-L/λ). We want P >= 0.3.

So setting up the equation: 0.3 = 1 - e^(-L/λ). Rearranging, e^(-L/λ) = 0.7. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -L/λ = ln(0.7). So L = -λ * ln(0.7).

Alternatively, since
