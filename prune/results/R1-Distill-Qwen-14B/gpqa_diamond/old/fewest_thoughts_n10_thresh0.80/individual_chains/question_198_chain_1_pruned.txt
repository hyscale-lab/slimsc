Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me read the question again. 

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? I remember that [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes have different colors depending on the number of thiocyanate ligands. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex, which is the tetrahedral one. Or wait, no, maybe the hexagonal is another color. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the stability constants to figure out the distribution of the complexes.

Stability constants tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the most stable complex will have the highest β. Looking at the given β's: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the highest, which would be the [Co(SCN)_3]^ something complex. Then β2 is next, and β4 is lower than β1? Wait, β4 is 16, which is less than β1=9? No, wait, 16 is higher than 9. So the order is β3 (63) > β2 (40) > β4 (16) > β1 (9). So the most stable is the third complex, followed by the second, then fourth, then first. But wait, wait—no, wait, I think I got that wrong. Stability constants are in the order of which? For Co(II) complexes with SCN-, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{3+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{4+}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{5+} perhaps? Or maybe the charges are different. Hmm, but the exact charges might not be critical here because the solution's ionic strength might influence activity, but I think we can ignore activity coefficients for this problem.

The problem is about the distribution of the different complexes. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{3+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{4+}, [Co(SCN)_4]^{5+}.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I need to find which complex is the blue one. From what I remember, the tetrahedral [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue, whereas the octahedral might be a different color. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, maybe the dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^
