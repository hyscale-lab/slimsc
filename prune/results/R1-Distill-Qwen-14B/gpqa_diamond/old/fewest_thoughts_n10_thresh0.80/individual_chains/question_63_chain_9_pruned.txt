Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

First, let's parse the given data:

Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
Angular frequency (w) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are four different momenta values, all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 N*s.

Wait, so the question is about the molecule absorbing a photon and moving to the next state. Since it's in the fundamental state, that's probably the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state would be the next higher energy level.

But wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or maybe J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid or non-rigid rotor). Hmm, actually, for diatomic molecules, the rotational states are quantized as well. But the non-rigid rotor model might include centrifugal distortion, but I don't know if that's needed here.

Wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Photon momentum is equal to E/c, where E is the energy of the photon. So if I can find the energy required for the transition, then I can find the momentum.

But what's the transition here? The molecule is moving from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (like J=1 if J=0 is the ground state).

Wait, but in the quantum mechanical treatment, the total energy is a sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the energy levels would be E_total = E_rot + E_vib
