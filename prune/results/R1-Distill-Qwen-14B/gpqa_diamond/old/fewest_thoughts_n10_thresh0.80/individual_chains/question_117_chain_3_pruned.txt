Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has something to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images, which means they can rotate plane-polarized light. Those are called enantiomers. But wait, what conditions are needed for a molecule to show optical isomerism?

I think the main thing is that the molecule must have a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Also, sometimes there are other factors like axial chirality, but I'm more familiar with chiral centers.

Let me look at each of the given options one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, this looks a bit complicated. So it's a biphenyl structure with substituents. At positions 2 and 2' on each benzene ring, there are carboxylate groups (since it's methyl ester). Also, at positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups.

Wait, in biphenyl structures, especially when the rings are connected at 1 and 1', the substituents can be on the same side or opposite sides, creating diastereomers. Oh wait, but does that lead to optical isomerism? I think that in biphenyls with substituents in certain positions, the molecule can have axial chirality, which is when the two rings are connected in a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror image. So if the substituents are on opposite sides or something, maybe the molecule can have enantiomers.

But wait, for axial chirality, the biphenyl needs to have substituents in such a way that they create a plane of symmetry. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. If the substituents are on the same positions on each ring, but on opposite sides, like cis or trans, would that lead to optical isomerism? Alternatively, maybe if the substituents are in such positions that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe if the substituents cause the molecule to have a center of chirality. Alternatively, another possibility is that the molecule may have multiple stereocenters.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule has two nitro groups and two ester groups. Let me imagine the structure. The two benzene rings are connected in a biphenyl structure. Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So each ring has substituents at opposite positions (ortho to each other? Or maybe para? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 2 is adjacent to 1, so 6 would be across the ring from 2? Wait, benzene has positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 in a circle. So position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. Position 2 is connected to 1 and 3. So 2 and 6 are across the ring? No, wait, in a benzene ring, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So 2 is next to 1, 3 is next to 2, so 6 is the opposite of 3? Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. The biphenyl is connected at position 1
