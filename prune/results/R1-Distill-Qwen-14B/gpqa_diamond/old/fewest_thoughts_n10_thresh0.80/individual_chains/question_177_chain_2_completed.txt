Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember something about the peak wavelength being related to temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! The peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both have the same peak wavelength, they must be at the same temperature. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, the problem also gives their radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, which probably means it's not moving towards or away from us much. Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But wait, how does radial velocity affect this? Oh, I think that when a star moves towards us or away, there's a Doppler shift. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift is already accounted for, or perhaps the velocities are given for some other consideration. Hmmm... Not entirely sure yet, but perhaps it's a red herring for calculating luminosity. Let me focus on the main question.

The question is about the luminosity ratio. Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Since both are black bodies, and their peak wavelengths are same, their temperatures are same. So T1 = T2. So for luminosity ratio, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, that ratio reduces to (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but the problem says that the luminosity computed is greater by a factor. So R1 is 1.5 R2. So L1/L2 should be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer would be option A, which is ~2.25. But wait, why are the other options present? Let me check again.

Wait, but wait a minute. Could the velocities affect something else? Because radial velocity affects the observed flux, but the question is about luminosity, not observed flux. Luminosity is an intrinsic property. Observed flux F is L/(4πd²), where d is distance. But if the stars are moving, does that affect their distance? Or perhaps their apparent brightness due to Doppler boosting?

Wait, Doppler effect can change the observed flux. Because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, which can affect the observed brightness. But wait, the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. If Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but the peak wavelength is same after considering any Doppler shift, that would mean their temperatures are same as per their rest frames. So, the observed wavelength might change due to Doppler, but since the peak is the same, perhaps their rest frame temperatures are same. So the radial velocities wouldn't affect the actual temperature, because the observed wavelength would be shifted, but the problem says the observed wavelengths are same. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift is negligible or accounted for in determining the temperature. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are same, so perhaps the Doppler effect is already considered, and the temperatures are same. So the velocities might not affect the luminosity calculation because luminosity is based on intrinsic properties (radius and temperature).

So, the luminosity ratio is just (R1/R2)^2, because T1=T2.

So R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the factor is ~2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the star's mass affects the luminosity? Because higher mass stars can have different luminosity classes. Oh, but the problem says to assume they are black bodies radiating, so the mass might not directly affect the luminosity in this context. Mass relates more to other factors like fusion rates, but the question specifies using black body radiation, so I think we don't need to consider the mass beyond what's given for radius. So the mass being 1.5 times larger doesn't directly factor into the luminosity calculation as the problem is framed.

So, yes, the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 = (3/2)^2 = 9/4 = 2.25. So the correct answer should be option A, ~2.25.

Wait another thing: but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity. So perhaps considering the Doppler shift when computing the luminosity... Wait, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. So if a star is moving, its observed flux would change due to Doppler boosting. Wait, but the problem says the luminosity "of Star_1" is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the observed flux is being used, but luminosity is the actual output.

Wait, no. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so the Doppler shift shouldn't affect it. Hence, luminosity is based only on R and T, which are same for both in terms of T (since peak wavelengths same) and R is 1.5 times larger.

So why are the other options even there? Let's think again.

Wait, no, wait a second. The problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the observed luminosity is being considered, but actually, the Doppler effect could influence the observed flux. Hmm.

Wait, the observed flux F is given by F = L / (4πd²) * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is radial velocity. Because when a star is moving towards us, the flux increases due to Doppler boosting. But in this case, Star_1 has v_r =0, so no boost. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. If Star_2 is moving away, v_r positive (assuming away), then the observed flux would be less. But the problem is about luminosity, not observed flux. So the question is about the actual luminosity, not the observed flux.

Alternatively, if the luminosity is computed from the observed flux, then maybe the Doppler shift affects the calculation. But the problem says to assume the stars are black bodies. So perhaps the observed flux is F = (L /4πd²) * (1 + v_r / c). But the distance d would vary if the stars are moving. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, but the question states: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So the luminosity is computed based on their black body radiation. So perhaps the Doppler shift is considered in the calculation of luminosity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity measurement is a red herring, and the problem is straightforward.

Wait, but the question is about the luminosity. So the luminosity formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. If T is same for both, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, so the answer is A.

But let's think again: the radial velocities might affect the observed temperature or radius. Wait, no. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would make the observed wavelength shorter. But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are same, so any Doppler shift must have been accounted for. So the actual temperatures (in rest frame) are same.

So, R is 1.5 times bigger, T is same. So L1/L2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer is A.


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The key information provided is:

1. **Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2**: This means \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **The stars have the same peak wavelength**: According to Wien's Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (\( \lambda_{\text{peak}} \propto 1/T \)). Since the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures of both stars are equal (\( T_1 = T_2 \)).
3. **Radial velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. However, since the problem specifies that the stars' peak wavelengths are the same, any Doppler shifts due to radial velocity have already been accounted for, and the intrinsic temperatures are unaffected.

The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Since \( T_1 = T_2 \), the luminosity ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25. The radial velocities and the mass of the stars are not directly relevant to the calculation of luminosity under the assumptions provided.

**Answer: A**
