Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the formation of more stable complexes, right? So the higher the β, the more stable the complex.

First, I need to figure out the different complexes that can form. Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate in different stoichiometries. So the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+, I think. Let me see: the possible complexes would be Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. Because the stability constants are given up to β4=16. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the way stability constants work, β1 is for the first step, right? Like the first complex is Co(SCN), and each βn is the formation constant for adding another SCN^-.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Stability constants (formation constants) are for successive additions. So β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)_1^2+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-. Then β2 is the constant for Co(SCN)_2^2+ from Co(SCN)_1^2+ and another SCN^-, and so on. So each β represents the stepwise addition.

So the overall process would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_1^2+ ; β1 = 9

Co(SCN)_1^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^2+ ; β2 = 40

Co(SCN)_2^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^2+ ; β3 = 63

Co(SCN)_3^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2+ ; β4 = 16

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN^- ligands, so Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that. Wait no, wait, I'm not exactly sure which complex is the blue one. But I think in the context of this problem, the question is about Co(SCN)_2^2+, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So that's the species we're interested in.

To find the percentage of this species, we need to calculate the fraction of Co^2+ that's in the form of Co(SCN)_2^2+ among all possible Co species.

So, the approach is to model the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum them up, then find the fraction of the desired complex.

The formula for the fraction of each Co complex is given by:

f_n = (β1β2...βn) / (1 + β1 + β1β2 + β1β2β3 + ... + β1β2β3...β4 )

Wait, no, wait. The fraction of each complex is calculated considering the stepwise formation constants.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) / [sum over k from 0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βk) (SCN^-)^(k) ) / (Co^(2+) * (SCN^-)^0 + ... ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to use the expressions for the conditional formation constants considering the ligand concentration.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with multiple equilibria, the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formation constants and the concentrations.

So the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the charges. Co^2+ is +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So:

- Co(SCN)_1^2+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is 2+ + (-1) = 1+.

Wait, wait, no: the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} would be 2+ - n*(1), because each SCN^- contributes -1. So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

Hmm, but maybe the charges aren't too important for this problem. Let's focus on the fractions.

The fraction of each complex can be calculated as:

f_n = (K1 K2 ... Kn) / (1 + K1 + K1 K2 + K1 K2 K3 + ... )

But wait, K here would be the overall formation constant for the nth complex, which is the product of the stepwise β's.

Wait, no. The overall formation constant K_n is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, the problem gives β1, β2, β3, β4 as the stepwise formation constants. So the overall K for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the first n β's.

So K1 = β1 =9.

K2 = β1 * β2 =9*40=360.

K3=9*40*63= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

K4=22680 *16=362880.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again.

The fraction f_n is equal to (K_n * [L]^n ) / ( [M] + sum_{i=1 to 4} (K_i [L]^i) ) )

Wait, that might not be precise. Alternatively, the fraction can be found using:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / ( [Co^2+] β0 + [Co^2+] β1 [SCN] + [Co^2+] β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... )

Wait, maybe more accurately, the distribution can be found using the expressions for each species.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as free Co, and the other terms as the complexed forms.

But perhaps a better way is to calculate the ratio of each complex to the total cobalt.

The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] 

Each complex can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and the product of the β's and [SCN^-]^n.

Let me think. The concentration of Co(SCN)_n is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

So [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n, where K_n is the product of first n β's.

Thus, the total concentration of Co is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n] 

= [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} (K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

Factor out [Co^2+], we get:

c_total = [Co^2+] (1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} K_n [SCN^-]^n )

But since c_total is given as 1e-2 M, and [Co^2+] is one of the terms, perhaps we can find [Co^2+] in terms of K's and [SCN^-]^n.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express [Co^2+] in terms of the total cobalt concentration.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:

c_total = x + sum_{n=1 to 4} ( K_n x [SCN^-]^n )

= x ( 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 ( K_n [SCN^-]^n ) )

So,

x = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 ( K_n [SCN^-]^n ) )

Once we find x, the [Co^2+], we can compute each [Co(SCN)_n] as K_n x [SCN^-]^n.

Then, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is ( [Co(SCN)_2] / c_total ) * 100%.

So first, I need to calculate K1, K2, K3, K4.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

K1 = β1 =9.

K2 = β1*β2= 9*40=360.

K3=β1β2β3= 360*63=22680.

K4=22680 *16=362880.

Now, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So for each K_n, compute K_n [SCN^-]^n.

Compute each term:

Term1 (n=1): K1 [SCN]^1 = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9.

Term2 (n=2): K2 [SCN]^2 = 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

Term3 (n=3): 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

Term4 (n=4): 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Now sum all these terms plus 1 (the term for n=0, which is [Co^2+]).

Wait, the denominator in x is 1 + sum terms from n=1 to 4.

So sum_terms = 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me compute that:

0.9 +3.6 =4.5.

4.5 +22.68=27.18.

27.18 +36.288=63.468.

So sum_terms =63.468.

So denominator is 1 +63.468=64.468.

So x = c_total / 64.468.

c_total is given as 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M.

So x = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Now, I need to find [Co(SCN)_2], which is K2 * x * [SCN]^2.

Wait, but wait, [Co(SCN)_2] = K2 x [SCN^-]^2.

Wait, but K2 is 360, and [SCN] is 0.1, so [SCN]^2 is 0.01.

But let me compute it:

[Co(SCN)_2] = K2 * x * [SCN]^2

= 360 * (0.01/64.468) * (0.1)^2

= 360 * (0.0001551) * 0.01.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Wait, wait, x is [Co^2+] =0.01 /64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2] = K2 * x * (0.1)^2.

K2 is 360, so:

360 * (1.551e-4) * 0.01.

Compute 360 *1.551e-4 = approximately 360 * 0.0001551 = 0.055836.

Then multiply by 0.01: 0.055836 * 0.01 = 0.00055836 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] ≈5.5836e-4 M.

But wait, another approach is to compute the fraction f2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]/c_total.

Because c_total is 0.01 M, f2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/0.01.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = f2 *0.01.

But [Co(SCN)_2] = K2 * x * (0.1)^2.

And x = c_total/( sum_terms +1 )

So perhaps another way to compute f2 is:

f2 = (K2 [SCN]^2 )/( sum_terms )

Because:

[Co(SCN)_2] = K2 x [SCN]^2 = K2 * (c_total/(sum_terms +1)) * [SCN]^2

So fraction f2= [Co(SCN)_2]/c_total = ( K2 [SCN]^2 )/( sum_terms +1 )

Wait, sum_terms is 63.468, then sum_terms +1 is 64.468.

So f2= (360 *0.01 ) / 64.468 → wait, because [SCN]^2 is 0.01, so K2 * [SCN]^2 is 360 *0.01=3.6.

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05559, or 5.56%.

Wait, that can't be right because 5% is much lower than any of the options given. The options are 16.9, 25.6, 38.1, 42.3.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, I'm getting f2 about 5.5% which isn't matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me re-examine the approach.

Wait, another way is to compute the fraction f_n as (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n ) / ( [L]^0 + β1 [L]^1 + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

Wait, that might be more accurate. Because each term in the denominator represents the contribution of each complex, including [Co^2+] as the first term.

Wait, but the [L] here is the concentration of SCN^-, which is 0.1 M.

So for n=0 (free Co^2+), it's 1.

n=1: β1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1 β2 [L]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: 9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So the denominator is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5+22.68=28.18; 28.18+36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

The numerator for n=2 would be the same as the denominator's n=2 term, which is 3.6.

Wait, no, the fraction f2 is (n=2 term) / (sum of all terms).

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.0556, or 5.56%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, maybe the blue complexes are higher n? Or perhaps I got the n wrong.

Wait, I thought n=2 is dithiocyanato, but perhaps the correct species is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is the one that's blue. Because I remember that in some cases, the tetrathiocyanato complex is blue. Wait, no, wait, I think the hexachloridocobaltate(II) is blue, but in thiocyanate complexes, the color might vary.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the order of β's wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps the stability constants are given in reverse order. Let me look again. The question says β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, β1 is the first step, β2 the second, etc.

Wait, but in some cases, the β's could be for the overall formation, not stepwise. But the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So I think they are the stepwise constants.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the stability is for the overall complex, and the β's are given as β1 = K1, β2 = K2, etc. So K1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^2+.

Wait, but what if the β's are for the overall complexes, not the stepwise?

Wait, that could change everything. Because if β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^2+, then K1= β1=9.

Then K2, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be β2=40.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the overall constants are larger than the stepwise. Because each step is adding one more ligand, which is less likely to have a higher K.

Wait, maybe the β's are the overall formation constants for each complex. So:

β1 = K1 = [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

β3 = K3 = [Co(SCN)_3^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )

β4 = K4 = [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

In that case, the approach would be different.

If that's the case, then the fractions would be computed using each K as the overall constant for that complex.

But the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So they are given as the stability constants for each complex, not stepwise. So that would mean:

β1 = [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

So, in this case, each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

Hmm, that would change the approach.

In this scenario, the [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So the denominator for [Co^2+] would be:

1 (for [Co^2+]) + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4.

Ah, so that's different from the earlier approach where we multiplied stepwise β's.

So, let me recalculate.

Given [SCN^-] =0.1 M.

So each term is:

Term0: 1 → represents [Co^2+].

Term1: β1 * [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β2 * [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Term3: β3 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

Term4: β4 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9 +0.4=2.3; 2.3 +0.063=2.363; 2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Thus, [Co^2+] = c_total / denominator = 0.01 /2.3646 ≈ 0.004224 M.

Now, the concentration of Co(SCN)_2 is β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2.

So [Co(SCN)_2] =40 * 0.004224 * (0.1)^2.

Compute that:

40 *0.004224 =0.16896.

Multiply by 0.01 (since [SCN]^2 is 0.01) → 0.16896 *0.01=0.0016896 M.

Now, the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/c_total.

c_total is 0.01 M.

So fraction f2= 0.0016896 / 0.01 =0.16896 → 16.896%, which is approximately 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the blue complex was Co(SCN)_4^{2-}, but according to this calculation, the fraction for n=2 is about 16.9%, which is option D.

So the correct answer would be D) 16.9%.

Wait, but why is this the case? Because in this scenario, the β's are overall formation constants, not stepwise.

But the question states that β's are the stability constants of the complexes, which I think implies they are the overall constants.

So I think this approach is correct, leading to option D.


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Total cobalt concentration**: \( c_{\text{Co}} = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

The stability constants (\( \beta_n \)) represent the overall formation constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes:
\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_n]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]
The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species:
\[
c_{\text{Co}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_1^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}]
\]
Each complex concentration can be expressed as:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
\]
Thus, the total concentration becomes:
\[
c_{\text{Co}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
\]
Let \( x = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \). Then:
\[
x = \frac{c_{\text{Co}}}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
\]
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4
\]
\[
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063
\]
\[
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016
\]
Summing these terms:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]
Thus:
\[
x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M}
\]

Next, calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_2^0 ]\):
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot (0.1)^2
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = 40 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot 0.01 = 0.0016896 \, \text{M}
\]

The fraction of \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_2^0 ]\) in the total cobalt concentration is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0]}{c_{\text{Co}}} = \frac{0.0016896}{0.01} \approx 0.16896
\]
Converting to percentage:
\[
f_2 \approx 16.896\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately **16.9%**.
