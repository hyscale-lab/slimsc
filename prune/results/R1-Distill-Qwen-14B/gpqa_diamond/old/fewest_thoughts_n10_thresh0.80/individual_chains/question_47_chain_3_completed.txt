Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound using spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. The options are A to D. Let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 suggest the presence of N-H stretching, maybe from an amide or an amine. Or wait, sometimes amines have N-H stretches around 3300-3500. But the exact positions can vary. However, since there are two bands, maybe it's a secondary amine or an amide. Because primary amines usually show two peaks close together, but sometimes if it's a strong hydrogen bond like in amides, they might be shifted. 

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm^-1. That's a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) appear. So this could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have broader O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which I don't see mentioned here. So maybe it's an ester or an amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data next:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. Triple usually comes from two neighboring protons. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something else, maybe an oxygen, like an ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, a broad peak suggests maybe an exchange process, like an amine or an amide proton. Or maybe it's a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom. But wait, the integration is 2H. If it's an amine, maybe NH2? But in that case, the integration would be 2H but the peak would be broad, but looking at the options, let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm region could be an OCH2 group. Like in an ester, the oxygenated CH2. But I thought the ethyl was at 1.2, so maybe the ethyl is part of something else.

Then, 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet implies four neighbors, so probably a CH2 next to another CH2. Like an ethyl group where each CH2 is next to another. Wait, but the 1.20 is a triplet, which would be the CH3 attached to a CH2. So maybe this quartet is the CH2 attached to the oxygen. So, for example, in an ethyl ester, the group is OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but the 1.2 would be the CH3, and the 4.5 would be the OCH2. So the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to another CH2. That makes sense.

So, putting that together: the ethyl group is part of an ester. So like OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, ethyl ester would be OCH2CH3, but in that case, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be a quartet? Wait, no. Wait, ethyl ester: the O is connected to CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would have two protons, each seeing the adjacent CH2's protons. If the adjacent CH2 has two protons, each proton in the OCH2 would have a triplet. Wait, wait, no—maybe I'm confusing the splitting. Let me think. For an ethyl group in an ester, the O is connected to CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet because each proton in the OCH2 is next to the CH2CH3. Wait, no, the OCH2 is connected to another CH2, which is connected to the CH3. So the OCH2 would split into a quartet because the adjacent CH2 has two protons. Wait, no, the adjacent group is CH2CH3. So OCH2 is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH3. So the OCH2's protons would be split by the adjacent CH2's protons. Since each OCH2 proton is adjacent to two protons (the CH2's), it would be a triplet? Or wait, maybe the OCH2 is split by the neighboring CH2, which has two protons. So each of the OCH2 protons would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR, it's a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of the ethyl group as CH2CH3. In an ethyl ester, the structure is OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's propyl. Ethyl would be OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 is connected to a CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet because each proton in the OCH2 is adjacent to the CH2 group's two protons. Wait, no—wait, the CH2 (OCH2) is connected to another CH3. Wait, no. Let me think of the splitting. If the OCH2 is connected to a CH2CH3 group, then each H on OCH2 is adjacent to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H on OCH2 would see two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR, it's a quartet. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is part of an N-linked group. Like, if it's an amide, maybe the structure is something like RCONHCH2CH2OEt or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the quartet is an OCH2 group in an ester, but perhaps it's part of a benzamide or something else.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide (HCONH-) attached to phenyl with ethoxy at 4.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the propionate (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a phenyl with NH2 at 4.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So benzoate ester (OEt) attached to benzene with NH2 at position 4.

Hmm. So, for the NMR:

The peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each as doublets, 2H each. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent are deshielded and appear as doublets. So for example, if we have a substituent at position 4, then positions 2 and 6 would have the H's as doublets. Wait, but in the case of a benzamide, the substituent is at position 3, as in option A. Wait, no, in option A, the substituents are ethoxy at 3 and the amide group at position 1? Or wait, benzamide would have the amide group attached to the ring. So for 3-ethoxybenzamide, the structure is benzene ring with an amide group (CONH2) at position 1 and an ethoxy group at position 3.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets each of 2H. So that suggests two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but that's perhaps more complicated. Alternatively, if there's a single substituent that deactivates the ring and causes the protons to split into two doublets. For example, a strong deactivating group like -NO2 would cause the adjacent protons to be downfield. But in this case, the substituents could be an amino group and an ester group.

Wait, let's think about para-substituted benzene. If the substituent is at position 4, then the ring would have two protons in the ortho positions (2 and 6), which would be equivalent and show as a doublet each. But in the NMR, we have two doublets, 2H each. So that could be two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, in a meta-substituted benzene, but that would give more complexity. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the ring has two groups causing the two doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an amino group. Let's think about the D option: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is benzene ring with COOEt (ester) group and NH2 at the para position. So the COOEt is at position 1, NH2 at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. But wait, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOEt group, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the NH2 group. But NH2 is a strong activating group, while COOEt is deactivating. But in terms of NMR shifts, the deactivating group would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. So the protons ortho to COOEt (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear around 8 ppm, while the protons ortho to NH2 (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded, perhaps around 7 ppm. So that would explain the two doublets at 7 and 8 ppm.

But looking at the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So the 8 ppm would be the more deshielded (ortho to COOEt), and 7 ppm would be ortho to NH2.

Now, let's look at the other NMR signals. The quartet at 4.5 ppm, 2H: in ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet, perhaps. But in ethyl ester, the OCH2 is connected to a CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet because each H is next to two H's in the adjacent CH2. Wait, but ethyl ester OCH2 is usually a quartet, yes.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet. That's a bit confusing. Since it's a singlet, perhaps it's not split by any neighboring H's. So maybe it's an NH group. Because NH protons can be broad and if there are two H's, perhaps it's an NH2 group. But wait, in that case, the NMR would usually show a broad peak, but integration is 2H. So maybe it's an NH2 group. Alternatively, an oxygenated CH2, but if it's a singlet, perhaps it's attached to something that doesn't have neighboring H's.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which ones have NH groups. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: that has an NH2 group. So in that case, the NH2 would show up as a broad peak, possibly around 4.0 ppm? Wait, but usually amines are around 1-5 ppm. But NH2 in aniline derivatives can be around 4-5 ppm, but I'm not sure about the exact shift. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group, but why would it be a singlet? Maybe if it's a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom and not adjacent to any other H's, but that's a bit unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Could this be the NH2 group in the amide or amine? For example, in an amide, the NH is usually around 6-8 ppm, but maybe in some cases it's lower. Or perhaps it's an NH group that's exchanging and giving a broad peak. But again, the integration is 2H, which would mean it's an NH2 group. So if the compound has an NH2, like option D, then that would fit.

Alternatively, in option B, which is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure would have a formamide group (HCONH- attached to phenyl). The NH would be a singlet, but since it's only one H (as formamide has NH), but the integration is 2H, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps option D is more likely.

Now, the IR: the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably the carbonyl of the ester (since the 1720 is typical for esters; amides might be a bit lower, around 1650-1700). But wait, it depends on the substituents. So for an ester, O-CO-O-R, the carbonyl is around 1720-1750. So the 1720 cm^-1 supports an ester.

Looking at the NMR again: the quartet at 4.5 ppm and triplet at 1.20 ppm suggest an ethyl group attached to oxygen (OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's propyl. Wait, ethyl would be OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So yeah, that fits.

So putting this together:

- The 1.20 triplet (3H) is the CH3 of ethyl.
- The 4.5 quartet (2H) is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.
- The 4.0 singlet (2H) could be the NH2 group in the amine. Wait, but NH2 is usually a broad peak. So if it's an NH2, then 4.0 ppm is a bit low. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.

Wait, but in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzene with COOEt and NH2 groups para to each other. The aromatic protons would be the two doublets as observed.

In that case, the NH2 would be on the ring, so it's an aniline derivative. The NH2 protons in aniline are usually around 4-6 ppm, but they can vary. So the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm might fit as the NH2 group.

But wait, the integration is 2H. So in aniline, the NH2 is two protons. So that makes sense. So the 4.0 ppm is the NH2.

So the 1H NMR would have:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethyl CH3
- 4.0 (bs, 2H): NH2
- 4.5 (q, 2H): OCH2 of the ester
- Aromatic protons: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H)

Now, the IR has a strong band at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely the N-H stretches of the amine. The broadness would suggest hydrogen bonding, which is common in amines and amides. The 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl.

So looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits all this data.

Wait, but let's double-check the other options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would have an ethoxy group and an amide group on benzene. So the IR would show N-H stretches (amide) and an ester or amide carbonyl. The NMR would have the ethoxy group as a triplet and quartet, which it does. The aromatic protons would be more complex because of the substituents. But wait, the IR would have the amide's carbonyl, which is lower than an ester, maybe around 1650 cm-1. But the IR here is 1720, which suggests ester or maybe an acylated amide (but more likely ester). So option A might not fit the IR.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide would have a carbonyl maybe around 1680 cm-1. The IR here is 1720, which is higher, more like an ester. So this might not fit. Plus, the formamide's NH would be a triplet or something else, perhaps, but the integration is 2H which doesn't fit formamide's NH (which would be 1H). So option B seems less likely.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the NMR would have a triplet around 1.2 (CH3CH2), quartet around 4.5 (OCH2), and a triplet around 4.0 (the OCH2 adjacent). Wait, but the given data has 4.0 as a singlet, which doesn't fit. Also, the ethyl propionate would have more methylene groups, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a single CH2. But perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: the structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to benzene with NH2 at 4. The NMR would have the OCH2 group as a quartet (if ethyl, but propionate is longer), but the given data has 4.5 as a quartet (2H), which might fit a CH2 group. But the 4.0 as a singlet doesn't fit, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 is an NH2, but in option C, the NH2 is on the benzene, so the 4.0 ppm would be the NH2. But the 1720 in IR would suggest an ester, which option C has (propionate is a carboxylic acid ester), so that fits. But the substituents on the benzene would be NH2 at 4 and the ester group at another position. Wait, but the aromatic protons would be more like in option D.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back. The aromatic protons in the NMR are two doublets. In option D, it's para-substituted with COOEt and NH2, so the aromatic protons would be at 7 and 8 ppm as doublets. That fits.

In option C, the substituents would be the NH2 and the propionate group on the benzene ring. Let's say, for example, the propionate is attached at position 1 and the NH2 at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be ortho to propionate (positions 2 and 6) and para to NH2 (positions 3 and 5). But in that case, the protons ortho to propionate would be deshielded (downfield), maybe around 8 ppm, and the protons ortho to NH2 would be more shielded, around 7 ppm.

So the NMR would have doublets at 7 and 8 ppm, which is what's observed. So option C could also fit.

But looking at the NMR data again: the quartet in option C would be from the OCH2 of the propionate ester. So the propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So the OCH2 would be next to CH2CH3. Wait, no, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the structure would be OCH2CH2CH3? No, propyl is three carbons. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would be OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propyl is CH2CH2CH3, so propionate is OCH2CH2CH2COO-?

Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO- as the acid, so the ester would be R-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Its ester would be R-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait no, wait: propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So propionate ester would be, for example, CH3CH2COO-R, where R is ethyl or something else. So the structure would have a CH2CH2 group attached to the ester oxygen.

So in the NMR, the propionate ester would have the OCH2CH2CH3 group. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (since attached to CH2CH3), but the CH2CH3 would have a triplet. So in the NMR, the quartet would be at around 4.0-4.5 ppm, and the triplet would be around 1.2 ppm. But looking at the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), and the triplet is at 1.20 (3H). Wait, that fits a propyl group. So OCH2 (quartet) and CH2CH3 (triplet). So in option C, the structure would have the propionate ester: OCH2CH2CH3. So the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2, and the triplet at 1.2 would be the terminal CH3.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm peak is a singlet of 2H. That doesn't fit with propionate. Because propionate's OCH2 would be a quartet. So maybe that's not matching.

Alternatively, in option D, the OCH2 is part of the ethyl ester. So the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2, and the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3. Then the 4.0 ppm would be the NH2, which is a singlet because it's not split by any neighboring H's (since it's on the benzene ring, perhaps). But wait, NH2 groups are usually broad, but their integration is 2H. So that fits.

So, putting this together:

- Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. 
- NMR: 
  - 1.20 (t, 3H) → CH3 of ethyl ester.
  - 4.5 (q, 2H) → OCH2 of ethyl ester.
  - 4.0 (bs, 2H) → NH2 group.
  - Aromatic: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H) → protons ortho to NH2 and COOEt.

This fits all the data.

The IR data also supports this, as the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is consistent with the ester carbonyl group. The N-H stretches in the IR (3420 and 3325) are from the amine group.

So the correct answer should be option D.


The compound to identify is C9H11NO2, and the spectroscopic data provided includes IR and 1H NMR. Here's the analysis:

### IR Data:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are strong bands consistent with N-H stretching, likely from an amine or amide group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong band indicative of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

### 1H NMR Data:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely from an NH2 group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of the OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Contains an ethoxy group and an amide group.
- The IR would show N-H stretches but the carbonyl of an amide typically appears around 1650 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an ester).
- The NMR would show a more complex aromatic pattern due to the meta substitution, which does not match the observed data.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Contains a formamide group and an ethoxy group.
- The IR would show N-H stretches but the carbonyl of a formamide typically appears around 1680 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹.
- The NMR would not show a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), as formamide has only one NH proton.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Contains a propionate ester and an amino group.
- The NMR would show a quartet for the OCH2 group of the propionate ester, but the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) matches an ethyl ester, not a propyl group.
- The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could correspond to the NH2 group, but the IR data does not strongly support a propionate ester.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Contains an ethyl ester and an amino group on a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The IR data aligns well: the 1720 cm⁻¹ band corresponds to the ester carbonyl, and the 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ bands correspond to N-H stretches of the amine.
- The NMR data fits:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: CH3 of the ethyl ester.
  - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: NH2 group.
  - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: OCH2 of the ethyl ester.
  - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons ortho to the NH2 and ester groups, respectively.
- **Accepted.**

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data is consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
