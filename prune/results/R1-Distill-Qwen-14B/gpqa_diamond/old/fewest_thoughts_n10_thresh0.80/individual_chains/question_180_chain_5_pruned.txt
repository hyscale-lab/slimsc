Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to consider kinetic energy or anything like that because they're either fixed or constrained. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The problem asks for the minimum energy of this system, and I need to calculate it in Joules, correct to three decimals. The options are A, B, C, D, with some values given.

Hmm, okay, so this is an electrostatics problem. Since all the charges are the same and the system is isolated, I think I need to calculate the potential energy due to the arrangement of these charges. Because energy is a state function, the minimum energy would probably be the potential energy when the system is in its most stable configuration.

Wait, but how do I approach calculating the potential energy for a system of charges? I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble those charges from being infinitely far apart to their current positions. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But in this case, there are multiple charges. So for multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, the way it's worded, 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged in a sphere (or perhaps a circle) around it, each at a distance of 2 meters.

So, the setup is like a central charge with 12 others around it, each at 2 m. So the potential energy comes from two contributions: the energy due to the central charge interacting with each of the 12, and the energy due to the interactions among the 12 themselves.

Wait, but the
