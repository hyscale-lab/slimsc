Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm. Parallax is a measure of distance, right? Because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance.

Wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So we're looking for the relationship between N and r (distance). But the given relationship is between N and parallax, so we'll need to convert that into a function of distance.

Let me rephrase the given relation. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5.

Wait, no. Let me check that. If plx = 1/d, then (plx)^5 = (1/d)^5. So 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5? But wait, does that make sense? Because the number of stars would increase with distance? That seems off because when you look farther away, you can see more stars, but there's also the issue of volume.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a region could be related to the volume of a spherical shell at a distance r. The volume of a spherical shell with radius r and thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in such a shell would be proportional to the volume, right? But in this case, the relation given is different.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is the same as N ∝ (d)^5. So why is the number of stars increasing with the fifth power of distance? That seems really high, but maybe it's a specific scenario.

But wait, I'm getting confused because I thought the number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on how many stars are there per unit volume, and that might be a factor. But the question is about the number of stars in a region, and how that number changes with distance. So perhaps the number of stars is a function of how many are within a certain distance range. Or is it per unit distance?

Wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So it's the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm. So considering a small shell at distance r with a small thickness dr. The number of stars in that shell would be N = k * (4πr² dr) * (number density of stars).

But the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this step by step.

So, given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So d^5 would mean that as r increases, the number of stars in that shell increases rapidly. But that seems counterintuitive because when you look further away, each shell is larger in volume, but you might have fewer stars per unit volume.

Wait, perhaps the number density of stars (stars per unit volume) isn't constant. Maybe in this scenario, the number density increases with distance? That could be possible if, say, the galaxy's density structure is such that more stars are present at larger distances. But that's a very specific condition, which is probably not the case in reality, but since it's the question's scenario, I have to go with that.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number of stars per unit distance. So as r increases, the number of stars per unit r would be N = something * r^something.

Wait, let me think about how N changes with r. If N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, N increases rapidly. But the question is about how the number changes 'per unit range of distance, r.' Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting that part.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So if you have a certain region of the sky, the number of stars N in that region depends on the distance. When you look closer (smaller r), you can see more nearby stars, but when you look further away (larger r), each shell has a larger volume.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is roughly 4πr² dr multiplied by the number density of stars, n. So N = n * 4πr² dr. So if n is constant, then N is proportional to r² dr. But in our case, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe in this scenario, the number density of stars is increasing with distance. Because if N ∝ d^5, but from the shell model, N would be n * 4πr² dr, so n must be varying. Let me see: if N ∝ r^5, then substituting N = n * 4π r² dr,

n * r^2 dr = k r^5.

So n dr = k r^3 dr.

Hmm, this suggests that n ∝ r^3. So the number density of stars would be increasing with the cube of the distance. That's a very high increase. But perhaps that's what the question is assuming.

Wait, but the question's given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars in the region (per unit distance?) is proportional to r^5? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So for a given parallax (i.e., a given distance), the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5. Which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But the question is: how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance, r? So perhaps they're considering the number of stars in a small range of distances, like between r and r+dr.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the relation in terms of distance. Since N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, N = k (d)^5. So when you move to a larger distance, the number of stars increases as the fifth power. So per unit change in distance, the number of stars increases by r^5. So the answer would be option B, which is ~ r^5.

Wait, but wait. The number of stars in a region is a function of the volume. Volume increases with r^3, but if the number density increases with r^something, then it might not be directly r^3. But according to the problem statement, the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So regardless of the underlying reasoning, the mathematical relation is N ∝ d^5.

So the correct answer should be option B, which is ~ r^5.

Wait, but to make sure, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So N ∝ 1/(plx^5) = d^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Therefore, the answer is B.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where \( \text{plx} \) is the parallax. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \)), we can rewrite the relationship in terms of distance \( d \) as \( N \propto d^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). Substituting \( d = r \), the relationship becomes \( N \propto r^5 \). This means that the number of stars in the region increases rapidly with distance, following a fifth-power dependence. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
