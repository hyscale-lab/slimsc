Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this enthalpy of neutralization problem. Hmm, let me see. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, the problem gives me three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh, right, I think when you mix acids and bases, they neutralize each other. But wait, since there are three solutions here, I need to figure out how they all react together.

First, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because the neutralization depends on the mole ratio of H+ and OH- ions.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- (or wait, no, wait. Wait, H2SO4 first dissociates into H+ and HSO4^- and the second dissociation is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So I need to find the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, the neutralization will occur based on which is in excess.

Let me compute each solution's moles.

First, HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 liters. Concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 liters. 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each gives two H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

For Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 liters. 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives two OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Now total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH-: 0.2 moles.

Wait, so H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. All the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.
