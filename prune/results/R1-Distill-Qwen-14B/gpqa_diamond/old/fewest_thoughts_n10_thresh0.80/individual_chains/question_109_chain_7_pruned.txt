Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So when the system emits X, the final state must satisfy this condition.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on angular momentum and parity conservation.

The options are all transitions from 1S0 to other states plus a particle (p, etc.). Let me parse each option.

First, the initial state is 1S0. So let's write that in terms of quantum numbers. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, 1 indicates 2S+1 =1 → S=0. So S=0. The L is S, so L=0? Wait, no. The term is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. Because J = L + S, so 0 + 0 =0.

So initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When the system emits X, the process is NN → NN' + X. But wait, the problem says the final state is the NN state, which is the same as the initial in terms of being a bound system. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps it's more about the decay process, where the NN emits X, perhaps becoming another state.

Wait, the problem states that the NN system emits a particle X. So, the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state, plus X. So the NN' is the state after emission.

But in the options, the initial is 1S0, and the final states are like 7D1, etc. So each option is a transition from 1S0 to some state (like 7D1) plus a particle.

Wait, each option is of the form 1S0 → [some state] + [particle]. So the initial state is the NN system in 1S0, and it emits X, resulting in a new NN state and X.

So the problem is about the allowed transitions, considering conservation laws.

First, let's think about parity. Parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The initial parity would be the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles. But wait, in the initial state, it's a bound NN system. But what's the parity of a nucleon? Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a parity of +1. Wait, no, the parity of the nucleus or the system? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the parity of the two-nucleon system.

Wait, the parity of the NN system is given by (-1)^L, because parity for orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. But for two identical fermions, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. So the spin, spatial, and any other quantum numbers must combine to make the total wavefunction antisymmetric.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state is 1S0. Which means S=0, L=0, J=0. So the parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.

Now, when the system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So, the parity of the final state must be considered.

Parity is conserved in strong interactions (like in this case, since it's a bound state emitting a pion or similar), so the parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X.

So initial parity is P_initial = (+1) because 1S0 has L=0, so (-1)^0=1.

The final state is NN' (some state) plus X. So the parity of the final state is P_final = P_NN' * P_X.

So P_initial = P_NN' * P_X.

P_initial is +1. P_X is given as -1. So,

+1 = P_NN' * (-1)

So P_NN' = -1.

Because 1 = P_NN' * (-1) → P_NN' = -1.

So the final NN' state must have parity -1.

The parity of the NN' state is given by (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final state. So (-1)^{L'} = -1 → L' must be odd.

So L' is an odd integer. So for the possible options, the final state's L must be odd.

Looking at the options, the final state is given as, for example, 7D1. The D state has L=2, which is even. So D is L=2. So that's even. So if the parity is (-1)^2 = +1, but we need P_NN' = -1, so L' must be odd.

Wait, let me go through each option's final state's L value.

Option A: 7D1. D → L=2. So (-1)^2 = +1. But we need P_NN'=-1. So this would violate parity. So this option can't be allowed?

Wait no, wait. Wait, the parity of the final state is P_NN' = (-1)^{L'}, which must be -1. So L' must be odd. So if the emitted particle X has parity -1, and the initial state has parity +1, then the final state must have parity -1, which requires L' being odd.

So any option where the final state's orbital angular momentum L' is even would result in P_NN' = +1, which would make the product +1, but the initial parity is +1. So that would require X to have parity +1, but X has parity -1. So this would violate parity conservation. Thus, any option where the final state's orbital L is even would be invalid.

So let me check each option:

Option A: 7D1. D is L=2, which is even. So P_NN' = (-1)^2 = +1. Then P_NN' * P_X = (+1)*(-1) = -1. But initial P_initial is +1. So this would imply +1 = -1, which is impossible. So option A is not allowed.

Option B:
