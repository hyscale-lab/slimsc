Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, which relates to their area via the formula S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area. Right, that's the formula. So I need to find the entropy, which depends on the area of the event horizon.

Wait, the problem gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh right, angular size! So I think I can find the actual size of the event horizon using some trigonometry. Since θ is given in degrees, I should convert that to radians because most formulas use radians. Oh, right, because the conversion is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). So θ is 1e-17 degrees, which is 1e-17 * π/180 radians.

But wait, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ diameter / distance, assuming small angles where sine and tangent are approximately equal. Oh yeah, because when θ is very small (which it is here, 1e-17 degrees is tiny), so we can approximate θ ≈ (2R)/(d), where R is the radius of the event horizon. Wait, actually, the diameter is 2R, so θ ≈ (2R)/d. So, solving for R: R = (d θ) / 2.

Wait, but R is the Schwarzschild radius, right? The Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by 2G M / c². So if I can find R_s, I can find the mass M. Then, knowing the area A, which is 4π R_s², I can compute the entropy.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the area A directly from the angular size and distance. Let's see. The angular size θ is 2R/(d), so R = d θ / 2. Then the area A would be 4 π R² = 4 π (d θ / 2)^2 = π d² θ². Wait, that seems simpler. So A = π d² θ².

Wait, but wait. Because when we're dealing with angles, sometimes we use θ in radians as the ratio d/D, where D is the distance. So for small angles, θ ≈ R / D, but wait, no, that's when R is the size and D is the distance, then θ ≈ R/D. But in this case, the event horizon diameter is 2 R_s, so the size is 2 R_s. So θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d. So R_s = (d θ) / 2 * 1 rad. Wait, am I getting this right?

Let me think again. For small angles, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the ratio of the opposite side (which would be the size of the object) over the adjacent side (distance). So θ ≈ size / distance. But since the event horizon is a sphere, the size we're considering is the diameter, which is 2 R_s. So θ ≈ (2 R_s)/(d). So R_s = (d θ) / 2.

Wait, but wait, no, θ is in radians, so yes, that's the formula. So R_s = (d * θ) / 2, where θ is in radians.

So let's compute R_s. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, I need to convert parsecs to meters because the standard units for black hole formulas are in meters, kilograms, seconds, etc. Oh right, 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let's convert that to radians. θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So R_s = (3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad) / 2. Let me compute that: 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 ≈ (3.086 * 1.745) e^(26-19) → 3.086 * 1.745 is about 5.37, so 5.37e7 meters. Divided by 2, R_s ≈ 2.685e7 meters.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit off. Because supermassive black holes have Schwarzschild radii on the order of millions of kilometers. Wait, 2.685e7 meters is about 26,850 kilometers. Hmm, that seems plausible for a supermassive black hole? I thought they were larger. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers. 1e10 parsecs is 10 billion parsecs. Wait, that's a very large distance. But a 1e-17-degree angle is extremely small, so the object must be very far away. But for a galaxy, that's a typical distance. Wait, but wait, the galaxy is at 1e10 parsecs? That's about 3.28e10 light-years, which is much beyond our local universe. But perhaps the problem states that, so I have to go with that.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me re-calculate R_s.

d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m.

θ_deg = 1e-17 → θ_rad = 1e-17 * π /180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So R_s = (d * θ_rad)/2 = (3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19) / 2.

Multiplying 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19: 3.086 * 1.745 ≈ 5.37, and 1e26 * 1e-19 = 1e7. So 5.37e7 m. Divided by 2, R_s ≈ 2.685e7 m, which is about 2.685e4 kilometers. Wait, 2.685e7 meters is 26,850 kilometers. Hmm, that's about 26 million kilometers. Wait, a Schwarzschild radius of 26 million km? Let me think: the Sun's Schwarzschild radius is about 3 km, and a supermassive black hole could have millions of times that. 26 million km would correspond to a mass of (R_s c²)/(2 G). Wait, maybe I should compute the mass to see if that makes sense.

Wait, Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c². So M = (R_s c²) / (2 G). Let me compute M.

R_s = 2.685e7 m.

c = 3e8 m/s.

G = 6.674e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

So M = (2.685e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2) / (2 * 6.674e-11)

Compute numerator: 2.685e7 * (9e16) = 2.685e7 *9e16 = 24.165e23 = 2.4165e24.

Denominator: 2*6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10.

So M = (2.4165e24) / (1.3348e-10) = 2.4165e24 / 1.3348e-10 ≈ 1.81e34 kg.

Wait, 1e34 kg is a lot. The mass of the Sun is about 2e30 kg. So 1.8e34 kg is 900 times the mass of the Sun. Hmm, but supermassive black holes are millions to billions of solar masses. Wait, but 1.8e34 kg is 1.8e34 / 2e30 ≈ 9e3 solar masses. That's 9,000 solar masses. That doesn't seem supermassive, but perhaps I made a mistake in the R_s calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of R_s. Let me recheck:

R_s = (d * θ_rad) / 2.

d = 3.086e26 m.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So d * θ_rad = 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = let's compute that.

3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = 3.086 * 1.745 = 5.37, and 1e26 *1e-19 = 1e7. So 5.37e7 m. Divide by 2 gives R_s ≈ 2.685e7 m. So my earlier calculation was correct.

So M ≈ 1.8e34 kg = 9e3 solar masses. Hmm, that's about 10,000 solar masses. But supermassive black holes are like millions to billions. Oh, perhaps the distance given is 10^10 parsecs, which is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, that's 10 billion parsecs, which is way beyond the local universe, which is about 100 million light-years in diameter. So perhaps I should think about that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let's think differently. The area A is 4 π R_s². Once I have R_s, I can compute A, then plug into the entropy formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area A from the angular size and distance directly, without going through R_s.

Wait, because A is the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere. The angular diameter θ is θ ≈ diameter / distance. So diameter = 2 R_s. So θ = (2 R_s)/d. So R_s = (d θ)/2.

So A = 4 π R_s² = 4 π (d θ / 2)^2 = π d² θ².

Wait, that might be a better way to compute A.

So let's compute A = π d² θ².

d is 1e10 parsecs = 3.086e26 m.

θ in radians is 1.745e-19.

So A = π * (3.086e26)^2 * (1.745e-19)^2.

Compute each term:

(3.086e26)^2 = (3.086)^2 * (1e26)^2 = ~9.52e52.

(1.745e-19)^2 = (3.046e-38).

So A = π * 9.52e52 * 3.046e-38 ≈ π * 2.907e15.

π is about 3.1416, so A ≈ 9.13e15 m².

Wait, that seems very small. Because typical area for a supermassive black hole would be on the order of 1e30 m² or something, but wait, maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 3.086e26 squared is (3.086)^2 = ~9.52, and 1e26 squared is 1e52. So 9.52e52.

1.745e-19 squared is (1.745^2)= ~3.046e-38.

Multiply 9.52e52 *3.046e-38 = 9.52 *3.046 = ~29.05, and 1e52 *1e-38 =1e14. So 29.05e14 = 2.905e15.

Multiply by π: ~9.14e15 m².

Hmm, so A is about 9.14e15 m².

Wait, that's 9e15 m². Now, the entropy S is (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

Constants:

k = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = reduced Planck constant = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So plug in the numbers:

S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3e8 m/s)^3 * (9.14e15 m²) / (4 * 1.05457e-34 J s * 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator:

1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 * 9.14e15.

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25.

So 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = 1.38 * 2.7 = ~3.726e2. So 3.726e2 * 9.14e15.

3.726e2 = 372.6.

372.6 * 9.14e15 = 372.6 *9.14 = approx 3400, so 3400e15 =3.4e18.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 = 1.38e-23 * 27e24 = 1.38 *27 *1e( -23 +24 ) = 37.26 *1e1 = 372.6.

So 372.6 * 9.14e15 = 372.6 *9.14 = let's compute 372 *9.14.

372 *9 = 3348, 372 *0.14=52.08. So total 3348 +52.08=3400.08. So 3400.08e15 = 3.40008e18.

So numerator is 3.4e18 J m²/s, perhaps? Let me think.

Wait, units: (k has J/K) * c^3 (m³/s³) * A (m²) → (J/K) * m^3/s^3 * m^2 → J m^3/(K s^3). Hmm, but wait, maybe the units will cancel out in the end.

Denominator:

4 * ħ * G = 4 * 1.05457e-34 J s * 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

Multiply 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.05457 *6.6743) e(-34-11) → ~7.02e-45.

Multiply by 4: 4 *7.02e-45 = 2.808e-44.

So denominator is 2.808e-44 J m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻³.

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³/(kg s²).

So ħ G = 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = approx 7.02e-45 (J s * m³/(kg s²)) = 7.02e-45 m³ J/(kg s).

Wait, but J is kg m²/s². So substituting:

7.02e-45 m³ (kg m²/s²) / (kg s) ) → 7.02e-45 m^5/(s^3).

Hmm, but maybe units aren't the easiest way. Let's focus on the numerical value.

So denominator is 4 * ħ * G = 4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = 4 * (1.05457 *6.6743) * 1e-45.

Compute 1.05457 *6.6743: approximately 7.02.

So 4 *7.02 =28.08, so 28.08e-45 → 2.808e-44.

So denominator is 2.808e-44.

So S = numerator / denominator = 3.4e18 / 2.808e-44.

3.4e18 / 2.808e-44 = (3.4 /2.808) * 1e(18 +44) → approx 1.21 * 1e62 → 1.21e62 J/K.

So the entropy is about 1e62 J/K. Looking at the options, option A is 1e62. But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 3.4e18 / 2.8e-44 → 3.4e18 * 1e44 /2.8 → 3.4e(18+44) /2.8 = 3.4e62 /2.8 → approx 1.21e62.

So S≈1.2e62 J/K. So the order of magnitude is 1e62, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. When I calculated A, I think I might have missed a factor. Because when I computed A as π d^2 θ^2, I assumed θ is the angular diameter, so the size is 2 R_s. So A = 4 π R_s^2 = π (2 R_s)^2 (π * (d θ)^2 /4) → Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently.

Wait, the formula was A = π d² θ²? No, earlier, from θ= (2 R_s)/d → 2 R_s = d θ → R_s = (d θ)/2. So A =4 π R_s² =4 π (d θ/2)^2=4 π (d^2 θ^2/4 )= π d^2 θ^2. So that part was correct.

Wait, but in the calculation, I took A=~9e15 m², which when computing S gives me 1e62 J/K. That seems correct.

So the answer should be A) 1e62 J/K.


To determine the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the formula for entropy in terms of the area of the event horizon:

\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon. The area \(A\) can be calculated using the angular size \(\theta\) and the distance \(d\) to the black hole. For small angles, the angular size \(\theta\) (in radians) is related to the diameter of the event horizon \(2R_s\) by:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{2R_s}{d}
\]

Rearranging, the Schwarzschild radius \(R_s\) is:

\[
R_s = \frac{d \theta}{2}
\]

The area of the event horizon is then:

\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2 = 4 \pi \left(\frac{d \theta}{2}\right)^2 = \pi d^2 \theta^2
\]

### Step 1: Convert the given distance and angular size to SI units
- Distance: \(d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} = 10^{10} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}\)
- Angular size: \(\theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} = 10^{-17} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \, \text{radians} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}\)

### Step 2: Calculate the area \(A\)
Using the formula \(A = \pi d^2 \theta^2\):

\[
A = \pi \times (3.086 \times 10^{26})^2 \times (1.745 \times 10^{-19})^2
\]

First, compute \((3.086 \times 10^{26})^2\):

\[
(3.086)^2 \approx 9.52, \quad (10^{26})^2 = 10^{52}, \quad \text{so } (3.086 \times 10^{26})^2 \approx 9.52 \times 10^{52}
\]

Next, compute \((1.745 \times 10^{-19})^2\):

\[
(1.745)^2 \approx 3.046, \quad (10^{-19})^2 = 10^{-38}, \quad \text{so } (1.745 \times 10^{-19})^2 \approx 3.046 \times 10^{-38}
\]

Now multiply:

\[
A = \pi \times (9.52 \times 10^{52}) \times (3.046 \times 10^{-38}) \approx \pi \times 2.907 \times 10^{15} \approx 9.14 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy \(S\)
The entropy formula is:

\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]

Substitute the constants:
- \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)
- \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)
- \(A = 9.14 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2\)
- \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\)
- \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}\)

First, compute the numerator:

\[
k c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times (3 \times 10^8)^3 \times (9.14 \times 10^{15})
\]

\[
(3 \times 10^8)^3 = 27 \times 10^{24} = 2.7 \times 10^{25}
\]

\[
k c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \times (9.14 \times 10^{15}) \approx 3.4 \times 10^{18} \, \text{J m}^2/\text{s}^3
\]

Next, compute the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \times (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.6743 \times 10^{-11})
\]

\[
(1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 7.02 \times 10^{-45}
\]

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \times 7.02 \times 10^{-45} \approx 2.808 \times 10^{-44}
\]

Finally, divide numerator by denominator:

\[
S = \frac{3.4 \times 10^{18}}{2.808 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 1.21 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the order of magnitude
The entropy is approximately \(1.21 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\), so the order of magnitude is \(10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\).

### Final Answer:
The entropy of the black hole is closest to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
