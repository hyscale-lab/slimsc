Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, first things first. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <A> = ψ* A ψ, where ψ is the state vector, and A is the operator. Oh right, and for spin, the operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, I think. So σ_y would be the Pauli Y matrix.

The Pauli Y matrix is given as:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]
So σ_y is that matrix. But S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by this σ_y matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The state vector is given as (3i, 4). Let me write that as a column vector: 
ψ = [3i; 4]. So ψ is a two-component vector.

Wait, the expectation value is <S_y> = ψ† S_y ψ. Because the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the operator acting on the state.

So let me compute that step by step.

First, let's write down ψ. ψ is [3i, 4]^T. Its conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3, 4* ] because 3i's conjugate is -3. Wait, wait, 3i is in
