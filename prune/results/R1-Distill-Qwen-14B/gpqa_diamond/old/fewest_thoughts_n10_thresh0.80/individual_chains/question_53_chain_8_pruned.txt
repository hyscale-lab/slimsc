Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so I'm thinking ester functional group is present. The 1H NMR has six signals: two for aromatic-H, two for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals, so no methylene groups. The options are four different chemical formulas.

Hmm. So the compound is an ester, probably something like an aryl ester or maybe a substituted one. Since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, it's probably benzene or a derivative. Di-substituted means two substituents on the ring.

Let me break down the NMR signals.

1. Aromatic protons: two signals. That suggests that the two substituents are in such a position that the ring's protons are split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be two sets of two each (like two doublets), but wait, the aromatic signals are two in number. Wait, the question says two signals for aromatic-H, each perhaps as a singlet? Or maybe each a doublet or something else. Wait, the problem states "two signals corresponding to aromatic-H", so maybe each is a doublet or something else. Alternatively, maybe two different types of aromatic protons. Like, perhaps a meta-substituted situation? Or maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is something else, causing the aromatic protons to split into two sets.

Wait, the FTIR shows an ester group. So the substituents must include an ester. Let's think: an ester group is usually something like R-O-C-O-R', but in the context of a benzene ring, perhaps it's a benzene ring with an ester substituent, like a benzoyl ester or something. But wait, the ring is substituted twice, so another group is present.

Wait, what's a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and another substituent? Maybe one substituent is an ester (like an OAc group, but that's a ketone maybe). Or perhaps it's an ester like O-R where R is another group. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and another is a vinyl group. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is something like methyl vinyl benzoate or similar.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests a vinyl group attached, perhaps as a substituent on the ring. Vinyl groups have protons that are next to a double bond, so that would show up as a triplet or something else. Wait, vinyl protons are typically split into doublets because each proton is adjacent to another on the double bond. But in some cases, coupling with other protons can cause more splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester. Wait, if it's an ester, maybe it's like an acetylenic
