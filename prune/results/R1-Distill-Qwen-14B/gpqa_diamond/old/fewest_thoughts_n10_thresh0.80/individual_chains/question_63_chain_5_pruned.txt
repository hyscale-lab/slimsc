Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about what photon momentum is needed for the molecule to move to the next lowest energy state when it's in its fundamental state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So the next state should be the first excited state. But wait, I need to clarify whether the problem is about rotation, vibration, or both. Because the quantum rotation-vibration model considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

I remember that in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are different from the rigid rotor because the bond length isn't fixed. But maybe for this problem, I can treat it as a rigid rotor first? Or perhaps the vibration is a separate consideration.

Wait, the question is about a photon being absorbed, which would cause a transition. In molecular spectroscopy, absorption of a photon usually corresponds to a transition between vibrational or rotational energy levels. But in this case, since it's the rotation-vibration model, perhaps the transition involves both vibrations and rotations.

But wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's considering transitions within the vibrational levels, but the next state would be the next vibrational state, and within that, the lowest rotational state. Or perhaps it's the next energy level overall, which could be a combination.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to a higher energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next vibrational state (v=1) with the lowest rotational state (J=0), or maybe a change in rotation within the same vibrational level.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational. The total energy is the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state could involve increasing either v or J.

But the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and it's absorbing
