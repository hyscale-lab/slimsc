Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, the state vector is the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So I should check if this state is normalized. Let me calculate the norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector should be normalized, so I think I'll have to divide each component by sqrt(6). So the state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. I'll keep that in mind.

The operators for P and Q are given. Let's look at P first. The matrix for P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, what's the structure of this matrix? It looks like it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

And Q's matrix is:

Q = [
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

So Q is a diagonal matrix, which probably means its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. Wait, no, because the diagonal elements are 1, 0, -1. So yes, the eigenvalues are 1,0,-1, with the corresponding eigenvectors being the standard basis vectors.

The question is about measuring P and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but when you measure P and then Q, the state after measuring P will collapse into an eigenstate of P. So the process is: first measure P, get 0, then measure Q on the resulting state, get -1. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 in P and then, given that, the probability of getting -1 in Q.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the joint probability of measuring P=0 and Q=-1 in the respective measurements, considering that after P is measured, the state collapses, so Q is measured on the new state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the combined measurement, but since P and Q don't commute, their measurements are not simultaneous. So the correct approach is to first measure P, then measure Q on the new state.

So let's break it down
