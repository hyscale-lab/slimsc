Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the product of a reaction involving Compound X. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage of alkenes, but wait, that's when there's an alkene present. So, maybe Compound X has a double bond somewhere.

Let me look at the spectral data provided to figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data will help me determine the structure.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, probably indicating O-H stretching or maybe an amine. But wait, the presence of a strong peak around 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, there's definitely an aromatic ring in the molecule.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, no, because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a broad peak might indicate exchange or an acidic proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton since those are also around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which could also be a carboxylic acid (since their carbonyls are around 1700-1725). So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone. Hmm.

Let me list out the NMR signals:

1. 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. Could be an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.
2. 8.0 ppm, d, 2H: Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. For example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, two doublets.
3. 7.2 ppm, d, 2H: Same as above, perhaps the other two aromatic protons.
4. 2.9 ppm, m, 1H: This could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe a ketone or ester oxygen. Or perhaps a CH in a branched chain.
5. 1.7 ppm, m, 2H: Maybe another CH2 group, perhaps next to a branching point.
6. 1.4 ppm, d, 3H: A methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH(CH3) group, as in an isobutyl or something similar.
7. 0.9 ppm, t, 3H: A terminal methyl group, like at the end of a chain, maybe a propyl group.

Putting this together. The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's say positions 1 and 4 (if we number them 1,2,3,4). So maybe substituents at positions 1 and 4.

The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid. If that's the case, then the substituents are a carboxylic acid group and another group on the benzene ring.

Looking at the other signals: the 2.9 ppm m (1H) could be adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, maybe the structure is something like benzene with a side chain that includes a carbonyl group.

Let me think of a possible structure. Maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group connected to a chain.

Wait, the 1H N
