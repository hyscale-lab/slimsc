Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about two different reactions, A and B, and I need to pick the correct major products from the options given. 

First, let's break down the problem. The question describes the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically involves 1,5-dienes, right? So when a 1,5-diene undergoes Cope rearrangement, it forms another 1,5-diene but with the positions of the double bonds shifted.

Looking at the first reaction, the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxy group (O) attached to a methyl group, and that methyl is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Breaking that down, the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is a four-carbon chain where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and there's a methyl group on C3.

So the structure looks like benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, actually, no. Wait, but 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, but that would be 1-pentene or something else. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Maybe I should write it out.

But-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH
