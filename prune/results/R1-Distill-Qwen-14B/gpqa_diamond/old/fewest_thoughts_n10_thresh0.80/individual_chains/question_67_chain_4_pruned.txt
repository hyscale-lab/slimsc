Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, you have the total l and m. So l1 and l2 are 1 each, so the possible total l values range from l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. So 1+1=2, down to 0. So l can be 2, 1, or 0. In this case, the state is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. So the total orbital angular momentum is l=2, and the z-component is m=-1.

The question asks about measuring the individual Lz components of each electron, L1z and L2z. The possible eigenvalues for each Lz are mℏ, where m can be -1, 0, +1 for l=1.

We are to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues -ℏ each. So the measurement outcomes would be m1=-1 and m2=-1.

Wait, but how do these relate to the coupled state? Because the coupled state is a combination of the product states of the individual states.

I think I need to express the given coupled state in terms of the product states of each electron's individual states. Because then, I can find the amplitude (and thus probability) of getting m1=-1 and m2=-1.

The given state is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me think about how to expand this. The total state is a combination of states where each electron has their own m1 and m2, and the total m is m1 + m2. So for the coupled state, m = m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, the coupled state is already given as |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So when we expand this, it will be a linear combination of |m1, m2> states, such that m1 + m2 = M = -1.

But wait, the product state is |m1> ⊗ |m2>, and the coupled state is a sum over these, weighted by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan expansion.

So the expansion would look like: |1,1,2,-1> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1,
