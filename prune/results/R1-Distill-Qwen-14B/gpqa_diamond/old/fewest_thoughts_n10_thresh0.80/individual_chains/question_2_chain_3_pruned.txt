Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through each part carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. The process goes through three steps, and we need to find out the number of carbon atoms in the final product, product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

First, I'll break down each reaction.

Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide to form product 1. Hmm. I remember that Grignard reagents like methyl magnesium bromide typically add to carbonyl groups. Cinnamaldehyde has a carbonyl group, so the Grignard would attack there. 

Trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached. Its structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is more like Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde where the aldehyde group is attached to a double bond. Oh right, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait. No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Its structure is benzene ring connected to a propenal group. So, it's benzaldehyde with the CH2 group replaced by a double bond. Oh wait, no. Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So structure is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait. No, wait, it's Ph-CH2-CHO? No. Wait, propenal is CH2=CHCHO, but cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO? Hmm, maybe I should draw it. No, wait. Okay, cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached via a CH₂ group, but I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH₂-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH₂-CHO?

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH₂-CHO. But I think I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's
