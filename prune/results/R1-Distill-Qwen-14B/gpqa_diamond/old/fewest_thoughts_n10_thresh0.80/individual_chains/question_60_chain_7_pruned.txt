Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation effects come into play. So the astronaut's own time would be different from the time experienced by someone on Earth.

Let me read the question again. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is extremely close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip would take from their perspective.

Wait, the problem says "from the point of view of the astronaut." So we're dealing with the proper time here. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference, which is the astronaut's frame. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the journey.

But wait, what do I know about the distance? Oh, right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy, so the distance between it and Earth is quite large. Wait, the exact distance isn't given, but maybe I can figure it out or find a way to express the time without needing the exact distance.

Wait, no, the question gives the astronaut's age as 22, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Oh, wait, the average lifetime is 150 solar years for the aliens. Hmm, but if the astronaut is 22, and their lifespan is 150, then even without considering relativity, they'd have plenty of time. But because of relativity, maybe their experienced time is less, so perhaps they won't live long enough? Or wait, maybe the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is less, so maybe the trip takes a shorter time than 150 years, so they'll make it.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Let's break it down.

First, I need to calculate the proper time τ (tau) experienced by the astronaut. The proper time is given by the equation:

τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

But wait, that's when t is the time measured in Earth's frame, and v is the speed. Alternatively, since the astronaut is moving, the Earth and the journey's distance would be Lorentz contracted from their perspective. So the distance is contracted, and the
