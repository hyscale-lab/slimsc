Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are A, B, C, D, and I need to figure out which one matches.

So the given data:

Mass Spec: Molecular ion at m/z 156 (100%), and another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, I remember that the molecular ion is the peak at the molecular weight. So the molecular weight is 156. The other peak at 158 is 32%, which is a common abundance. Wait, maybe it's an isotope? Like chlorine has a common isotope at about 35Cl, which would add 3 to the mass. So 156 could be the base peak (M), and 158 would be M+2 (since Cl is about 35, so M + 2 would be from Cl and another?) Hmm, maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

IR data: Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That broad region is usually O-H stretch. But wait, a broad peak could mean something like a carboxylic acid (which is usually a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3500), but wait, the range given is 3500 to 2700. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol or maybe an aldehyde O-H, but aldehydes have a different O-H (like in ald. acid, which is usually a strong, sharp peak in IR?), but the peak here is broad. Wait, but wait, the peak is strong and sharp at 1720 cm^-1. 1720 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have O-H stretches too. Wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720 suggests maybe an ester or maybe a ketone? Or perhaps an aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes have strong absorption around 1700-1750, but sometimes a bit higher. Alternatively, carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700, but they usually have a broad O-H around 2500-3300. Wait, the IR here shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. Hmm, that's a pretty broad region but maybe it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid, but the carbonyl is at 1720. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 2500-3300, but the data here is 3500-2700, which is a lower range. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Another thought: maybe it's an alcohol, but the 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the NMR data:

Protons NMR:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a really high chemical shift. I know that aldehydes have protons around 9-10 ppm, but something higher would be... Wait, maybe a carboxylic acid O-H? Wait, the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually around 10-12 ppm, but as a broad peak. But here, the integration is 1H, and the multiplicity is a singlet. So maybe it's a phenolic OH, but those are usually around 5-7 ppm, or maybe an aldehyde proton. Wait wait, wait, no. The aldehyde proton is usually a triplet or something else, but more importantly, in the 9-10 ppm range. Wait, the 11.0 ppm is even higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid O-H (but those are usually broader), but why is it a singlet? Maybe it's not O-H. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde with some deshielding.

Wait, but another possibility: what about a carbonyl group that's not a carbonyl proton? Hmm, maybe the 11 ppm is a carbonyl oxygen, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic proton. Wait, no, aromatic protons are usually lower. Another thought: maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenol, but again, phenols are lower. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring, but again, phenols are usually around 5-7 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals:

8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets each with 2H. So it's likely a benzene ring with substituents in para positions. Like two substituents opposite each other, leading to a doublet for each pair.

Putting that together: the benzene ring has substituents in para positions. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzoic acid or something similar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with OH in position 2 and Cl in 3. So substituents are ortho and meta, so the ring wouldn't be para-substituted. That might lead to different NMR patterns.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would be Cl and COOH groups in the para positions. So the ring has Cl and COOH opposite each other. In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H. That fits with the 8.02 and 7.72 ppm signals. Also, the 11.0 ppm singlet could be the COOH O-H.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be ClCO-O-Ph. So the carbonyl would be an ester. The NMR would have the aromatic protons in the 7-8 ppm range, and perhaps an ester group. But where would the O-Cl be? Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. But I'm not sure about the NMR here.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So Cl and COOH groups are in the ortho positions. That would cause the aromatic protons to be in a different pattern. Maybe a triplet or something else, but the NMR shows two separate doublets, which suggests para substitution.

So going back to the IR: strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. If that's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is also around 1720. Wait, but the IR also has a broad peak from 3500-2700. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is broad around 2500-3300. But here the peak is 3500-2700, which is a bit higher. Wait, maybe it's a different type of O-H, like an alcohol. But then why the strong carbonyl?

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion is at m/z 156. Let's calculate the molecular formula. Let's think about the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight:

C:7 *12=84
H:5 *1=5
Cl:35.5 (approx 35)
O:2 *16=32
Total: 84+5=89 +35=124 +32=156. So molecular weight is 156. So that fits with the molecular ion at 156.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same molecular formula: C7H5ClO2. Same molecular weight.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2? Wait, let me compute. Benzene ring (6 C) + Cl, COO (another 2 C and O2) and a Cl and O. Wait, phenyl chloroformate would be C6H5-O-CO-Cl. So the formula is C8 H5 Cl O2. Wait, 6 C from benzene, 2 C from O-CO-Cl. So total C8. H: benzene has 5 H (since one O is attached, so perhaps 5 H?), but not sure. Let me compute the molecular weight: C8: 8*12=96, H5:5, Cl:35.5, O2:32. Total=96+5=101 +35.5=136.5 +32=168.5. So molecular ion would be around 169, but the given is 156, so that doesn't fit. So option C is probably not.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Formula would be C7 H5 Cl O2. Wait, because benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but with substituents. Let me compute:

Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) is C7 H6 O. So adding Cl and OH? Wait, no, the formula for 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would be C7 H5 Cl O2. Because the benzaldehyde is C7 H6 O, but substituting with Cl and OH would replace some H's, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compute the molecular weight.

C:7 *12=84
H:5 *1=5
Cl:35.5
O:2 *16=32
Total:84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular weight is approximately 156.5, which is about 156. So that fits.

But then, looking at NMR: the 11 ppm would be the aldehyde proton? Wait, no, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, and they usually show up as a singlet. But this is 11.0 ppm. Hmm. Also, in the case of an aldehyde, the IR would show a strong peak around 1700, which it does (1720). But the broad peak in IR is 3500-2700. Oh wait, the -OH from the hydroxyl group would be in that region. But a phenol OH is usually around 5-7 ppm in NMR, but in this case, the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe that's not the case.

So, back to the options. Option B and D have the same molecular formula and molecular weight. So they fit the mass spec.

Looking at the NMR again: the aromatic protons are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that suggests a para-substituted ring. So in option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has a Cl and COOH in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's consistent.

In option D, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents (Cl and COOH) are in the ortho positions. So the aromatic Hs would not be two doublets each of 2H. Instead, perhaps more complex splitting, maybe a triplet or something else. So the NMR data seems to fit option B better.

IR: The strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. Benzoic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, so 1720 is a bit high. Alternatively, an ester would have a carbonyl around 1720, but benzoic acid's might be a bit lower, perhaps. Also, the O-H in benzoic acid would be a broad peak around 2500-3300, but the IR here is 3500-2700, which is a higher wavenumber. Wait, but the IR in the problem says a broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1. So that's a region that includes the O-H stretch. Benzoic acid's O-H is usually a broad peak that can sometimes go up to around 3000 cm^-1. So maybe this fits.

The NMR peak at 11 ppm as a singlet is probably the O-H of the carboxylic acid, which is deshielded and appears as a broad peak, but in the given data, it's a singlet. Wait, carboxylic O-H is usually a broad peak, not a sharp singlet. Hmm, but maybe in some cases, like if it's exchanging or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton like an aldehyde, but the aldehyde would have a different shift.

Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad. But in the given NMR, it's a singlet. That's a bit confusing. Could that be a mistake in the data? Or maybe the peak isn't O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton. But wait, the aldehyde shift is usually around 9-10 ppm. Here it's 11, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the peak at 11 ppm isn't O-H. Could it be something else? Like an NH group? But the options don't have amines. Or perhaps an acidic proton elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton, but that doesn't make sense because aromatic protons are lower. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 11 ppm is the O-H of a phenol. But in that case, the peak would be around 5-7 ppm, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a formate ester or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the structure is Cl and COOH in para positions on benzene. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR.

The O-H in the carboxylic acid would be a broad peak in IR, which the problem states as a broad peak in 3500-2700, which is correct.

The 1720 cm^-1 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Typically, it's about 1700. So maybe that's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the acid is deprotonated, but then the O-H wouldn't be present. But in the NMR, the 11 ppm would be the O-H, so it must be protonated.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of an ester. Let's think about option C, which is phenyl chloroformate. The structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph.

In that case, the IR would have a strong carbonyl (ester) around 1720 cm^-1, which matches. The O-Cl would have a peak around 800-850 cm^-1, which wasn't mentioned, but maybe it's not in the given data.

The NMR would have the aromatic protons. For phenyl chloroformate, the aromatic protons are usually a singlet if the substituents are para, but in this case, the substituents would be O-CO-Cl attached to benzene. Wait, benzene with O-CO-Cl group in para position. So the aromatic protons would be deshielded, but the splitting would depend on substitution. Wait, for para substitution, the aromatic protons would be two doublets each of 2H, same as the other options with para substituents.

Wait, but phenyl chloroformate would have the structure O-CO-Cl attached to the benzene. So the substituent is an ester group. The aromatic protons would be in the 7.5-8.5 range, which matches the given data.

The NMR's 11 ppm would be from where? In the case of chloroformate, there are no O-H groups. Oh wait, the 11 ppm could be an aliphatic proton. Wait, no, chloroformate doesn't have any protons except the aromatic ones. So perhaps in this case, the 11 ppm isn't present. But the data says there is a peak at 11.0 ppm, so option C probably doesn't fit.

So perhaps option B is better, despite the O-H being a singlet in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back, the NMR shows 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), which is a singlet, 8.02 (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that's three signals.

If it's benzoic acid (option B), then the aromatic ring has two substituents: Cl and COOH in para. The aromatic protons are in the two doublets. The 11 ppm would be the COOH O-H. But in the NMR, COOH O-H is usually a broad peak, but in the problem, it's a singlet. That's a point of confusion.

Wait, maybe the O-H is not present in the NMR because it's exchanged and not showing up as a peak. But the problem states there's a peak at 11.0 ppm, so that can't be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the 11 ppm is an aldehyde proton, but then the substituents wouldn't be para. So perhaps option A is the one.

Wait, option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl in position 3, OH in position 2, and aldehyde in position 1. Wait, benzene with substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). That would make the ring with all three substituents. But the NMR shows only two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests maybe only two unique aromatic protons. That would be the case if substituents are in such a way that two sets of equivalent protons remain.

Wait, benzaldehyde has the structure PhCHO. If there are substituents in the ortho and meta positions, would that lead to two doublets? Let me think: if substituents are at positions 2 (OH) and 3 (Cl), then the protons ortho to the substituents would be in certain positions. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is such that there are two equivalent protons and another two that are also equivalent, leading to two doublets.

But I'm not as confident about this structure matching the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm peak isn't O-H. Another idea: maybe it's the aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. If it's at 11, that's a bit unusual but possible if there's strong deshielding. So in option A, the aldehyde would have a proton around 10 ppm, but here it's 11. The 32% peak at m/z 158: that's M+2. So 156 + 2 = 158. The molecular formula would be C7 H5 Cl O2 (from option A), which has a Cl and an O. So M is 156. M+2 could be due to Cl's isotope (35Cl is about 75% abundant, so 35Cl would contribute to M+3? Wait, no. Wait, the molecular weight is 156; M+2 is 158. So the possible isotope would be Cl (35Cl is 75%, 37Cl is 25%)? Wait, wait, let me think:

The molecular formula for option A: C7 H5 Cl O2. Cl has an atomic weight of about 35.5. So the molecular weight would be (7*12) +5 +35.5 + (2*16) = 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So M is approximately 156.5. So M+2 would be 158.5, but the peak is at 158. Wait, that's a possible isotope. But Cl's main isotope is 35 (75%) and 37 (25%). So M would have Cl-35 (35), M+2 would be Cl-37 (37). So the peak at 158 (32%) corresponds to M+2 (37Cl), which is 25% abundance. Wait, but the given is 32%. Hmm, that doesn't quite match. So maybe the M+2 isn't from Cl. Alternatively, is there another isotope in the molecule?

Wait, another possibility: the M+2 is from oxygen isotopes. But oxygen is mostly O-16, with O-17 and O-18 being negligible. So M+2 is unlikely from O.

Another option: maybe it's from sodium? No, the options don't have sodium.

Alternatively, maybe the M+2 comes from a double Cl, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the M+2 is from a different source. Maybe in the case of option B, which is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the molecular formula is C7 H5 Cl O2. So, same as option A. So same molecular ion and same M+2.

So, the NMR data is the key here.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The aromatic protons would be in two doublets. For a para-substituted benzene with two strong groups (Cl and COOH), the protons adjacent to Cl would be more deshielded and appear upfield or downfield?

Wait, I think the substituents would cause the ring current to deshield the protons. So, the protons ortho to the substituents would be more downfield. So, in the case of para-substituted groups, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet.

The NMR data shows 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). The 8.02 would be more downfield, which would be the protons next to the electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl and COOH). The 7.72 would be the other set.

The 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) would be the COOH O-H. But in reality, the O-H proton is usually broad, not a sharp singlet. But perhaps in some cases, like if the solution is deuterated or if it's a DMSO-d6 solution, it might appear as a sharp peak, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 11 ppm is not O-H. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, then that would be the only acidic proton. So if the NMR shows another singlet, that's confusing. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, like option A, the 11 ppm could be the aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. 11 is a bit high, but possible. Also, the IR would have a peak around 1720, which is consistent with an aldehyde's carbonyl.

But in the IR, the broad peak is from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That would be the O-H from the hydroxyl group in option A. But the NMR for option A would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet around 10 ppm, and the O-H as a phenolic or aliphatic O-H. Wait, but in option A, the O-H is a phenolic group attached to the benzene ring in the ortho position. Phenolic O-H typically appear around 5-7 ppm, but if it's in a different environment, perhaps it's more deshielded. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data for option A would have:

Aldehyde proton: around 9-10 ppm, perhaps, but in this case it's 11 ppm.

Phenolic O-H: around 5-7 ppm. But the given data has a peak at 11 ppm, which is a singlet.

In the NMR, option A's aromatic protons would be more complex. Let's think about the structure:

Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So positions 4,5,6 would have H's. Depending on the substituents, the ring protons would have different shifts. But I'm not confident about how the splitting would work here.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR for option A would have more than two sets of aromatic protons, but the given data only shows two doublets. So maybe option A doesn't fit.

So returning to option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

If the 11 ppm is the O-H, perhaps in this case it's a sharp singlet. I'm not sure why it's a singlet. Maybe because the solution is concentrated or some other reason. Alternatively, maybe in the NMR data, the O-H is exchanging and appearing as a singlet.

Putting all together, the molecular weight matches, the NMR aromatic protons match, the IR has a carbonyl peak, and the mass spec has M and M+2 peaks.

So I think the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) indicates a molecular weight of 156. A secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, as this corresponds to the **M + 2** isotope peak due to the natural abundance of chlorine-37. 

### IR Analysis:
- A **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is consistent with an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol group.
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: This is a highly deshielded proton, characteristic of a carboxylic acid O-H proton, though it appears as a singlet, which is unusual for an O-H stretch that is typically broad.
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggest a **para-substituted aromatic ring**, as the protons are split into two equivalent sets due to the symmetry of the substituents.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound has a benzaldehyde group, a hydroxyl group, and a chlorine atom in the ortho and meta positions.  
   - The NMR would not show two doublets for the aromatic protons, as the substituents are not para to each other.  
   - The aldehyde proton typically appears around 9-10 ppm, but the given peak at 11.0 ppm does not match.  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions on the benzene ring.  
   - The **para-substitution** explains the two doublets in the NMR (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm), as the aromatic protons are split into two equivalent sets.  
   - The **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** corresponds to the O-H proton of the carboxylic acid, though its sharp appearance is unusual.  
   - The molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂** matches the molecular weight of 156, and the **M + 2** peak at 158 is consistent with the presence of chlorine.  
   - **Fits all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - This compound has a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-) attached to a benzene ring.  
   - The molecular formula **C₈H₇ClO₂** has a molecular weight of 168.5, which does not match the given molecular ion at 156.  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in the ortho positions on the benzene ring.  
   - The NMR would not show two doublets for the aromatic protons, as the substituents are not para to each other.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data (molecular weight, IR, and NMR) are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution of the chlorine and carboxylic acid groups explains the NMR splitting pattern, and the molecular formula matches the given data.

**Answer: B**
