Okay, so I need to figure out which two aromatic compounds are present in the mixture based on the given NMR data. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, the molecular formula for each compound in the options should fit that. Let's check each one quickly:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: Benzene ring with four methyl groups. Benzene is C6H6, each methyl adds a CH3. So 6 carbons from benzene plus 4*(CH3) makes C6 + C4 (since each methyl is one C). Wait, that would be C10? Wait, C6 + 4*(1 C each from CH3) → C10? No, wait. Benzene is 6 carbons, each methyl (CH3) adds one carbon each, so 4 methyls add 4 carbons. So total is 6 + 4 = 10 carbons. Hydrogens: Benzene has 6 H. Each methyl adds 3 H, so 4*3=12. So total H would be 6 + 12 = 18. But the molecular formula is C10H14. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) adds 4* (CH3) → so each CH3 adds a C and three H. But the overall formula would be C6 +4C = C10, and H: 6 +4*3 = 18 H. But the given formula is C10H14, which is 14 H. So this doesn't match. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Each methyl group replaces a hydrogen on the benzene ring. So each CH3 adds 3 H (since it's a substituent). But the benzene ring starts with 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H, so 4 substituents would mean 6 -4=2 H left on the ring. So total H is 2 (from ring) + 4*3 (from methyl groups) = 2 +12=14. Oh! So the formula is correct. So 1,2,4,5-t
