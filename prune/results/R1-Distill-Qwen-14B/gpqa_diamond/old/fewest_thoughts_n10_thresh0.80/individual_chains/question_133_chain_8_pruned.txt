Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1 gram each in 200 cm³ of solution. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions... I think orthophosphate is HPO4^3- or PO4^3-? Or maybe it's H2PO4^-? Oh right, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, the phosphate ions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-? Or wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-. Hmm, no, I think orthophosphate is the primary form, which is H3PO4, but when it's in solution, it dissociates. So maybe in this question, the orthophosphate ion they're referring to is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, actually, when H3PO4 loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^-, which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. Then, losing another proton gives HPO4^2-, which is hydrogen phosphate, and then PO4^3- is phosphate ion. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the various ions are the deprotonated forms. So, maybe in this context, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, so I need to find [HPO4^2-] in the solution.

So, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- (since K is +1, H2PO4^- is -1). So, that gives me H2PO4^- ions.

Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na is +1, so two give +2, so HPO4^2- is -2). So, that gives HPO4^2- ions.

So in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But phosphate exists in solution in a series of equilibria, so these can interconvert.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. I'm a bit confused. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So if both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 contribute to different phosphate species, but the question is about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of both salts creates a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO
