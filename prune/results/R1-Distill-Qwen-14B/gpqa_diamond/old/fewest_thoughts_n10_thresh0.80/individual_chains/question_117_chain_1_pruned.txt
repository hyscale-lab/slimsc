Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are called enantiomers. So the molecule must have a chiral center or some other kind of asymmetry to exhibit optical activity.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can have different substituents on each ring. Since it's a biphenyl with substituents, I'm thinking about whether it has a plane of symmetry or not. Wait, the substituents are at 6 and 6' positions, and the carboxylate groups are at 2 and 2'. So the biphenyl might have substituents in such a way that it doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that are mirror images, then maybe it's meso, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can have E and Z configurations. Wait, biphenyls usually have different conformations but not isomerism. Wait, but wait—if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, like if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it could have enantiomers. So for biphenyls, if the substituents are such that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule might be chiral. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Let me think—dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro... So each phenyl ring has a nitro group at 6 and 6', and the other substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, which are carboxylate esters. So the structure would have two nitro groups on opposite ends and two ester groups on the 2 positions. Wait, no, 6 is the opposite of 2 on a benzene ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So the substituents are at positions that are across from each other on each ring. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the substituents are in positions that when mirrored, the molecule looks the same, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, then it would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but biphenyl rings can have different configurations. The substituents on each ring, like the nitro and ester groups, might lead to different arrangements. If the two phenyl rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the substituents are at 6 and 6', which are para positions on each ring. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I'll come back to this one and check the others first.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure is CH3CO-O-C(OH)CH3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the
