Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best. So, the question is about a series of reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Alright, let's parse the information given. First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I should figure out what these compounds could be. Let's start by thinking about the reactions.

The first reaction is A + 8B → C. Bright red product C—maybe a transition metal compound? Like copper or something similar. 8 equivalents of B? Maybe B is a diatomic gas. For instance, if A is copper metal (solid), and B is sulfur dioxide (SO2), but wait, how many equivalents would that be? Alternatively, maybe B is another gas like O2 or maybe even something else.

Wait, another approach: think about the second reaction. C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to produce E. D is a gas. E is hazardous—could be something like a toxic gas or a dangerous compound. Also, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents are usually things like water, ethanol, but also maybe something like HCl, but that's a gas. Wait, H is a solvent, so maybe it's something like ethanol or something else, but perhaps H is H2O? But D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H. Hmm.

Let me think of common reactions. Let's say B is O2. Then, D reacting with O2 could form something like H2O, if D is H2. Wait, but D reacts with B (O2) in a 1:1 ratio. H would then be H2O. But H is a solvent, which makes sense.

So if B is O2, and D is H2, then H is H2O. Alternatively, think of other possibilities. Suppose B is Cl2, which is a diatomic gas. Then D could be something like O2, but D reacts with B to form H. Or maybe D is H2, which when reacts with Cl2 in 1:1 would form HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, if B is O2, D could be C (carbon), but that's a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The second reaction: C + 2D → E. If C is a metal sulfide, reacting with HCl (if D is HCl?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, C is a metal oxide?

Wait, let me think about the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C must be a compound that upon hydrolysis yields two acids. One strong, one weak.

Common compounds that hydrolyze to produce acids include metal sulfites, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitride. For example, Ca3N2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 and NH3? But NH3 isn't an acid. Hmm. Alternatively,
