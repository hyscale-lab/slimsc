Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, let me read the details carefully.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's useful. The NMR data is provided, and the reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I think those reagents are part of a reaction sequence, maybe something like diazotization followed by hydrolysis or something else.

Looking at the NMR first. The 1H NMR data is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H

I need to figure out what structure this corresponds to. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the possible functional groups. The NMR has a triplet at 9.72, which is a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or a triplet if coupled with another proton, like in a conjugated system. So maybe there's an aldehyde group.

The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm regions are in the aromatic region. The doublets suggest possible coupling between adjacent aromatic protons, maybe para substitution. Let's see: 6.98 ppm is more downfield, which could be a proton ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro or carbonyl. Wait, the molecule has an NO in the formula, so maybe a nitro group? Or perhaps an amide or something else.

Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degrees of unsaturation can help. Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1 (assuming X is 0; no halogens). So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees: maybe three rings (like benzene is 3, and a double bond or ring each for others), or a combination.

Looking at the NMR again, the aromatic protons: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That pattern is typical for a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets each integrating 2H suggest that each is a pair of protons, so maybe two para-substituted aromatic groups. Wait, but the integration is
