Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about magnetic fields and the hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and that m is small. B is 1 Tesla. I need to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, paramagnetic coupling term... Oh right, in atoms, the magnetic interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the external magnetic field is the paramagnetic term. The Hamiltonian for that is usually something like -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The paramagnetic term is part of the Zeeman effect, I think. The Zeeman effect involves the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The paramagnetic term would cause a shift in the energy levels. 

The problem says m is small. Hmm, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So if m is small, maybe we're considering cases where m is much less than the maximum possible, which for a given orbital is up to l. But wait, I'm not sure how that affects the comparison here. Maybe it's a clue about the magnitude of the energy shift.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So I can calculate ΔE using Planck's constant h, speed of light c, and the given wavelength.

Let me jot that down. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. So:

ΔE = hc / λ

Plugging in the numbers, h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So let's compute that.

Wait, but wait. For a hydrogen atom, the transition energy from one level to another is given by ΔE = (hcR)(1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)), where R is the Rydberg constant. Wait, but the problem just gives the wavelength, so perhaps it's using E = hc/λ. So maybe it's assuming that ΔE is the energy corresponding to that photon wavelength.

But I can calculate ΔE. Let's compute it numerically.

First, calculate hc. h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So hc is about 1.987e-15 J·m.

Wait, no, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Oh wait, no, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3) = 19.878e-26, which is 1.9878e-25 J·m. Right.

But then, λ is 486.1e-9 meters (since 1 micrometer is 1e-6 m, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1e-9 m). So ΔE = hc / λ = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (486.1e-9 m).

Let me compute that. 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx (2e-25)/(5e-7) ) = 4e-19 J. Wait, let's calculate it accurately.

1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18.

1.9878 /4.861 is approximately 0.409. So 0.409e-18 J. So about 4.09e-19 J. Hmm, that's the ΔE.

Now, what about the paramagnetic term. The paramagnetic coupling term in the hydrogen atom's Hamiltonian is the Zeeman term. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic term, which is something like H = -μ·B.

The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1) + 3m^2)/(some factor?), wait no. Alternatively, the magnetic dipole moment for an electron is μ = g * (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, where g is the Landé g-factor. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the orbital magnetic dipole moment is μ = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So the energy due to the magnetic field is E = -μ·B. Since B is in the Oz direction, and assuming the magnetic moment is also along Oz, the energy shift is E = -μ_B * m * B.

Wait, but the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be the energy shift. So ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * m * B, but considering the sign depends on direction, but for magnitude comparison, it's proportional to m*B.

Wait, but in the problem statement, m is small. So m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -l to +l, but l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. But if m is small, perhaps m is much less than l, but for hydrogen, the states with higher energy levels have larger l, but m could be small. Alternatively, perhaps m is zero or ±1, but I'm not sure.

But regardless, the paramagnetic term is proportional to m*B. So if m is small, say, m=0, then the term would be zero. But I think the question is considering the magnitude, so perhaps it's a generic case where m is small but non-zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The paramagnetic term is given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment is μ = (μ_B) * (L_z)/ħ * ħ, so μ = μ_B L_z, perhaps? Or more accurately, L_z is ħ m, so μ = μ_B m.

Thus, the energy shift due to the magnetic field is E = -μ·B = -μ_B m B.

So the expectation value is ⟨H⟩ = -μ_B m B.

But the magnitude is |⟨H⟩| = μ_B |m| B.

So the paramagnetic term is proportional to μ_B * m * B.

Now, I need to compare this paramagnetic term with ΔE, which we calculated as approximately 4.09e-19 J.

So let's compute μ_B * m * B.

μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T.

B is 1 T.

So μ_B * B is 9.274e-24 J.

Now, m is small. Let's think, what is the typical value of m for a hydrogen atom? For hydrogen, the ground state is l=0, so m=0. But when l=1 (n=2), m can be -1, 0, +1. So the maximum m is 1 in that case. But the question says "small values of m", so perhaps m is around 1, maybe 0.5? Wait, no, m is an integer. Wait, but in the problem statement, "small" might mean m is much smaller than some other quantity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the paramagnetic term as the perturbation and ΔE as another energy scale, perhaps the transition energy. So if the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE, then it's negligible, but if it's comparable, it's significant.

Wait, but let me calculate the paramagnetic term. Let's assume m=1 for the sake of this calculation.

So paramagnetic term would be μ_B * m * B = (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Compare that to ΔE which is 4.09e-19 J.

So 9.274e-24 J is much smaller than 4.09e-19 J. Because 9e-24 is 9e-5 times 1e-19. So 9e-24 is 0.00009 times 1e-19, which is 9e-5 times smaller. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait. What if m is not 1 but larger? Wait, the problem says m is small, so for m=0, the term is zero. So if m is small, say m=1, then the term is
