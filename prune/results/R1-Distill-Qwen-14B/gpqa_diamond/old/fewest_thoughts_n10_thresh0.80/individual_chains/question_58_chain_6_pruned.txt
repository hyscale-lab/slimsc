Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization exactly? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite values that pop up in calculations. So, it's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or something, and then removing it later. But some theories don't need this because they're already finite, right?

Looking at the options. Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version, right? Like Maxwell's equations. In classical theories, do you have problems with divergences? I think in QED (which is option C), you have issues with things like the electron self-energy, which is why you need renormalization. But wait, what about regularization? I'm not sure if classical theories require regularization because they don't involve the same infinities as quantum theories. Oh, because regularization is a quantum field theory thing. So maybe D doesn't need regularization because it's classical.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics. QED does require renormalization, which I think includes regularization as part of the process. So QED isn't the correct answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong force. I remember that QCD has issues with things like Landau poles, which are problems that appear at high energies, so you might need to regularize. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Because QCD is asymptotically free, does that mean it's more manageable? But regardless, I think QCD calculations would still require regularization techniques because of loop divergences.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Strings are supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as point particles because they have more degrees of freedom. But I'm not sure if it requires regularization. Wait, string theories often deal with higher dimensions and different backgrounds, but I thought they still need some form of regularization, especially in perturbative calculations. Or maybe not? Or perhaps because string theory is a background-dependent theory, it doesn't have the same issues as QFT, so maybe it doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but what's the deal with regularization? Regularization is a method used in QFT to make divergent integrals finite by introducing some cutoff, like a small parameter, and then taking the limit as that parameter goes to zero. But in some theories, like the ones that are "non-perturbatively finite" or have no divergences, you wouldn't need it.

Wait, so which theories are finite? I remember that in QED, you have to renormalize because of the divergences in loop diagrams. But maybe some theories don't have these divergences. For example, classical theories don't have quantum divergences because they don't involve the same calculations as quantum theories. So classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same infinities
