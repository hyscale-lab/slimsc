Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions and then analyzing the products. The products are run on both standard and chiral HPLC columns. I need to determine how many peaks appear in each case.

Let's break down the problem.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.
Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.

Wait, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. I remember that mCPBA is commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. Oh right, when an alkene reacts with a peracid, it forms an epoxide. So both reactions are epoxidations.

But wait, after epoxidation, there's an aqueous acid workup. Oh, right! Epoxides under acidic conditions can undergo ring-opening reactions. Let me recall: epoxide ring opening in acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of diols, specifically vicinal diols because the epoxide oxygen becomes a leaving group, and the adjacent carbons get hydroxyl groups.

Wait no, actually, epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions (like H3O+ or H2SO4) leads to the formation of a diol. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens, and the nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon because of the partial positive charge in that carbocation-like transition state. Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, the diol would be the same regardless of which carbon the water attacks first.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule. Let me think. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2 on both sides of the double bond in the trans configuration. But when it becomes an epoxide, the symmetry might change.

Wait, the structure of (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end. Wait, let me draw it.

Wait, no. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, 4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, the four positions: 1,2,3,4. So 4-ene is between carbons 4 and 5 in an eight-carbon chain.

Wait, no, no. Let's think again: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait. The structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct. Oct-4-ene has the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's seven carbons. Wait, octene has eight carbons. So, for 4-ene, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, no. Let's count.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH-

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure for 4-octene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of the epoxide formation and the diol.

Wait, when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, an epoxide is formed. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, the epoxide would have the oxygen on opposite sides of the ring. Wait, no, wait. Epoxidation of a trans-alkene would lead to a trans epoxide. Let me think: in epoxidation, the two new oxygen bonds are formed on the same face of the alkene because mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond in a concerted manner. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, the epoxide will form with the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Wait, that might lead to different diastereomers when the epoxide is opened.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the epoxide structure. For (E)-oct-4-ene, when epoxidized, the epoxide is formed with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, making it a trans epoxide. Because the starting alkene is trans, the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite.

Wait, no, wait. When mCPBA adds to a double bond, it forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are added across the double bond in a specific way. For a trans double bond, the oxygen adds on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. Let me think. When mCPBA (a peracid) reacts with a double bond, the oxygen from the peracid adds across the double bond. The reaction is stereospecific. For a trans double bond, the addition would be such that the two new oxygen atoms are on the same face or opposite faces?

Wait, the peracid attacks the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds across the double bond, maintaining the stereochemistry. So the configuration of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, for a trans-alkene, the addition of the epoxide oxygen would lead to a trans epoxide. Hmm, maybe I should think of a specific example.

Let's say we have (E)-but-2-ene. When epoxidized, the epoxide would have the two methyl groups on opposite sides of the oxygen bridge. So the epoxide is a trans-epoxide.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two substituents (the two CH2CH2 groups) on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

After epoxidation, the next step is treatment with aqueous acid. So the epoxide ring opens. Now, under acidic conditions, the ring opening of an epoxide leads to a diol. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring breaks, and a nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon because of the partial positive charge in the transition state.

Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, the attack is equally likely on either carbon, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, in this case, the epoxide is not symmetric because the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z). Or wait, no, oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule. Oh, wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric because both ends are CH2CH2 groups. So for both (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be symmetric.

Wait, no. Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (since it's a trans configuration, but the substituents are the same on both sides). So when it forms the epoxide, the molecule would still be symmetric. Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are same on both ends but cis. So the epoxide would be symmetric in both cases.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: for (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but that's not possible because oct-4-ene would have four carbons on each end. Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but that might not be right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the structure of oct-4-ene as CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's not possible because that would be more than eight carbons. Wait, no, let me count: the formula for octene is C8H16. So, 4-ene would have the structure CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. No, that can't be right because that would have more than eight carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try writing it correctly.

Oct-4-ene would be: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be because that would imply the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5, but that would require the structure to be CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but that's only seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on this, but perhaps it's not critical for solving the problem. Let's proceed.

So, regardless, when the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it forms a diol. For a symmetric epoxide, the diol would form, but depending on the starting epoxide's configuration, the diol could have different stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait—epoxide ring opening in acidic conditions leads to the formation of a diol. For a symmetric epoxide, the diol can form in two ways. Wait, no—a symmetric epoxide, upon ring-opening, would lead to a single diol, because both carbons are the same. So, if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a single compound because both ends are identical.

Wait, but if the epoxide isn't symmetric, then the diol could have two different stereoisomers, but in this case, since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a single compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene. Since the alkene is trans, the epoxide would have the two oxygens on opposite faces. But since the molecule is symmetric, the epoxide is a single compound, but perhaps with a specific configuration.

Then, when the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the diol formed would have specific stereochemistry.

Wait, when the epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening under acidic conditions would lead to a diol that's a single compound because the two possible attack positions are the same. So the diol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, but in a specific configuration.

Wait, but for a symmetric epoxide, like from (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol would form with a specific configuration. Let me think about this.

Wait, for a symmetric epoxide, when it opens under acidic conditions, the nucleophile (water) can attack either carbon equally. But since the epoxide is symmetric, the resulting diol will have the same configuration regardless of which carbon is attacked first. Hmm, but wait, no. Because the attack can happen on either carbon, but the product would be the same, so the diol would form as a single compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of a specific example. Take cyclohexene oxide, which is symmetric. When it's treated with acid, the diol that forms is a single product. Because both ends are the same, so attack on either carbon leads to the same product. So the diol would be a single stereoisomer, but wait, wait, no—wait, in reality, cyclohexene oxide upon acid-catalyzed ring-opening gives a trans-diol because the nucleophile attacks the more substituted (or same in this case) carbon, but in a way that leads to trans configuration.

Wait, no. Actually, in the case of cyclohexene oxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions leads to the formation of a diol with cis stereochemistry, because the nucleophile attacks the same face.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think about the mechanism again. In acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. The ring breaks, and the adjacent carbons bear partial positive charges. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (maybe). So the attack is on the more substituted carbon.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide, both carbons are equally substituted, so the attack can happen on either carbon, but since the structure is symmetric, the product is the same. So the diol formed is a single compound.

But what about the stereochemistry of the diol? For example, if the epoxide is symmetric and opens in such a way that the hydroxyl groups end up on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, perhaps the attack occurs with the nucleophile coming from the same face as the leaving group. So if the epoxide is formed in such a way that the two oxygens are on opposite faces (like in a trans configuration), then the attack would lead to the diol with the hydroxyl groups on the same face.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the epoxide ring opening.

Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA would form an epoxide where the two oxygen atoms are on opposite faces because the starting alkene is trans. So the epoxide is a trans epoxide. Then, under acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens. The ring opening leads to the attack of the nucleophile (water) from the less hindered side.

Wait, but in a trans epoxide, the two oxygens are on opposite sides. So when the ring opens, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. Because the epoxide is symmetric, both carbons are equally substituted, so either can be attacked. But because the epoxide is symmetric, the product would have the same outcome regardless of which carbon is attacked.

Wait, but the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the site of attack and the configuration of the epoxide.

So, for the (E)-epoxide (from (E)-oct-4-ene), the epoxide is trans. When it opens under acidic conditions, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on opposite faces, leading to a trans-diol.

Wait, no. Let me think. If the epoxide is trans, when it opens, the nucleophile attacks from the same face, leading to the formation of a diol where the hydroxyls are on the same face, leading to a cis diol. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, maybe I should look at the mechanism. In the acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide, the epoxide oxygen becomes protonated, making it a better leaving group. The ring breaks, and a transition state forms where the adjacent carbons have partial positive charges. The nucleophile attacks the more substituted (more stable) carbocation-like position.

In the case of a trans epoxide, such as from (E)-oct-4-ene, when the ring opens, the nucleophile (water) would attack the same face as the leaving oxygen. So the hydroxyl groups would end up on adjacent carbons but on the same face, leading to a cis diol.

Wait, but in reality, when a trans epoxide opens, the diol formed is a trans diol because the attack occurs from opposite faces. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's imagine a simple trans epoxide, like (E)-but-2-ene oxide. The structure is O-CR2-CR2-O, with the two R groups on opposite sides. When acid is added, the epoxide oxygen is protonated. The ring opens, and the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. Because the two oxygens are on opposite sides, the attack occurs from opposite faces. So the two hydroxyls end up on opposite faces, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, that makes sense. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which forms a trans epoxide, the diol would be a trans diol.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is cis, the epoxide would be cis (the two oxygens on the same face), and upon ring opening, the diol would be a cis diol.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in the case of a cis epoxide, when the ring opens, the nucleophile would attack from the same face, leading to the diol's hydroxyl groups being on the same face, hence a cis diol.

But wait, in the case of a symmetric epoxide, like (E)-oct-4-ene, which is symmetric, the diol formed would have a particular configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the specific cases.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → diol (trans? Or cis?).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → diol (cis? Or trans?).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the diol products.

When mCPBA epoxidizes a trans-alkene, the epoxide is trans. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol formed would be trans.

Similarly, epoxidizing a cis-alkene (Z) would form a cis-epoxide, which upon acid treatment would form a cis-diol.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think.

For the (E)-epoxide (trans), which is symmetric, the diol formed would have the two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol. But wait, if the starting epoxide is symmetric, would the diol be a single compound with a specific stereochemistry, or could it form a mixture?

Wait, perhaps in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have a single stereoisomer because the epoxide is symmetric. Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the diol would also have a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would form only one product, regardless of the starting epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but in reality, the diol's configuration depends on the starting epoxide's configuration. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans, leading to a trans diol. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis, leading to a cis diol.

But wait, in the case of symmetric epoxides, such as those formed from (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene, the diols would each form a single stereoisomer. So Reaction 1 produces a trans diol, and Reaction 2 produces a cis diol.

Wait, but wait a second. (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are enantiomers, right? Because they're mirror images. But when epoxidized, they form epoxides that are enantiomers as well. Then, upon ring opening, the diols would be enantiomers?

No, wait, because the starting alkenes are enantiomers, their epoxides would also be enantiomers. Then, upon ring-opening, the diols would be enantiomers as well.

Wait, but that depends on whether the epoxide is symmetric. If the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would be a single compound, but if it's not symmetric, then the diol would have stereoisomers.

Wait, but let's get back to the problem. Both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 start with enantiomers of oct-4-ene. Each is epoxidized to form their respective epoxides, which are enantiomers. Then, each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid to form diols.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol (let's say it's trans-diol, but is it a single compound or a racemic mixture? Wait, no, the diol is formed from a symmetric epoxide, so it's a single compound. So the diol from Reaction 1 would be a trans diol, which is a single compound.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol (cis diol, also a single compound).

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think about this. If the starting alkene is (E), the epoxide is trans. When it's opened under acidic conditions, the diol would have a certain configuration. But when the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would have a specific configuration, perhaps leading to a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture.

Wait, no. If the epoxide is symmetric, then upon ring-opening, the diol would have two identical stereocenters, but whether they are the same or opposite depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the diol structure.

Let me imagine the epoxide as O-CR2-CR2-O where R groups are the same on both ends. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two oxygens on opposite sides, making it a trans epoxide. Upon acid-catalyzed ring opening, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a cis diol? Or trans?

Wait, perhaps an example would help. Let's take cis-2,3-epoxybutane and trans-2,3-epoxybutane.

Cis-epoxide: the oxygen atoms are on the same face. When it opens under acid, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on the same face, leading to a trans diol? Or maybe a cis diol?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the mechanism. In the acid-catalyzed opening, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. The ring breaks, and the carbons form a partial positive charge. The nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. In a symmetric epoxide, both are equally substituted, so either can be attacked.

In the case of a trans epoxide (O on opposite faces), when the ring opens, the water attacks the same face leading to the formation of a diol with the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, making it a trans diol.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's imagine an epoxide where the two oxygens are on opposite faces (trans). The ring breaks, and the nucleophile attacks from the same face as the leaving group. So the hydroxyl groups end up on the same face, leading to a cis diol.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's the opposite. Let me think of a specific example.

If the epoxide is trans, then the two oxygens are on opposite sides. When the ring opens, the nucleophile attacks the same face as the leaving oxygen. So if the leaving oxygen was on the top face, the nucleophile would come from the top, leading to the hydroxyl group on the same face.

Wait, perhaps I should use a model. Let me imagine a trans epoxide. The two carbons connected by the epoxide oxygen have the oxygen on opposite faces. So, when the ring opens, the nucleophile attacks one carbon from the top and the other from the bottom, leading to the hydroxyl groups on opposite faces. Wait, no, because in a trans epoxide, the two oxygens are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide breaks, the nucleophile attacks each carbon from the same face as the leaving oxygen.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for a mnemonic. For epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the diol formed has the same stereochemistry as the epoxide. Because the nucleophile attacks the same face.

Wait, no. The diol's stereochemistry is opposite to the epoxide's because of the way the ring opens.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the ring opens. The epoxide oxygen is protonated, leading to the breaking of the O-C bonds. The adjacent carbons have partial positive charges. The nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. For a trans epoxide, the two carbons are on opposite faces. So the attack would be from the same face as the leaving group, leading to the hydroxyl groups being on the same face as the original oxygen.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should move forward with the problem, assuming that Reaction 1 leads to a trans diol and Reaction 2 leads to a cis diol.

Each reaction produces a single diol (since the starting epoxide is symmetric, leading to a single diol product). So Reaction 1 gives a trans-diol, and Reaction 2 gives a cis-diol.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the diols from the two reactions enantiomers? Because the starting alkenes are enantiomers, their diols would be enantiomers as well.

So, if Reaction 1 gives a trans-diol, and Reaction 2 gives a cis-diol, but wait, I'm not sure about trans and cis.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are each a pair of enantiomers. But no, because the starting epoxides are enantiomers, which upon opening would form diols that are also enantiomers.

Wait, no. Because the starting alkenes are enantiomers, their epoxide products are enantiomers, and the diols formed would also be enantiomers.

Wait, but wait: the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene (Reaction 1) is a trans-diol, and the diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene (Reaction 2) is a cis-diol. But if that's the case, then the two diols are different compounds, each with a specific configuration.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let's think differently.

Each reaction produces a diol. Now, if the diols are enantiomers, then when they are mixed, the chiral HPLC would separate them into two peaks, while the standard HPLC would show them as a single peak if the column is achiral and doesn't separate enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene becomes an epoxide, which then becomes a diol. Similarly, Reaction 2 produces a different diol.

Wait, perhaps the diols are each a pair of enantiomers, but in each reaction, only a single diastereomer forms.

Wait, no. Let me think: each reaction produces one stereoisomer of the diol. So, the diol from Reaction 1 is a single enantiomer, and the diol from Reaction 2 is another single enantiomer.

Wait, but no, because the starting alkenes are enantiomers. So when each is epoxidized, the epoxides are enantiomers, and when each epoxide is opened, the diols are enantiomers.

So, the diols from Reactions 1 and 2 are enantiomers. So when both products are combined, you have a racemic mixture of each diol? No, wait, no. Because each reaction produces a single enantiomer of the diol.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: Reaction 1 produces a diol that is a single enantiomer (say, R,R). Reaction 2 produces the enantiomer of that diol (S,S). So when you mix them, you have equal amounts of R,R and S,S, which are enantiomers. So in a standard (achiral) HPLC, they would appear as a single peak because the column doesn't distinguish enantiomers. But in a chiral HPLC, they would appear as two separate peaks because the column can differentiate between enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if each reaction produces the same diol (which is not possible because the starting alkenes are enantiomers and would lead to enantiomeric diols), then perhaps each diol is a single enantiomer, and when mixed, you have two enantiomers.

Wait, but wait—no. Let me think again. (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are enantiomers. When each is epoxidized, the epoxides are enantiomers as well. Then, each epoxide, upon ring-opening, forms a diol. So, the diols from each reaction are enantiomers.

So, Reaction 1 gives diol A, and Reaction 2 gives diol B, which is the enantiomer of diol A.

So when you combine the products, you have a 1:1 mixture of diol A and diol B.

Now, when you run this mixture on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, enantiomers would not be separated. So you would see a single peak for the mixture, because the column can't distinguish between the two enantiomers.

But wait, the question says that both reactions go to 100% completion. So each reaction produces a single diol.

But wait, no, because each diol is a single enantiomer. So, when you combine them, you have two enantiomeric diols. So in the standard HPLC, they would co-elute as a single peak, while in a chiral HPLC, they would separate into two peaks.

But wait, no—because each reaction produces a single diol, but each diol is a single enantiomer. So when you combine them, you have two enantiomers, each from their respective reactions.

But then, the question is, when you run them on HPLC, what happens?

Wait, the products of Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would be diastereomers? Or enantiomers?

Wait, no. Let me think: (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are enantiomers. Their epoxides are enantiomers. Upon ring-opening, each epoxide forms a diol. So, the diols would be enantiomers.

So, Reaction 1 gives diol 1, and Reaction 2 gives diol 2, which is the enantiomer of diol 1.

Thus, the combined product mixture contains diol 1 and diol 2 in equal amounts.

Now, when this mixture is run on a standard (achiral) HPLC, the two enantiomers would not be separated, so only one peak would appear.

But wait, the options don't have that. Wait, the options are:

A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC
C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces more than one product. For example, maybe the diol can form as a racemic mixture, but that doesn't fit with the problem statement which says both reactions go to 100% completion.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the diol structure. When the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the diol could form with two possible configurations, leading to two enantiomers, but only one is formed, as the reaction goes to completion. So each reaction produces a single diol enantiomer.

Wait, but that leads to the product mixture containing two diastereomers (if the diols are diastereomers) or enantiomers (if the diols are enantiomers).

Wait, no, the diols from Reactions 1 and 2 would be enantiomers. So combining them would give a racemic mixture.

But then, when run on a standard HPLC (achiral), they would appear as a single peak. On a chiral HPLC, they would appear as two peaks.

So in the standard HPLC, one peak, and in the chiral HPLC, two peaks.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have one peak in standard and two in chiral. The options are:

A) 4 in each
B) 2 standard, 3 chiral
C) 2 in each
D) 3 standard, 4 chiral.

Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, not enantiomers. Let me think again.

Wait, when (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, it forms a trans-epoxide. Upon acidic opening, does this lead to a single diol or a pair of diastereomers?

Wait, for a trans-epoxide, is the diol formed a single compound or a pair of enantiomers? Let's consider (E)-oct-4-ene: the epoxide is symmetric, so the diol formed would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, but in a specific configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would form as a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers. So each reaction produces a single diol, and the two diols from the two reactions would be enantiomers.

But then, when you mix them, you have a racemic mixture, leading to one peak on standard HPLC and two on chiral.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. Let me think again.

Wait, no. For a symmetric epoxide, the ring opening under acidic conditions would lead to a single product. So, Reaction 1 (E) -> diol A, Reaction 2 (Z) -> diol B, which is enantiomer of diol A.

So when the products are mixed, you have diol A and diol B in equal amounts.

Standard HPLC (achiral): one peak.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But none of the options match this scenario. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces more than one product. For example, each epoxide could lead to two diastereomers.

Wait, but that would require the epoxide to be unsymmetric, which it isn't in this case. Because (E)-oct-4-ene is symmetric, so the epoxide is symmetric. So the diol is a single product.

Wait, but perhaps each diol has two stereocenters, so it's a pair of enantiomers.

No, because in a symmetric diol, the two stereocenters are identical, so it's either a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, if the diol from Reaction 1 is a meso compound, then it would be achiral, leading to a single peak in both HPLC columns.

Wait, let me think. If the diol has two stereocenters but is a meso compound, it would be achiral. So, when you run it on any HPLC, it would appear as a single peak.

But in this case, whether the diol is meso or not depends on its configuration.

So, if the diol from Reaction 1 is a meso compound, then both Reactions 1 and 2 would produce the same meso compound, leading to a single product.

Wait, that can't be right because Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 are starting from enantiomers. So maybe each reaction produces a different diastereomer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let's approach this differently.

Let me think about the possible products.

Each reaction produces a diol. Let's say Reaction 1 produces Diol A, and Reaction 2 produces Diol B.

If Diol A and Diol B are the same compound, then both reactions would produce the same product. But since the starting alkenes are enantiomers, the diols must be enantiomers of each other.

So, when combined, the mixture contains both enantiomers.

Therefore, in standard HPLC (achiral), they would appear as a single peak. In chiral HPLC, they would separate into two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps each reaction produces more than one diol.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers of the diol, leading to a total of four products.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the ring-opening of a symmetric epoxide in acidic conditions would lead to a single diol product.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide can open in two different ways, leading to different diols. For example, in an asymmetric epoxide, the ring-opening can lead to two different diastereomers. But in a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening leads to a single diol.

So, for Reaction 1, the epoxide is symmetric, leading to a single diol. Similarly, Reaction 2 leads to a single diol, which is the enantiomer of Reaction 1's diol.

So, the combined product has two diols, which are enantiomers.

Thus, on standard HPLC, they appear as one peak. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But looking at the options, none match this.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4 peaks in both
B) 2 standard, 3 chiral
C) 2 in both
D) 3 standard, 4 chiral.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two products, leading to four products in total.

Wait, but how? Each reaction produces a single diol.

Wait, no. Maybe the epoxide can form two different diastereomers upon ring opening. But in a symmetric epoxide, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps under acidic conditions, the epoxide can open in two different ways, leading to two diastereomers. But in a symmetric epoxide, both would be the same, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to two diastereomers, but that's only possible in asymmetric epoxides.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about the possible products.

Each reaction produces a diol. The diols from Reactions 1 and 2 are enantiomers.

So, in the combined mixture, you have two enantiomers.

So on standard HPLC (achiral), you get one peak (because enantiomers are not separated). On chiral HPLC, you get two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each diol has two stereocenters, and each reaction produces a meso compound. For example, if the diol is meso, then each reaction's product is a single compound, and the two reactions produce the same meso diol. Then, when combined, you have only one product.

But that would mean both Reactions 1 and 2 produce the same compound, which doesn't make sense because they started from enantiomers.

Wait, but maybe each diol is a meso compound. For example, if the diol has two stereocenters, but due to symmetry, it's meso.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol which is meso.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol which is meso.

So, both diols are the same meso compound. So when mixed, you have only one product.

In that case, both standard and chiral HPLC would show a single peak.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol with two stereocenters, but they're not meso, leading to two enantiomers.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps I should think about the possible options and see which one fits.

Option C says both standard and chiral HPLC show two peaks. That would imply that each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to four in total, but that's not possible with symmetric epoxides.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but under 100% completion, only one enantiomer is formed. Then, combining two enantiomers would lead to a racemic mixture.

But how does that affect the HPLC?

Wait, another thought: perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. For example, the epoxide could open in two different ways, leading to different diols.

But in a symmetric epoxide, the diol formed would be a single compound, not two.

Wait, perhaps the diol can form as a pair of enantiomers, but each reaction produces a single enantiomer.

So, when the products are combined, you have two enantiomers, which would show as two peaks on chiral HPLC and one peak on standard.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that each reaction produces two stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two products: the diol and another isomer. Let me think again.

Wait, but the problem says that both reactions go to 100% completion, so they each produce a single product.

So, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol, which is a single stereoisomer. Thus, Reaction 1: diol A, Reaction 2: diol B (enantiomer of A). So when combined, you have a racemic mixture.

In standard HPLC, one peak; chiral, two peaks.

But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to four products. But in that case, each reaction would produce two products, leading to four in total.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the epoxide can open in two different ways, leading to two different diols. But in a symmetric epoxide, the two would be the same, so only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is asymmetric, leading to two diastereomers upon ring-opening. But in our case, the epoxide is symmetric, so only one product.

I'm stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The key is to figure out how many peaks would each HPLC show.

If each reaction produces a single diol, and the two diols are enantiomers, then the combined mixture has two enantiomers.

Standard HPLC: 1 peak.

Chiral HPLC: 2 peaks.

But none of the options have that.

Looking at the options, the only one that could relate is option C: 2 peaks in both. So perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, and when combined, you have four.

But that would require each reaction to produce two products, which doesn't fit with the problem statement of 100% completion.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that can exist as two enantiomers, but each reaction produces a single enantiomer. Then, combining both would give two enantiomers.

But how does that translate to HPLC peaks?

In standard HPLC, they would co-elute as one peak. In chiral, two peaks.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, another possibility: each reaction produces two diastereomers. For example, the epoxide ring-opening leads to two diastereomers, but in a symmetric epoxide, only one is formed.

Wait, perhaps the diol has two stereocenters, but the molecule is meso, leading to a single product.

If that's the case, then both reactions would produce the same meso diol, leading to a single product.

Thus, in both HPLC columns, one peak.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the diol structures.

The diol from (E)-oct-4-ene would have hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration. The diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene would have hydroxyl groups on the same side, leading to a cis configuration.

But in a symmetric molecule, the trans diol would be a meso compound, while the cis diol would not be meso.

Wait, no. For example, 2,3-butanediol: the trans is meso, while the cis is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, yes. So, in that case, the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) is a meso compound, and the diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

For 2,3-butanediol, the cis is a meso compound, and the trans is a pair of enantiomers. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Let me clarify:

- If you have a diol with two adjacent stereocenters, the configuration can be:

a) Both hydroxyls on the same side (cis): this would be a meso compound if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. For example, 2,3-butanediol cis is meso.

b) Both hydroxyls on opposite sides: this would be a pair of enantiomers because the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry. For example, 2,3-butanediol trans exists as two enantiomers (R,R and S,S).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The trans-2,3-butanediol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a pair of enantiomers. The cis-2,3-butanediol would have the hydroxyls on the same side, which makes it a meso compound because of the plane of symmetry between the two central carbons.

So, for our problem:

- Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol which is trans, leading to a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no—because the diol from a symmetric trans-epoxide would be a meso compound. Wait, no, because the diol from a symmetric trans-epoxide would be a meso compound.

Wait, but if the diol is a meso compound, then it's achiral, so it would give a single peak on both HPLC columns.

Wait, but the diol from Reaction 1 (trans) is a meso compound, and the diol from Reaction 2 (cis) is a meso compound as well? No, because for the cis diol, it's a meso compound. Wait, no.

Wait, if the diol from Reaction 1 is trans, then it's a pair of enantiomers, unless it's meso.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think of specific examples.

Take 2,3-butanediol:

- Cis (both OH on same side): meso compound, so it's achiral. So, in Reaction 1, if the diol is cis, it's a single compound.

- Trans (OH on opposite sides): pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S), so the diol is chiral.

Wait, but wait: 2,3-butanediol cis is meso, while trans is a pair of enantiomers.

So, in our problem:

- Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol. The diol would be trans, so it's a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S), so it's chiral.

- Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol. The diol would be cis, which is a meso compound (achiral).

Wait, but that depends on the structure. If the diol is symmetric, like with even number of carbons, then the cis diol would be meso.

Wait, but in our case, the diol from Reaction 2 would have four carbons in between the two OH groups, making it symmetric and thus a meso compound.

So, Reaction 1: produces a pair of enantiomers (two peaks on chiral HPLC, one on standard), but the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion. So, perhaps each reaction produces only one enantiomer.

Wait, but in reality, when a symmetric epoxide opens, it leads to a single product. So, perhaps Reaction 1 produces a single enantiomer of the trans diol, and Reaction 2 produces a single meso compound.

Wait, but the meso compound is achiral, so in the HPLC, it would appear as a single peak regardless of the column.

Reaction 1 produces a chiral diol (but in a single enantiomer?), leading to a single peak on standard HPLC and two on chiral HPLC.

But the problem says both reactions complete 100%, so each reaction produces a single product.

So, Reaction 1: produces a single enantiomer of the trans diol (chiral), Reaction 2: produces a single meso compound (achiral).

Thus, the combined product mixture has two compounds: one chiral (enantiomer A) and one achiral (meso).

So, when run on standard HPLC (achiral), you would see two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the chiral diol.

But wait, no. Because the standard HPLC can't distinguish between enantiomers. So the chiral diol would appear as a single peak, and the meso as another, leading to two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, the chiral diol would split into two peaks (enantiomer A and its counterpart), while the meso remains as one peak. Thus, total of three peaks on chiral HPLC.

But that would mean standard HPLC has two peaks, chiral has three. Looking back at the options:

Option B) 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral.

So, the answer would be option B.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, Reaction 1 produces a chiral diol (trans), which is a single enantiomer. Reaction 2 produces a meso diol (cis), which is achiral.

So, the combined mixture has two compounds: a chiral diol and a meso diol.

When run on standard HPLC (achiral), the chiral diol would appear as one peak, and the meso as another. So two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, the chiral diol would split into two peaks (its enantiomer and the other), while the meso remains one. So total three peaks.

Thus, the answer is option B: 2 peaks in standard, 3 in chiral.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Both reactions go to 100% completion. The products are then analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each case.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1**:  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a **trans-epoxide**.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the trans-epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **trans-diol**.  
   - The trans-diol is a **chiral compound** with two stereocenters, and since the reaction goes to 100% completion, it forms a single enantiomer.

2. **Reaction 2**:  
   - (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a **cis-epoxide**.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the cis-epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **cis-diol**.  
   - The cis-diol is a **meso compound** (achiral) due to an internal plane of symmetry, and it forms as a single compound.

### Combined Product Mixture:
- The combined product mixture contains:
  1. A single enantiomer of the **trans-diol** (chiral).  
  2. A single compound of the **cis-diol** (meso, achiral).  

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
   - The achiral column cannot distinguish between enantiomers.  
   - The trans-diol (chiral) appears as a single peak, and the cis-diol (meso) appears as another single peak.  
   - **Total peaks: 2**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - The chiral column can separate enantiomers.  
   - The trans-diol (chiral) splits into two peaks (one for each enantiomer).  
   - The cis-diol (meso) appears as a single peak.  
   - **Total peaks: 3**.

### Conclusion:
The standard HPLC shows 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC shows 3 peaks. This matches **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
