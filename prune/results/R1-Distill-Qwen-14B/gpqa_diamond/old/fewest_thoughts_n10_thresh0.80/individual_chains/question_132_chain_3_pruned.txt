Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question involves a mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. Wait, let me think about that. Each compound individually must have a molecular formula that adds up to C10H14? Or wait, no, the mixture is 1:1. Oh, wait, no, each compound in the mixture must have a molecular formula C10H14 each? Because the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, and the molecular formula given is C10H14. So each compound is C10H14? Wait, that can't be right because if they're two different compounds, maybe one is C8H10 and the other is C2H4? No, that doesn't make sense because C10H14 implies each is that. Wait, no, wait: the solution has a mixture of two compounds, each of which is C10H14. So each is a C10H14 compound. So each of the two must be an aromatic compound with 10 carbons and 14 hydrogens.

Looking at the options: the options are four possible pairs. Let me check each compound's formula. Oh, wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is benzene with four methyl groups. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so adding four gives 6 + 4*1 = 10 carbons. Hydrogen: 6 (benzene) minus 4*(2) because each substitution removes a hydrogen (since benzene is C6H6, each substitution replaces one H). Wait, no, substitution replaces one H. So benzene has 6 H. Each substitution (like adding a methyl) replaces one H. So in tetramethylbenzene with four substituents, the number of H on benzene is 6 - 4 = 2. Each methyl group has 3 H. So 4 methyl groups contribute 4*3=12 H. So total H is 2 +12 = 14. So the formula is C10H14. Oh wait, benzene is C6H6, adding four methyl (CH3) groups: C6 +4C = C10. H6 minus 4 H (substituted) is 2 H. Plus 4*3=12 H from methyl: 2+12=14. Yep, so each of the tetramethylbenzenes in the options is C10H14. What about 1,4-diethylbenzene? Diethyl groups. Each ethyl is C2H5, so adding two would give benzene (C6) plus 2*2=4 carbons, so C10. Hydrogen: benzene has 6 H. Each substitution for ethyl (so two substitutions) removes 2 H. Benzene H: 6-2 =4. Each ethyl group has 5 H (since C2H5). So two ethyl groups:
