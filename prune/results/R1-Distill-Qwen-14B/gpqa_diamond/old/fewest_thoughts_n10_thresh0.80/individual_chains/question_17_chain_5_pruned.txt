Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex with a concentration of 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ in a complex. The formation constant, Kf, is a measure of how strong this complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

So, the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. I think this involves understanding the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since the complex is formed, most of the EDTA and calcium would be tied up in the complex, leaving a very low concentration of free Ca²+.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Since we're dealing with a solution where the complex is formed, we can model this using the Kf expression.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about what that implies about the concentrations of the individual ions.

In the complex, the stoichiometry is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-. So, when the complex dissociates, each molecule releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA⁴-.

But wait, no. Because the complex is already formed, the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- would be extremely low because Kf is so large (5e10). So the complex doesn't dissociate much.

Let me write out the equation. The reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ Ca-EDTA

The formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]) = 5e10.

At equilibrium, the concentration of Ca-EDTA is given as 0.02 M. But wait, wait, is that the initial concentration before any dissociation? Or is it the equilibrium concentration?

Wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about whether that's the initial concentration or the equilibrium.

Wait, when you prepare a solution, you add the complex, which is already formed. So, the initial concentration is 0.02 M. But then, the complex can dissociate a tiny bit. So, the initial assumption is that the complex is mostly intact because Kf is large, so very little dissociation occurs.

Let me set up the variables. Let's let the concentration of Ca²+ be x. Then, because the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of EDTA⁴- would also be x. Because for every Ca²+ ion released, an EDTA⁴- is released.

Wait, no. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, if x is the amount of complex that dissociates, then:

[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. But since Kf is large, x will be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Similarly, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA⁴-] = x.

So, substituting into the Kf expression:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, that's the equation. So, solving
