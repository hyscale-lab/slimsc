Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see, the question involves a series of reactions leading to a product, and I need to figure out the structure of the major isomer.

First, the starting material is cyclooctatetraene. I remember that cyclooctatetraene is a cyclic molecule with eight carbons and four double bonds. It's a non-aromatic compound, kind of like a strained cyclopropane but bigger. When heated, I think it might undergo some kind of rearrangement or addition reaction.

The first step is heating cyclooctatetraene with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1. Maleic anhydride is a dienophile, right? So I'm thinking about dienophiles and the Diels-Alder reaction. Oh wait, but cyclooctatetraene isn't a diene; it's a conjugated cyclic diene but maybe it can react as a diene in some way. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing a [4+2] cycloaddition with maleic anhydride.

Wait, wait. Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile. Cyclooctatetraene has four double bonds, but in a ring. I think it can react with a dienophile like maleic anhydride. So maybe it's adding maleic anhydride across two of its double bonds? Or perhaps it's undergoing a ring-opening or some other addition.

Wait, another thought: cyclooctatetraene is a strained molecule. When heated, it might undergo ring-opening to form something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting as a diene. Let me think: the Diels-Alder reaction requires a diene (four conjugated carbons)
