Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm and three singlets around 2.2 ppm. The ratios are 1:1 for the aromatic signals and 2:1:1 for the aliphatic signals.

Hmm, let's break this down. The molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think about the possible structures. Since both are aromatic compounds, they likely have a benzene ring with substituents. Each substituent would probably be a methyl group because that would account for the aliphatic signals.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So each substituent is probably a methyl group because (C6 + 4*CH3) would be C10H14. Because 6 + 4*1 = 10 carbons, and 6 hydrogens from benzene plus 4*(3) = 18, but wait, benzene is C6H6, so each substituent is methyl, each adding one C and three H. Let me check: each substituent is a methyl group. So the number of substituents would be 4, because 6 +4=10, but wait, wait. Let me recalculate. C10H14: benzene is C6H6. Each substituent is a methyl (CH3). So each substituent adds one C and 3 H. Let's see: 6 + n = 10 → n=4 substituents. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene.

But wait, looking at the options, some are tetramethyl and one is diethyl. Option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me think: 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. So each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H5(C2H5)2 → C6+4=10, H: 5*2 (each ethyl has 5 H?) Wait, no, benzene is C6H5, each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyl groups give 2*(2H in the ring? Wait, no, wait: the benzene ring with two ethyl groups would be C6H5-(CH2CH3)2. So molecular formula would be C6 + 2*(C2H5) → C6+4= C10, H: 5 (benzene has 5 H? Wait, benzene has 6 H, but when you attach substituents, each ethyl group would take a H. So benzene would lose two H (since two substituents), so 6-2=4 H in the ring. Each ethyl group has 5 H (since CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H?), but wait, wait, each ethyl is -CH2
