Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, expectation values, right? I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that quantity many times on identically prepared systems.

So, the expectation value formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So in this case, O is 10σz +5σx. So I'll need to compute the expectation of each part separately and then add them.

Wait, but σz and σx are Pauli matrices. Their eigenvalues are known. For σz, the eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ correspond to +1 and -1, respectively. So when I compute ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩, that should be straightforward because the state is a combination of σz eigenstates.

Let me break this down. The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me first compute the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities times their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, the probability of measuring spin-up is |0.5|^2, which is 0.25, and spin-down is |sqrt(3)/2|^2. Let me compute that. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.25 for up, 0.75 for down. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10σz would contribute 10 * (-0.5) = -5 to the expectation value.

Now I need to find the expectation value of σx. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier because its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Wait, the eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are equal superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So I might need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

Alternatively, I can write the operator σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. I remember that σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply σx to |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩, and vice versa.

So let's compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me write ψ as a column vector. If |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], then ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

So σx acting on ψ would flip the spin, right? So σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Let me compute σx |ψ⟩. That would be (0.5 σx |↑⟩ ) + (sqrt(3)/2 σx |↓⟩ ) = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

So then ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ† and (σx |ψ⟩).

Calculating it: [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] multiplied by [ [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ]^T ]? Wait, no, the inner product is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] times [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ]?

Wait, let me get the vectors straight. The state ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So the bra ⟨ψ| is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ].

So when you multiply ⟨ψ| (which is [0.5* (0.5), (sqrt(3)/2)* (sqrt(3)/2)] ) ) and σx |ψ⟩, which is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Wait, let me think again. σx |ψ⟩ is 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩, so in vector terms, that's [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

So the inner product is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So that's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Wait, because 0.5* is 0.5 (since real numbers here), and same with sqrt(3)/2.

So first term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = same as above, so (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330.

Adding them together gives (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because when I compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I should check if that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute it using the components.

Alternatively, the expectation value can be calculated using the formula <σx> = |a|^2 * a' + |b|^2 * b' + cross terms, but wait, maybe a better approach is to use the matrix representation.

Let me compute ψ† σx ψ. Since σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], then ψ† σx is [0.5* (0), 0.5* (1), (sqrt(3)/2)* (1), (sqrt(3)/2)* (0) ]? Wait, maybe it's easier to compute ψ† multiplied by σx, then multiplied by ψ.

Alternatively, ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so the inner product is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5. Which is (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

So yes, that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So now, the operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation value is 10 * ⟨σz⟩ +5 * ⟨σx⟩.

We had ⟨σz⟩ as -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) is -5.

⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 5 * 0.8660 is approximately 4.33.

So adding together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh wait, no, 0.8660 times 5 is approximately 4.33. So total is (-5) +4.3
