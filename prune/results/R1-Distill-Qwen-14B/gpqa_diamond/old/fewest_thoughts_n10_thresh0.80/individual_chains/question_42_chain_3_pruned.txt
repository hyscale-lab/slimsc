Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that the TTV method is something to do with transit timing variations, but I'm not sure how that factors into this problem. Oh well, maybe it's not directly relevant here. Let's look at the details.

The question gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, Planet1's equilibrium temperature is higher than Planet2, and Planet2's is higher than Planet3. That suggests that Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2, and Planet2 is closer than Planet3. Because equilibrium temperature usually depends on the distance from the star, right?

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something I should recall. Oh, right! The equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet is given by the equation: Te = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) )^0.25 ), but actually, a more simplified version when the star's luminosity is constant is Te ∝ (L)^(1/4) / d^(1/2). But wait, since L is the same for all planets around the same star, the ratio of their temperatures would depend on the inverse square root of their distances.

So, if Te1/Te2 is 1.4, then (d2/d1)^(0.5) = 1.4. Wait, no, because Te is inversely proportional to the square root of distance. So, Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^(0.5). Because if d is bigger, Te is smaller. So, rearranging, d2 = d1 * (Te1/Te2)^2. Wait, let me think again.

The equilibrium temperature formula can be written as Te = (L/(16πσd²))^0.25 * ( (1 - a) )^0.25, where a is albedo. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that term is the same for all, so we can ignore it for the ratio.

So, (Te1)/(Te2) = sqrt( d2 / d1 )^0.5? Or wait, wait. Let me get the formula correctly. The correct formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = [ ( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 π σ d^2) ]^0.25

So, if we take the ratio between two planets, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 )^0.5? Wait, let me compute the ratio:

Te1/Te2 = [ ( (1 - a)L )/(16πσ d1²) ]^0.25 / [ same with d2² ]

So, Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Because when you divide the two, d1² in denominator of Te1 and d2² in Te2,
