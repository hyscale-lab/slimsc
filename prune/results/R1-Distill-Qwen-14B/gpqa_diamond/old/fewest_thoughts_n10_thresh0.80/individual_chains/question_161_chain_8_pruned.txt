Okay, so there's this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operated at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, below 1e-9 Torr. But despite that, some gas particles are still present, and the mass spectrometer detected them. So, he calculated the mean free path as λ1. Mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules, right?

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, and this happens even though the temperature is the same as before. So, the question is why λ2 is different from λ1. What could cause the mean free path to change under the electron beam?

Wait, mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In a vacuum, gas molecules would collide with each other and with the chamber walls. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecule, and P pressure. But wait, another formula I remember is λ = (1)/(n * π * d²/4), where n is the number density. Oh right, because n is P/(k*T), so both formulas are connected.

So, if the pressure is lower, the mean free path is longer. That makes sense because in a vacuum, the fewer molecules there are, the less frequent collisions, so each molecule travels further on average.

But in this case, when Mike starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes. The pressure and temperature are the same, so why would λ change? Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas somehow. Electrons are being shot through the system, but how would that influence the gas molecules?

Oh! The electron beam is a source of energy. Maybe the electrons collide with the gas molecules, causing them to ionize or get excited. Or perhaps the beam provides additional energy, increasing the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. If the gas molecules become ionized, they might behave differently. For instance, charged particles could stick to the walls of the chamber or be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, leading to
