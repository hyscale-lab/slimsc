Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, it's looking for the relationship per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each giving a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula, as I recall, is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance. Parallax decreases as distance increases. Oh right, parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So if a star is twice as far away, its parallax is half as much.

Now, the problem says number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So if I let N be the number of stars, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, where d is the distance, I can substitute that in. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that: the denominator is (1/d)^5, so the reciprocal is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, I think I need to find the derivative of N with respect to d to find the rate of change.

Wait, the number of stars in a region depends on the volume, right? Because more volume can hold more stars. Oh, but wait, wait. The question says the number varies with parallax, but perhaps this is considering a certain area, so we're looking at how the count within a distance shell changes. Let's think about it.

If we're considering a thin shell between distance r and r + dr, the volume of that shell is 4πr² dr. But wait, if the number of stars in a region depends on parallax, which is inversely proportional to distance, then the number density (stars per unit volume) would be some function of distance.

But maybe I should approach it differently. Since N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5. But we're looking for the change in N per unit distance, so the derivative dN/dr would be proportional to the derivative of d^5 with respect to d. The derivative of d^5 is 5d^4. So dN/dr ∝ d^4.

But wait, the options are in terms of r, not d. Oh, wait, r here is the distance. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me go through it again. N varies as 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d. So N = k * (d)^5, where k is the proportionality constant. So the number of stars increases with d^5. So if you go from d to d+dr, the number increases by k*( (d+dr)^5 - d^5 ). But when dr is small, the change is approximately 5 d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance is dN/dr = 5 k d^4. So this is proportional to d^4, which is r^4 (since r is the distance). So the correct answer is option C, r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this relationship into the equation for \( N \), we find \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5 \). Thus, \( N \) is proportional to \( d^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \): 

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto \frac{d}{dr}(d^5) = 5d^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( d^4 \), or equivalently \( r^4 \) (since \( r \) represents distance). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
