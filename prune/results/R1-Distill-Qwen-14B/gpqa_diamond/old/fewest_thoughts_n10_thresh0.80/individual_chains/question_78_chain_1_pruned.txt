Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges are moving, the potentials aren't just the static case anymore. Let me try to think through this.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated at time tr (the retarded time) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. And we need to find expressions for V and A at time t, where t > tr.

Wait, so the potentials are retarded. That means we use the positions and velocities of the charge at an earlier time tr, which is the time it takes for the field to reach the observer. Right, because electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light.

I remember that the scalar potential V for a moving charge isn't just q/(4πε₀ r) anymore. Because when the charge is moving, the fields are affected. Oh wait, but wait, the scalar potential might still have a similar form, but with some correction due to the motion.

And the vector potential A is generally related to the charge's motion. I think A is proportional to the velocity v of the charge. Oh right, the vector potential for a moving charge involves the velocity term.

Let me recall the general expressions. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (v t)/c²)), something like that. Or wait, no, maybe it's based on the retarded time. So the distance at the retarded time would be d = r - (v tr)/c² or something similar. Hmm, not exactly sure.

Wait, the retarded time tr is such that the position of the charge at time tr is s(tr), and the vector d is r - s(tr). Because the field at r is due to the charge's position and velocity at tr.

So the scalar potential V(r, t) is (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1 over (d + (v × (t - tr))/c²) or something like that. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * 1/(|d| - (v · d)/c² + (v · v) t_r / c² )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, option C and D have expressions where V has q multiplied by c in the numerator, and denominators have terms like d c minus or plus the dot product of d and v.

Wait, let's start fresh. For a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / [ r' - (v t)/c² ] )

But r' is the position at the retarded time. Wait, but how does that translate into the given variables?

Alternatively, the correct expressions for V and A are:
