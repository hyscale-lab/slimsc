Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are called enantiomers and they're a type of stereoisomer. So the question is asking which of the given organic moieties show this property.

The question lists four options: 1,2,3,4. And the choices are A, B, C, D with different combinations.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.** Biphenyl structures can have different conformations. Wait, but does this compound have a stereocenter? Let's see. The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond), with substituents. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. Also, nitro groups at 6 and 6'. The central bond is a single bond, so the two rings can rotate. But wait, if there are groups that make the two halves different, then maybe the biphenyl could have some kind of stereochemistry.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element like a plane or axis. Let me think about this. If the substituents on the two phenyl rings are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe rotation isn't possible, leading to enantiomers.

Alternatively, biphenyls can have axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when a single bond connects two chiral parts, like in binaphthyl compounds. So if the substituents on both rings are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. I'm trying to visualize the structure. The nitro groups are on the same side? Or opposite? Wait, the positions are 6,6' dinitro, so on each benzene ring, the nitro is at position 6. The other substituents are at 2 and 2', which are on the same ring as the nitro?

Wait, maybe the structure is [1,1'-
