Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. The question is: what's the angle between the directions of the photons?

Hmm. Right, so annihilate into two photons. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. And since they are an electron and a positron, their masses are the same. Oh wait, but wait, Lorentz factors are given, so their energies are not just the rest mass energy but more.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about conservation laws here. Since the electron and positron are annihilating into two photons, energy and momentum must be conserved.

So, let's consider energy and momentum conservation.

First, let's think about the initial momenta of the electron and positron. Because each has a Lorentz factor, gamma. The Lorentz factor gamma is equal to the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So, for each particle, the total energy is gamma * m_0 c^2, and the momentum is gamma * m_0 v. But wait, v is the speed. Alternatively, since for a relativistic particle, the momentum is gamma m_0 v, but v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Because (gamma)^-2 = 1 - (v^2/c^2). So, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma. I remember that for a particle, the momentum p = gamma m_0 v. And since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2), substituting that in:

p = gamma m_0 c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 ) 

But wait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, I can express p in terms of gamma and m_0. Let me think. The relation between energy and momentum is E^2 = (pc c)^2
