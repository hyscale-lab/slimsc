Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here where I need to identify an unknown compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's see how I can approach this.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The problem states that there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So this compound likely has a carboxylic acid group because they have strong, broad O-H stretches. The other peak at 1700 cm^-1 probably corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have that around 1700, so that fits.

Now onto the 1H NMR. The problem says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So we can eliminate any possibility of double bondsâ€”no alkenes in the structure. That means all the structures are either single bonds or maybe something else but no vinyl groups.

Looking at the options provided, all of them have a COOH group (since they end with COOH), so that's consistent with the IR.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that sounds complicated. Let me think about what that implies. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring hydrogens. So each split corresponds to coupling with adjacent Hs.

Let me consider the possible structures. Let's look at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, I should probably draw the structures to visualize better.

Option D is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central part is a structure where two adjacent carbons each have a CH group with another substituent. Each of those CH groups would have two substituents: one CH3 and another CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me parse it correctly.

Wait, the formula for each option is a bit tricky. Let me think:

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the central part is a four-carbon chain? Wait, no: starting from the COOH, it's -COOH attached to a CH group, which is attached to another CH group, which is attached to a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine each structure.

Take Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the backbone is CH2CH3 connected to a CH that's connected to another CH that's connected to COOH. So the two middle CH groups each have a CH3 and are connected to each other. So the structure around the middle is like CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the two middle CHs are each connected to a CH3 and another CH group.

In such a case, the two middle CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups and adjacent to each other. So each of these CH groups would have neighboring Hs. Let's think about the splitting.

Each of the two central CH (let's call them CHa and CHb) would have two neighboring CH groups. Wait, no: CHa is connected to CH2CH3 and CHb; CHb is connected to CHa and COOH. So each CH group is adjacent to another CH group. So each CH has two Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe the splitting is because each CH group's H is coupling with the Hs on the adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal coupling? No, geminal coupling is rare because Hs on the same carbon don't split each other (except in geminal diads, but that's usually not observed in 1H NMR except in specific cases like when there's a splitting due to coupling with another nucleus, like J coupling in some cases, but I think that's not the case here).

Wait, perhaps each CH group has neighboring groups that have multiple Hs. For instance, in the structure, each CH is adjacent to a CH2CH3 (if that's the case) or other groups.

Wait, let me think of the structure more clearly. For option D: The molecule is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the two CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and are next to each other. So each CH has two Hs (since it's a CH group). Each of these CHs is adjacent to another CH. So each H on the CHa would be next to the Hs on CHb. But wait, each CH group has two Hs, so each H on CHa would be coupling with each H on CHb. So for each H on CHa, it would be a doublet from coupling with the two Hs on CHb. Because each H on CHa is adjacent to two Hs on CHb, each of which would split into a doublet. Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Each H is coupled with the Hs on the adjacent carbon. So each CHa H is next to two Hs on CHb. So each H in CHa would be
