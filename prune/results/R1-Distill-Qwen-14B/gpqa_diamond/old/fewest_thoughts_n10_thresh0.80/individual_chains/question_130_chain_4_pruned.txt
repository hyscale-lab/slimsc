Okay, so I have this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and when their light passes through intergalactic medium, like these clouds of hydrogen, some wavelengths get absorbed. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is involved here. 

Wait, what's the Lyman-alpha wavelength? I think the Lyman series is for hydrogen and the Lyman-alpha line is the transition from n=2 to n=1. The wavelength should be around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, if the quasar is at a high redshift, the wavelength we observe would be stretched due to the expansion of the universe. 

The question is about the lower limit on the redshift so that these clouds can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, right! Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because our atmosphere blocks it. So the absorbed light has to shift into the optical range for us to detect it from the ground.

So the Lyman-alpha wavelength is ~1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nm. Optical light is from about 400 nm to 700 nm, I think. So the observed wavelength needs to be at least 400 nm for ground-based telescopes to see it.

The redshift formula is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength. So we can set the observed wavelength to
