Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC for short. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think Li is lithium, right? So lithium-6 maybe? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 6. So X is Li-6.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I need to be careful about that.

The speed is given as 0.96c, so that's pretty fast, relativistic speeds. So I should use the relativistic equations here. The first thing I think about is the gamma factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's calculate that.

v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me recheck that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, maybe exactly 1/(sqrt(0.0784))—since 0.0784 is 784e-4, the square root is 28e-2, so yes, 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Let me calculate it more accurately. Let's compute 0.96^2. 0.96 * 0.96: 0.96 is 96/100. 96 squared is 9216. So 9216/10000, which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784: let me think, since 0.28^2 is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 =
