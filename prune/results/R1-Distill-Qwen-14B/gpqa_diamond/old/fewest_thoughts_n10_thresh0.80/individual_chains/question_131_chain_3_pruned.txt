Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack what's going on.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has an NMR spectrum with some specific peaks. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products. The major and minor products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. The NOESY NMR data show a cross-peak in the major product but not the minor. The question is about identifying which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I think I need to figure out the structure of the starting anhydride and then the reaction.

The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride. The fact that the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm suggests that maybe the protons are all equivalent in some way. Wait, 7 ppm is a region where aromatic protons usually appear, but that might not be the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, but more likely, it's an aromatic ring. But wait, if it's an anhydride from a diacid, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride, like a maleic anhydride or similar.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about what carbons those could be. 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl. 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon (like ketone or ester or anhydride). So, maybe the anhydride has two carbonyl groups. Since the 1H NMR has only one peak, perhaps the protons are in a symmetrical arrangement. So, perhaps the anhydride is symmetric, so all equivalent protons would show as a single peak.

Wait, another possibility: if the anhydride has two equivalent carbonyl groups and the protons are all the same. For example, if it's a cyclic anhydride with two ester groups and the protons are symmetrically placed.

But wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. So maybe the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond. Wait, no. Wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but no, that's just single bonds. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond somewhere. Hmm, maybe the diacid is HO
