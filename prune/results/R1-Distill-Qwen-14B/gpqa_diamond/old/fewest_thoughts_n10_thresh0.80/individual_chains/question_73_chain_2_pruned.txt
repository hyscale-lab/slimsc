Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't apply, and we need to use special relativity instead. 

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We're supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in special relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities. Oh right, you can't just do v1 - v2 because that would give a speed greater than c, which isn't possible. So I think the formula for relative velocity is different. Let me recall: the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, I should plug in the velocities correctly.

So astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, the relative speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c^2)]. Let me compute that.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, actually, in this case, we need to find the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's perspective, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c^2)).

Wait, that's ( -0.1c ) / (1 - (0.3c²)/(c²)) ) which is (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is positive, it's 0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14
