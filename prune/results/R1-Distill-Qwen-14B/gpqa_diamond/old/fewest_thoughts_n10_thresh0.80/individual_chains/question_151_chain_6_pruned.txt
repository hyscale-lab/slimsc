Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's a vector with three components. So this must be a qutrit system, right? Because qubit is two states, qutrit is three. Or maybe it's just a three-dimensional vector in some Hilbert space.

Then, there's this observable P, which is a matrix operator. The matrix has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I think I should write this down to visualize it better.

So matrix P looks like this:

[ 0    1/√2   0 ]
[1/√2  0    1/√2]
[ 0    1/√2   0 ]

I remember that observables are Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes. Let me quickly check if P is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of P should equal P itself. Since all the elements are real here, the (i,j) element should equal the (j,i) element. Let me see:

- P[1,2] is 1/√2, and P[2,1] is also 1/√2. Same for P[1,3] and P[3,1], but wait no, P[1,3] is 0, and P[3,1] is 0. Oh wait, wait, no, P[2,3] is 1/√2, and P[3,2] is 1/√2. So yes, it's symmetric, so it's Hermitian. Good.

The question is about finding the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. I think this involves finding the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then projecting the system's state onto those eigenvectors to find the probability.

Wait, but wait a second. How do I find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P? Let me think. The eigenvalues are the possible outcomes of the measurement, so the possible values are the eigenvalues of P. We're interested in the probability that the outcome is 0, so I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector's direction.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues of P. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0. Let's compute that.

The matrix (P - λ I) would be:

[ -λ    1/√2    0 ]
[1/√2  -λ    1/√2]
[ 0    1/√2   -λ ]

The determinant of this 3x3 matrix should be zero. Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 can be a bit tricky, but let's proceed.

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * det( [ -λ   1/√2 ]
           [1/√2  -λ ] )

- 1/√2 * det( [1/√2   1/√2 ]
               [0      -λ ] )

+ 0 * det(..., which is zero.

Wait, wait, no. The cofactor expansion for the first row is:

-λ * det(minor at (1,1)) - (1/√2) * det(minor at (1,2)) + 0 * det(minor at (1,3)).

So minor at (1,1) is
