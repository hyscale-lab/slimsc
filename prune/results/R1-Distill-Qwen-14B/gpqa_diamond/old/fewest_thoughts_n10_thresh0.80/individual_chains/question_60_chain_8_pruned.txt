Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to understand what's being asked.

So, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud—they have a really fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years. They want to reach Earth, and the astronaut is 22 years old. The question is, how long will the trip take from the astronaut's point of view? And the options are whether they'll die before getting there, or how many years it will take from their perspective.

Hmm, okay, so I think this is a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation. When you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs, meaning that time moves slower for the traveler relative to a stationary observer.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I get the question right. The question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, right? So from their perspective, the trip would take less time than from Earth's perspective because of the effects of relativity.

Wait, no, no—wait, the question says, from the point of view of the astronaut, how long will it take. So it's about proper time, the time measured in the moving frame, which in this case is the astronaut's frame.

But I'm a bit confused. So the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 c, which is really close to the speed of light. So the distance to the Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud—wait, wait, what's the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth?

I remember the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and it's about 160,000 light-years away. Wait, or is it about 160,000? No, I think it's approximately 163,000 light-years, but maybe I should double-check. But for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that the distance is about 160,000 light-years.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 c. So from Earth's perspective,
