Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a monobasic strong acid. They're asking for two things: the minimum volume of a 0.1 M acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so when it reacts with a strong acid, it should form a salt and water. The acid is monobasic, which means it donates one H+ ion, like HCl or HNO3. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 H+ ions (since Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups) to form Fe³+ and 3 H2O.

Let me write the reaction out:
Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O

Right. So first, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass will help with that. 

Fe has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles, which is about 9.36e-4 mol.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 106.85 is correct. So 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.0009359 mol. So roughly 0.000936 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:3 between Fe(OH)3 and H+, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times that. So 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol of H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter. To find the volume of acid needed, I'll use the formula:

Molarity = moles / volume (in liters)
So volume = moles / Molarity.

Moles needed are 0.002808 mol. Molarity is 0.1 M. So volume in liters is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait
