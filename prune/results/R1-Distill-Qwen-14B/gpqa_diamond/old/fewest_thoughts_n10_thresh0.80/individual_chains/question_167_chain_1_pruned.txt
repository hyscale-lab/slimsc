Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that the relative entropy here is defined as del_b, which is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and that of the reference Gaussian state tau. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

The state in question is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). So for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, I should compute N first.

Let's plug in the values. Phi is -pi/4, so 2 phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. And exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 ≈ 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

Wait, but wait a second. N is the normalization, so the state is correctly normalized. Now, the state is |psi> = [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>]/N. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state is (0.7071|0.5> -0.7071|−0.5>)/0.627.

Wait, but the state is a superposition of coherent states with opposite phases. Coherent states are Gaussian states, but their superposition can be non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is a non-Gaussian state, and the reference state tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a coherent state or maybe the average of the two?

But the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. Usually, when calculating non-Gaussianity relative to a Gaussian state, one might take the closest Gaussian state as the reference. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes the reference is the completely mixed state, but in this case, it's a Gaussian state.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what the reference Gaussian state tau is. The problem states tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the most similar Gaussian state to rho. Alternatively, maybe it's the vacuum or a coherent state. But without more specific information, perhaps I need to make an assumption. Or maybe the reference state is the Gaussian state that is closest to the non-Gaussian state in some sense, like the one that minimizes the relative entropy.

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating this. Let me think about how to approach this calculation.

First, I need to
