Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

So, the problem says a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at time t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. Then, it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where Φ0 is π/4 and U0 is 190 kV. We need to find out how many revolutions the proton makes.

Hmm, I remember that in cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. But synchrocyclotrons are a bit different because they have a varying magnetic field, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Synchrocyclotrons are like modified cyclotrons where the magnetic field increases with time. That's so that the particles can keep moving in the same orbit as their mass increases (well, relativistic mass, actually). So the magnetic field B(t) increases as the particle's momentum increases.

Wait, but in this problem, the voltage is given as a function of time. So perhaps the acceleration comes from the electric field generated by this voltage. The voltage is alternating, so the electric field alternates direction, which makes the particles accelerate each half-cycle, I think. 

The question is about the number of revolutions. Revolutions would be linked to how long the proton spends in the accelerator and how much time it takes to gain the kinetic energy of 950 MeV. So I need to find the time taken and then relate that to the number of revolutions.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating voltage is related to the revolution frequency of the particle. Oh, right, because the particles are moving in a circle, and the electric field must be applied in phase with their position. So the condition is that the electric field is zero at the point where the particle is, and non-zero when it's moving through the gap. So the voltage is applied in a way that the time between applications is synchronized with the particle's orbital period.

Wait, but the formula provided is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Hmm, ν(α) is probably the frequency that depends on the particle's motion, which might be related to the revolution frequency. So maybe ν(α) is the revolution frequency f, so that the electric field is applied every time the proton comes around?

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the basic equations.

In a cyclotron, the particles move in a magnetic field, and the acceleration happens in the gaps between the dees. The frequency of the applied voltage must match the particle's cyclotron frequency. So the cyclotron frequency is f = (qB)/(2πm). But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field increases, the frequency of the applied voltage must change as well. Oh right, because as the proton gains energy, its velocity increases, but the magnetic
