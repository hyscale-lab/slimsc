Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me. It's about identifying a compound using IR and NMR spectroscopy. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's look at the IR data. The strong bands are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are in the range for N-H stretches. Wait, but those are two bands close together. Maybe it's an amide? Because amides typically show two N-H stretches due to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, possibly an ester or amide. Esters usually have a carbonyl around 1720-1740, while amides are a bit lower, like 1650-1700. Wait, but this is 1720, so maybe it's an ester. Or maybe a formamide? Because formamide's carbonyl is around 1680-1700, but sometimes can be higher. Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR now. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's list them:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something that splits into a triplet. Like OCH2CH3 or something else where the ethyl is adjacent to an electronegative atom.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be an NH2 group? But it's a singlet and broad, maybe it's an NH that's exchanging, like in an amide. Or maybe a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, but the broadness makes me think of something like an amine or amide.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet, so maybe adjacent to a CH2 that's split into a quartet. Oh, wait, the ethyl group at 1.20 is a triplet, so maybe the CH2 in the middle is at 4.5. So like OCH2CH2... Wait, but 4.5 for a quartet suggests coupling with another CH2. Hmm, maybe an ester group? Like OCH2 connected to another CH2.

Wait, the 4.5 ppm quartet might be a -O-CH2-CO- group. Because ethyl esters usually have the CH2O at around 4.1-4.3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-N- group, but then why the quartet?

Let me think about the aromatic region next. 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituents are opposite each other, like in para positions. So what substituents would cause that? For example, if it's an ester group like OCH2CH3 attached to a benzene ring, maybe in the para position. Or maybe an amide group, like Ph-CO-NH2, but then the NMR would show different shifts.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees: probably a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond (another 1). So likely a benzene ring plus an ester or amide group.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: Benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents are at meta positions. But the NMR shows a para substitution (two doublets). So maybe this isn't correct.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: Formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the substituents are at para positions. The ethoxy is at position 4, and the formamide at position 1 (assuming numbering). Wait, but formamide is HCO-NHR, so in this case, the R is phenyl with ethoxy at para.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure: Phenyl group with NH2 at position 4, and a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, or is it the other way? Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So as a propiono-phenyl group. Alternatively, it's a phenyl group connected to a propanoate ester. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: Benzoate ester, with ethyl group as the ester. The benzoate would have a COOEt group, and the amino group at para. So, the substituents are 4-amino and the ester at position 1 (if numbering starts from the COOEt group).

Now, let's analyze each option with the spectra.

Option D:
