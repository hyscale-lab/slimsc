Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question says: We have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options provided.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means two substituents are attached to the benzene ring. The ring is six-membered, so that's the benzene ring itself. The total carbon atoms are 8, so the substituents must contribute 2 carbons because the benzene has 6 carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the benzene ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents add to that. So if the total is 8, the substituents must add 2 more carbons. So each substituent must be a group with one carbon each, but wait, maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is one? Or maybe one substituent is a group with two carbons. Wait, but wait, let me think again.

Wait, the ring has six carbons. The substituents are two groups attached to the ring. So if the total is 8, then the substituents contribute 8 -6 = 2 carbons in total. So that would mean each substituent is a one-carbon group, but that's not possible because each substituent would have to be something like a methyl group, but that's two substituents each of one carbon. But wait, wait, no. Wait, substituents can be more complex. Or perhaps one substituent is a larger group. Hmm.

Wait, the substituents have to add up to 2 carbons. So let's think about possible substituents. The IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O), so one substituent must be a carbonyl-containing group. The other substituent has an aromatic-halogen bond, so that's a halogen attached to the ring. So, substituents are a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.) and a carbonyl group, perhaps as an acyl group.

Wait, but the carbonyl could be part of a ketone
