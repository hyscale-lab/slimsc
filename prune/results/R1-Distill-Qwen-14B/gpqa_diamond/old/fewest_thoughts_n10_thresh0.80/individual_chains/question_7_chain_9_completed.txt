Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question is asking: From what energy do gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited by this process gamma-gamma -> e+ e-? The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are in the order of 1e4 to 1e5 GeV, which is really high energy. 

I remember that when a high-energy photon interacts with a lower-energy photon, they can produce electron-positron pairs if the combined energy is enough. This is related to the threshold energy required. So the process here is gamma (high energy) plus CMB photon (low energy) annihilating into an electron-positron pair.

I think the threshold condition for pair production is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least equal to twice the rest mass energy of the electron. Because each electron (or positron) has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV. So for pair production, the total energy needs to be at least 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, this is in the rest frame of the system, right?

Wait, but in the lab frame, where the CMB photon is much lower energy than the gamma-ray, how do we calculate the threshold condition? I remember something about the center of mass energy needing to be at least 2m_e c².

So let's set up the scenario. The gamma photon has energy E_gamma, and the CMB photon has energy E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. But wait, CMB photons are typically about 0.001 eV each because the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K, which corresponds to a photon energy of k_B * T ~ 1e-3 eV.

Wait, but when dealing with photon interactions, the energy in the center of mass (CM) frame must reach the threshold of 2 * m_e c². So the combined energy in the CM frame must be equal to 1.022 MeV. So I need to calculate the gamma-ray energy where this condition is met.

Let me recall the formula for the threshold energy. The threshold occurs when the energy in the CM frame is just enough to produce the pair. The formula for the minimum energy of the high-energy photon (gamma) needed for this process is given by:

E_gamma = ( (2 m_e c^2) )^2 / (4 E_cmb) )

Wait, or maybe I should think about the invariant quantity, the Mandelstam variable s. For two photons colliding, s is the square of the total energy in the CM frame.

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2

But photons are massless, so their energy and momentum are related by E = pc. Also, if they are moving in opposite directions (like a head-on collision), their momenta are opposite. So let me model this: the two photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta are p1 and p2. Wait, but since their energies are E1 and E2, their momenta are E1/c and E2/c, respectively. But because they're moving in opposite directions, the vector sum is (E1/c - E2/c) if one is moving in positive and the other negative direction.

Wait, but for the invariant s, which is (sum energy)^2 - (sum momentum * c)^2.

So sum energy is E1 + E2.

Sum momentum is (E1/c in +x) + (E2/c in -x) ) = (E1 - E2)/c.

So sum momentum squared is [ (E1 - E2)/c ]^2 c^2 = (E1 - E2)^2.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expanding this: (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2.

At threshold, s must be equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2, because that's the rest mass of the produced pair.

So 4 E_gamma * E_cmb = (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Solving for E_gamma:

E_gamma = ( (2 m_e c^2)^2 ) / (4 E_cmb )

Simplify:

E_gamma = (4 (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (4 E_cmb ) ) = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

So E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

Now, let's compute this.

m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, which is 511,000 eV.

E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma = (511,000 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = ?

Let me calculate that.

First, (511,000)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61121e11 (eV)^2.

Divide by 1e-3 eV:

2.61121e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61121e14 eV.

Wait, that's 2.61e14 eV. Let me convert that to GeV.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV.

So 2.61e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, that's 2.61 * 1e5 GeV, which is 2.61e5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. I used E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb. Yes, because s must be (2 m_e c^2)^2, which is 4 (m_e c^2)^2, and s = 4 E_gamma E_cmb. So 4 E_gamma E_cmb = (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / (E_cmb).

Yes, that's correct.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, we analyze the threshold condition for pair production. The process requires the combined energy of the gamma-ray and a CMB photon to be at least equal to twice the rest mass energy of the electron, $2m_e c^2 = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$. 

The invariant quantity $s$, which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame, must satisfy:

\[
s = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}
\]

Here, $E_\gamma$ is the energy of the gamma-ray, and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ is the energy of the CMB photon. Solving for $E_\gamma$ gives:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4E_{\text{CMB}}}
\]

Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}$ and $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
\]

First, calculate $(511,000)^2 = 2.61121 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2$. Then divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{11}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Convert to GeV by dividing by $10^9$:

\[
E_\gamma = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} / 10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV} = 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This result matches option C, $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.

Answer: C
