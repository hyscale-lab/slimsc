Okay, so I've got this question here about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember that when neutral hydrogen is in large clouds, they can absorb certain wavelengths of light from background objects like quasars. The question mentions the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, Lyman alpha is the transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from the second to the first energy level, right? And that's in the ultraviolet range. So the wavelength is around 121.6 nm, but the question says 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. Yeah, that makes sense.

The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm. So I think redshift has to do with how much the wavelength of the light is stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The higher the redshift, the more the light is shifted to longer wavelengths.

Wait, the Lyman alpha absorption is in the ultraviolet normally, but if the cloud is at some redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer. So if the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen, the absorption line would be shifted. But for ground-based optical telescopes, they can't observe in the ultraviolet because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So the absorption line must be shifted into the visible spectrum for the telescope to detect it.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. To get that into the optical range, which is roughly 400-700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So we need the observed wavelength to be within that range.

The redshift formula is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1.

So, the minimum redshift would correspond to the minimum observed wavelength that is still in the optical. Wait, no. Wait, no, because higher redshift means the observed wavelength is longer. So wait, the Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is UV. To move it into the optical, which starts at about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), we need to calculate the redshift.

Wait, let me think: if the rest wavelength is
