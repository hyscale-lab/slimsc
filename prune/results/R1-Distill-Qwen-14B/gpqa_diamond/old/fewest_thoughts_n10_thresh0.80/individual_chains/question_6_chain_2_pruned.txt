Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I need to figure out the energy levels.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two dimensions, the approach often involves solving the Schrödinger equation. But wait, the potential here looks a bit complicated. Let's parse it. The potential has two terms: the first is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator term in radial direction. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. That seems angular-dependent, so it's probably related to an anisotropic oscillator or something with a deformation in the potential.

Wait, another thought: when you have a potential that depends on r² and cos²θ, maybe it's separable in some coordinate system. Oh right, in polar coordinates, the potential separates into radial and angular parts. Let me think about how to rewrite the potential.

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Factor out kr²: V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. That can be rewritten as (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Because 1/2 times 3 is 3/2. Wait, 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2. So V = (kr²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I should think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian in 2D polar coordinates is (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ). The kinetic part is already in terms of radial and angular momentum. So, the Hamiltonian will have terms involving L², which is the angular part, and the radial part.

Wait, but the potential here has a term with cos²θ, which suggests that the angular part might not be spherically symmetric. That
