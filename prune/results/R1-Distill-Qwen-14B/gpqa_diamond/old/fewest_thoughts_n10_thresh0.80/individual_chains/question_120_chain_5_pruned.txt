Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are inverse powers of plx. Let me try to think through this.

Alright, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax in astronomy is measured in parsecs, and the formula is distance (d) in parsecs = 1 / parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. The bigger the parallax, the closer the star is.

But wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Oh, uniform distribution in the sky. But wait, does that mean uniformly distributed in space, or just spread out on the celestial sphere? I think it probably means uniformly in space, so they're spread out without any particular clustering.

Wait, no, the problem states "uniformly distributed in the sky." Hmm, that might mean that their apparent positions on the celestial sphere are uniform. But distance also plays a role in how they appear. So how does that affect the number of stars per unit parallax?

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. So, for a given volume of space, the number of stars in that volume would determine how many we see at a certain parallax.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, like, if I consider a small range of parallax (say from plx to plx + dplx), how many stars are there in that range.

Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. But how does the volume relate to parallax?

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. So for a given range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding range in distance?

plxd is from d=1/plx to d=1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, but I think it's easier to think in terms of d. For a small change in plx, how does that translate to a change in distance?

Wait, maybe I should model this using calculus. Let's say the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so it's a constant n.

We can think of the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number
