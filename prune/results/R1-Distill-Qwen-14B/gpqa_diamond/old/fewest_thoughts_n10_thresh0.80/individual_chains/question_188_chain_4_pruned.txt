Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let me think.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance, which is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice, is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters. Oh right, there's this formula: d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )... wait, no, that can't be exactly right.

Wait, no, actually, for a cubic system it's simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal or a different system? Wait, rhombohedral is a special case of the hexagonal system where all three axes are equal length, and the angles between them are all the same. Or wait, no—rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, but with all edges equal and all angles equal but not 90 degrees. So it's a sort of distorted cube.

So the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of terms involving h, k, l, and the cosines of the angles between the axes. The formula is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +
