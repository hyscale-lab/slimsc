Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second—those numbers. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that.

So, the vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The squares are (-1)^2=1, 2^2=4, 1^2=1. Sum is 1+4+1=6. Oh, wait, that's 6. So the state isn't normalized. I think I remember that you have to divide each component by the square root of the sum to normalize it. So the actual state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down what P looks like. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix P is:

[ 0          1/sqrt(2)    0 ]
[ 1/sqrt(2)  0           1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0          1/sqrt(2)    0 ]

Wait, I think I should write it properly. So P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me note down the elements correctly.

I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the observable matrix P. The probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's inner product with the state vector.

So first, I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix P. But wait, maybe there's a shortcut because the matrix looks symmetric. Oh, right, because P is Hermitian (if it's an observable), which it should be. Because the elements are real and it's symmetric. Wait, looking at P: the first row is [0, a, 0], second [a, 0, a], third [0, a, 0], where a = 1/sqrt(2). So yes, it's symmetric, so it's Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real.

So the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's try to find them.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix (P - λ I):

Row 1: [-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ      a         0     |
| a      -λ        a     |
| 0       a       -λ     |, where a = 1/sqrt(2)

The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix can be expanded. Let me compute it.

Expanding along the first row.

-λ * det[ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a , a*a ] Wait, actually, expanding the determinant:

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a^2 ] 
- a * [ a*(-λ) - a * 0 ]
+ 0 * [ ... ]

So the determinant is:

-λ [ (λ^2) - a² ] - a [ -a λ ] + 0
