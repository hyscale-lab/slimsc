Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, let me think. So the setup is that Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible because having gas around can mess up the electron microscopy by causing scattering.

But even with all that pumping, some gas particles are still there, and the mass spec confirmed that. So Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment. So higher pressure means shorter mean free path because molecules collide more often.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes to λ2, which is not the same as λ1. But the temperature is the same, so that factor doesn't change. I'm trying to remember what affects the mean free path. Oh right, the formula is λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the mean collision diameter. Alternatively, another version relates it to pressure P and absolute temperature T through the equation λ = k*T/(√2 π d² n), but since n is proportional to pressure, higher P means lower λ.

Wait, but when Mike turns on the electron beam, what changes? The electrons are moving at high speeds, right? So maybe the gas molecules get ionized or something when the electrons hit them. I think that when electrons interact with gas molecules, they can cause them to become charged. Oh, because the electron beam has a high current density, it can cause gas molecules to ionize. That would change the nature of the gas in the chamber.

Ionized gas molecules have different properties. The mean free path depends on the number of collisions, which could be altered if the gas is ionized. Wait, but in terms of collisions, ionization might not directly affect the mean free path because the formula is based on neutral molecules. Unless the presence of ions affects the overall pressure or the way they collide.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may get excited or ionized, but does that change their number density? Well, maybe not the number density directly, but perhaps the effective cross-section for collisions changes. Hmm. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement of the electrons affects the gas. The electrons are moving very fast, so maybe they cause the gas molecules to move more or change their distribution. Or, the electron beam could cause the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait, wait, another thought: the mean free path is calculated assuming elastic collisions, but when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be ionized, which would result in inelastic collisions. But the mean free path formula might not account for that. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces other factors, like the gas becoming a plasma, which could alter the mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam interacts with the gas, causing it to expand or change pressure. But the question says the pressure didn't change because the temperature is the same. Wait, pressure is proportional to nRT. If T is the same, and R is a constant, then pressure would stay same if n is same. But if the gas is ionized, the number of neutral atoms might decrease, but the total pressure could stay the same because ionized particles contribute to pressure too. Or wait, actually, in a plasma, the pressure is due to all the charged particles. So maybe the number of neutral atoms decreases, but the pressure remains same because the ionized particles (ions and electrons) contribute as well. So the number density n for neutral molecules would be lower, which would increase the mean free path, because λ is inversely proportional to n.

Wait, so if n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. Because
