Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

So, the question is about some mixtures of liquids that undergo certain reactions. Let's start by listing the given information to make it clearer.

First, there's a mixture X which is equimolar (so equal moles) of two liquids. This mixture X can decolorize bromine water. I remember that bromine water is used to test for unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes because they can undergo addition reactions with bromine, causing the solution to decolorize.

Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, and this leads to a new mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, Y's components must not have any double or triple bonds because those are what cause the decolorization. Wait, but if Y can't decolorize bromine, perhaps the starting material's unsaturation was eliminated.

The next part says that when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation (with platinum under severe conditions), they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%, and it's part of mixture Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated—no more H2 can add.

So, what's the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z? 14.28% is about 1/7, right? Because 14.28% is roughly 1/7 (since 1/7 is about 14.29%). So, the molecular formula of Z must have hydrogen making up 1/7 of its mass.

Hydrocarbons are made of C and H. Let's find the molecular formula of Z. Let's denote it as CnHm.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Let me compute this:

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m

Subtract 0.1428m from both sides:

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572m = 1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n

Calculating 1.7136 / 0.8572: Let me approximate. 0.8572 is roughly 6/7 (since 6/7 ≈ 0.8571). So 1.7136 is approximately 1.7142, which is 12/7, because 12/7 is about 1.7143.

So,

m = (12/7) / (6/7) ) *n

Wait, wait. Let me compute 1.7136 / 0.8572.

1.7136 ÷ 0.8572 ≈ 2.

Wait, 0.8572 is 6/7 = ~0.8571, and 1.7136 is roughly 12/7 (12/7=1.7143). So 12/7 divided by 6/7 is 2. So m = 2n.

So, the formula is CnH2n.

Wait, but CnH2n... that's the general formula for alkenes. But wait, Z is a hydrocarbon and doesn't react with hydrogen, so it must be fully saturated. That would mean it's an alkane, which has the formula CnH2n+2. Wait, but earlier calculation suggests CnH2n. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's go back.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.2
