Okay, I'm trying to solve this NMR question. Let's see what the question says. So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing. A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so if it's di-substituted, that adds two more groups. So 6 + 2 = 8, so each substituent might have one carbon each. Or maybe one substituent is a single group with two carbons? Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group. Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group, so one of the substituents is a carbonyl. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond is present, so another substituent is a halogen, like Cl or Br.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, which means two substituents attached. The ring itself has 6 carbons, so the substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. Because total is 8 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon. Oh, but wait, substituents can be more than one carbon. Wait, let me think. If the ring is 6 carbons, and substituents add 2 more, then each substituent is a single carbon, or one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, that can't be. So substituents are two groups each with one carbon, maybe.

Wait, but substituents can
