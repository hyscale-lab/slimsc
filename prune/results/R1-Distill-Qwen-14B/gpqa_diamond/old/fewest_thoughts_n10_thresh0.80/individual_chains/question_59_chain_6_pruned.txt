Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies. The question involves mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. I need to figure out the pH after they're all mixed together. 

Wait, mixing acids and a base? Oh right, when you mix an acid and a base, they can neutralize each other. But wait, in this case, there are two acids and a base. So I think I should first calculate the moles of each acid and the base, then see how they react.

Let me write down the given data. The volumes and concentrations are:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

First, I'll calculate the moles of each. Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). 

For CH3COOH: 0.5 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 moles.
For HCl: 0.4 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 moles.
For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 moles. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So, let's break it down. The HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 will dissociate completely, giving OH- ions.

Now, when H+ and OH- ions react, they form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other first, I think. The excess will determine the pH.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid. It doesn't fully dissociate. So, when mixing, the strong acids and the strong base will react first, and then the weak acid might come into play depending on what's left.

Let me think. So, first, let's figure out the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Wait, no. The HCl is the main source of H+. So HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute much H+ initially. The Ba(OH)2 gives 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

So the H+ and OH- from HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react. So moles of H+ = 0.08, OH- = 0.18.

The neutralization reaction would be:

H+ + OH- → H2O

So, H+ is limiting. 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-. That leaves OH- remaining: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So after this neutralization, the OH- is in excess. Now, what about the acetic acid?

Wait, after the strong acid and base neutralize, the remaining solution has some OH- and also the acetic acid. So the OH- from Ba(OH)2 that's left will react with the acetic acid if possible. Because acetic acid is a weak acid, its conjugate base (acetate) could potentially react with the OH- ions. Wait, no. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. OH- is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, no. Let me think: OH- is a strong base and will react with the
