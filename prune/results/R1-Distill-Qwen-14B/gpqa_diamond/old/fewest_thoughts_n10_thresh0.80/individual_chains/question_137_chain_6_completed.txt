Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what I remember about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

Wait, a synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron used for accelerating particles to high energies. In a cyclotron, particles move in a magnetic field and get accelerated by an electric field. The key thing about synchrocyclotrons is that they have a varying magnetic field, unlike the regular cyclotron which uses a constant field. This allows them to accelerate particles to much higher energies, even beyond the speed of light in the lab frame, but wait, protons can't go beyond the speed of light, so maybe that's not the case here.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, T≈0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Hmm, two accelerations? Not sure what that part means yet.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0]. The data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

We need to find how many revolutions the proton makes. So, the number of times it goes around the circular path in the synchrocyclotron.

I remember that in cyclotrons, the time for each revolution (the cyclotron frequency) is related to the magnetic field and the particle's mass. But in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field isn't constant. Oh wait, the frequency of the applied voltage has to match the cyclotron frequency as the particle's velocity changes, so the field varies with time to keep the resonance condition.

Wait, but how does the number of revolutions relate to the energy gained? Let me think about the process. Each time the proton goes around, it gains some energy from the electric field. The total energy is the sum of all these gains.

Wait, but the proton starts with negligible kinetic energy. So the first acceleration would give it some energy, then as it gains speed, the magnetic field changes to keep the frequency in sync with the electric field's frequency. Or wait, in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field increases as the particle's momentum increases to keep the cyclotron frequency matching the frequency of the applied voltage.

Wait, the cyclotron frequency is f = (qB)/(2πm), where q is charge, m mass. But in synchrocyclotrons, B increases over time, so the frequency ν (which is the same as the applied voltage frequency) also increases. But since the proton's mass is much larger than its momentum, maybe the frequency of the magnetic field's change is different?

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the energy gained in a synchrocyclotron. The kinetic energy gained per revolution is related to the voltage applied. But wait, because the magnetic field is changing, the radius of the orbit increases, and the time for each revolution changes.

Alternatively, considering the average energy per revolution. Hmm.

Wait, I think each time the proton completes a half-revolution, it gains energy from the electric field. Because in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied across the gap, and the particles pass through it twice per cycle—once for each half of the orbit.

But in this case, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν t + Φ0]. The phase shift is π/4, so it's a cos function with a phase shift.

But the key is that each time the proton passes through the gap (twice per revolution, I think), it gets accelerated. So the energy added per revolution is roughly 2 times the voltage, but that's in a regular cyclotron. Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the applied voltage is varying with time, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found by considering the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution.

Wait, the total energy gained by the proton is 950 MeV. So if I can find the energy per revolution, I can divide 950 MeV by that to get the number of revolutions.

But how much energy is gained per revolution?

Wait, in a regular cyclotron, the maximum energy is given by E = q U N, where N is the number of times the particle is accelerated. Because each time it goes through the gap, it gains q U, and since it goes through twice per revolution, that would be 2 q U per revolution. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the acceleration process. In a cyclotron, the particle is accelerated each time it passes through the electric field region, which happens twice per orbit. So the energy per revolution is 2 * (q * U). But since the voltage is varying with time, perhaps each revolution doesn't contribute the same amount of energy. Or does it?

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field strength increases with time, allowing the frequency of the applied voltage to remain matched to the cyclotron frequency as the particle's momentum increases. So each time the particle goes around, the magnetic field changes, but the energy added per revolution is approximately constant? Or does it change?

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that U(t) is a function of time, but perhaps the maximum energy is achieved after many oscillations, and the average energy per revolution can be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is applied in such a way that each time the particle goes through the electric field, it gains U0 energy. Wait, the voltage is U0 cos(...), so the maximum voltage is U0. So the maximum energy gain each time would be e * U0, since the charge of a proton is e.

Wait, but wait, the energy gained is e * U. Because the potential difference is U. So if the voltage is U0 cos(...), the maximum energy added each time would be e * U0. But since the phase is π/4, the first time it goes through might not be at the maximum.

Wait, but the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the first acceleration would give it e U0 * cos(Φ0), which is cos(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707. So the first energy gain is e U0 * 0.707. But then, as the proton gains energy and the magnetic field increases, the time per revolution changes.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I remember that in synchrocyclotrons, the number of revolutions N can be approximated by the formula:

N ≈ (E)/(e U0) * (gamma / (2 pi)) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is approximately e U0 N, where N is the number of times the proton is accelerated. Since each acceleration gives e U0 (assuming maximum voltage), but wait, the phase is π/4, so the first acceleration isn't maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of full cycles (each cycle being half a revolution?) I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think about how the energy is gained. Each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains energy e U. The voltage is varying sinusoidally, so the particle gets energy each time the voltage is such that the electric field is in the correct phase.

But since the particle is moving in a circular orbit, every time it completes half an orbit, it passes through the acceleration gap. So two accelerations per revolution. So the number of accelerations would be 2N, where N is the number of revolutions.

Wait, but the initial kinetic energy is zero, negligible. So the first acceleration gives e U(t=0) = e U0 cos(Φ0) = e * 190,000 V * cos(π/4) = e * 190e3 * (√2/2) ≈ e * 134,800 V.

But as the proton gains energy, its velocity increases, so the time for each orbit changes. Wait, the cyclotron frequency is f = (q B)/(2 pi m), which is the frequency of the applied voltage. But in a synchrocyclotron, B is adjusted so that the frequency remains matched as the proton's momentum increases.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the energy gained per revolution is approximately e U0. Because per revolution, the particle goes through the gap twice, and each time it gains e U0 (if U is maximum). But wait, the voltage is U0 cos(2 pi nu t + phi), so the maximum energy added each time is e U0 when the cosine is 1.

But because the phase starts at pi/4, the first time it's at 1 might not be the first acceleration. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains an average energy of e U0. So the total number of accelerations would be E_total / (e U0).

But wait, the total energy is 950 MeV. Let's compute that.

The charge of the proton is e = 1.602e-19 C.

So E_total = 950 MeV = 950e6 * 1.602e-13 J = let's compute that.

Wait,

950 MeV = 950,000,000 eV = 950e6 eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E_total = 950e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 950e6 * 1.602e-19 = (950 * 1.602) * 1e-13 J.

Compute 950 * 1.602: 950 * 1.6 is 1520, 950 * 0.002 is 1.9, so about 1521.9. So E_total ≈ 1521.9e-13 J = 1.5219e-10 J.

The energy per acceleration is e * U0. U0 is 190,000 V.

So e * U0 = 1.602e-19 C * 190,000 V = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = (1.602 * 1.9) e-14 ≈ 3.0438e-14 J.

Each time the proton goes through the gap, it gets this energy. But each revolution brings it through the gap twice, right? So per revolution, it gains 2 * 3.0438e-14 J = 6.0876e-14 J.

So the number of revolutions N is E_total per revolution energy:

N = E_total / (energy per revolution) = (1.5219e-10 J) / (6.0876e-14 J) ≈ (1.5219 / 6.0876) * 1e4 ≈ 0.25 * 1e4 = 2500.

Wait, 1.5219 divided by 6.0876 is approximately 0.25.

So N≈ 0.25 * 1e4 = 2500.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500.

Hmm, but wait, that's assuming that the voltage is applied at maximum each time, which might not be the case because the initial phase is pi/4. So the first time around, the voltage isn't at maximum.

But wait, in the problem statement, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the first acceleration gives a small energy. But perhaps for high-energy particles, the number of revolutions is approximately E/(e U0) / 2.

Wait, let me think again. Each revolution gives two accelerations, each adding e U0 on average. So the total number of accelerations is 2N.

So the total energy is E = (number of accelerations) * (e U0) * cos(phi0?) 

Wait, but in the problem, U(t) is U0 cos(...), so the maximum energy per acceleration is e U0. But the first acceleration might not be at maximum because of the phase shift.

But if the number of revolutions is large, the initial phase might not contribute significantly to the total. So perhaps the average energy per acceleration is e U0.

Wait, but wait, the voltage is maximum at certain times. Since the proton is going around in a circle, each time it passes through the gap, the phase might change. But for a large number of revolutions, perhaps the average energy added per acceleration is e U0.

So, the total energy E = (number of accelerations) * (e U0).

Number of accelerations is 2N (since two per revolution), so:

E = 2N e U0.

Solving for N:

N = E / (2 e U0).

Wait, let's compute that.

E is 950 MeV = 950e6 eV.

e is 1.602e-19 C, but since we're working in eV, e U0 has units of eV.

Wait, U0 is 190,000 V. So e U0 = (1.602e-19 C) * (190e3 V) = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = 3.0438e-14 J. But in eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, then 3.0438e-14 J = (3.0438e-14) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 1.9e5 eV = 190,000 eV = 190 keV.

So e U0 = 190 keV.

So the energy per acceleration is 190 keV. Each revolution has two accelerations, so 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV per revolution.

Wait, no, each revolution has two accelerations, each of 190 keV. So per revolution, E_rev = 380 keV.

Wait, no, wait. The energy per acceleration is 190 keV? Because U0 is 190 kV. So each time the voltage is applied at maximum, the proton gains 190 keV.

Since each revolution has two such accelerations, the energy per revolution is 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV.

So the number of revolutions N is total energy divided by energy per revolution:

N = E_total / (380 keV) = 950e3 eV / 380e3 eV ≈ 950 / 380 ≈ 2.5.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.5 revolutions would be way too few for 950 MeV. Wait, wait a second, no, because the units are in MeV and keV. Oh wait, E_total is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV.

So N = 950,000 keV / (380 keV) = 950000 / 380 ≈ 2500.

So N≈2500 revolutions. Which is option D.

But wait, let me check the math again.

E_total = 950 MeV = 950,000 keV.

Energy per revolution = 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV.

Number of revolutions = 950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the answer should be D) 2500.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain and the energy per revolution. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and is accelerated by the alternating voltage \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \). The total kinetic energy gained by the proton is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Gain per Acceleration**:  
   Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains energy proportional to the applied voltage. The energy gained per acceleration is approximately \( e \cdot U_0 \), where \( e \) is the charge of the proton. Since \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \), the energy per acceleration is \( 190 \, \text{keV} \).

2. **Energy Gain per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton passes through the electric field twice per revolution (once during each half-revolution). Thus, the energy gained per revolution is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rev}} = 2 \cdot 190 \, \text{keV} = 380 \, \text{keV}.
   \]

3. **Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total energy gained is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \). The number of revolutions \( N \) is given by dividing the total energy by the energy gained per revolution:  
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{E_{\text{rev}}} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{380 \, \text{keV}} \approx 2500.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The proton makes approximately **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron. This matches option D.
