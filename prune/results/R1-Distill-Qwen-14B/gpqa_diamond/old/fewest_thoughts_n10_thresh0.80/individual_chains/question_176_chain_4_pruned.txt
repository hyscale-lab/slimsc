Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully. Let me read through the problem again.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the magnitude squared. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 1 + 4 +1 =6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. I guess I'll have to normalize it first because probabilities depend on that.

So the normalized state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So it becomes (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)). That's important because when I calculate probabilities, I'll need this normalized state.

Next, the problem is about measuring observables P and Q. The first measurement is P, then Q. But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring them in that order. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, measuring one observable affects the state for the next measurement because the state collapses into an eigenstate of the first observable. So I need to find the state after measuring P and then find the probability for Q in that state.

Wait, but wait a second. Observables P and Q: their matrix representations are given. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of each operator, probably. Let's tackle operator P first.

Operator P's matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

That
