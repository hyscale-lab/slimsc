Okay, so I have this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The 1H NMR has several signals, but none are vinyl hydrogens. Also, in the NMR, there's a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. The options are four different structures, which I should probably look at.

First, let me think about the IR part. A broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches due to hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group, which makes sense because carboxylic acids have a carbonyl. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group. That makes all the options possible because all of them end with COOH or CH2COOH.

Looking at the NMR now. The question mentions that none of the peaks are vinyl hydrogens, so there's no double bonds in the structure. So the molecule is probably saturated.

In the NMR, there are some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These are pretty complex multiplets, which suggests that the protons are coupling with several neighboring sets of protons. Each splitting would come from adjacent groups.

I should probably draw the structures of the options to see their NMR possibilities.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like CH2CH2 but with substituents. Wait, maybe it's a geminal di-substituted group. Let me think: the molecule is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central part has two CH groups each attached to C2H5 and another CH which is attached to CH2COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So it's CH2CH2... Wait, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each attached to C2H5 and with an ethyl group on the adjacent carbon.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So, two CH groups attached to methyl groups, and then a CH2COOH group.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, structure is CH2CH2... Wait, it's CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each attached to a methyl, with an ethyl group (CH2CH3) on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, trying to imagine the structures. Each of the options has a COOH group, which is why the IR shows the O-H and carbonyl.

The NMR doesn't have any vinyl hydrogens, so all the structures are aliphatic, no double bonds. So, that's okay.

Now, looking at the splitting in the NMR. The key is to figure out which structure would give rise to these complex multiplet patterns.

Each splitting (like a doublet, triplet, etc.) comes from neighboring protons. So, for a proton, each neighboring set of equivalent pro
