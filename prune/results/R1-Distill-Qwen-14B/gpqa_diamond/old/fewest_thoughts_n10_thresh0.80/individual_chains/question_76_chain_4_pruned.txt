Okay, so I've got this question about mouse embryonic chimeras and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Hmm, I need to figure out what the first thing they notice is when they do this experiment.

Let me break down the question. The setup is that they're using iPSCs from various tissues, each labeled with mRaspberry under a lineage-specific promoter. So mRaspberry is a red fluorescent protein, I think. They inject these dedifferentiated cells into a 32-cell stage blastocyst. Then they track them over 48 hours, and every 12 hours, they prepare embryos with TUNEL-FITC staining and look under a confocal microscope.

I remember that TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) is a method used to detect DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. It's a sign of apoptosis, right? So when a cell is undergoing apoptosis, the TUNEL assay will show a positive signal, which they've labeled with FITC here. FITC is a green fluorescent dye, so the apoptotic cells should show a green signal.

The question is about what the first thing noticed is when they look under the microscope. The options are A to D.

Option A: cell line-specific red signals label different organelles. I don't think so. mRaspberry is a nuclear marker, I believe, since lineage-specific promoters would drive expression in the nucleus. So if each cell type is labeled with a red signal, they would see red in the nucleus of the cells derived from each iPSC line. But the question is about the first thing noticed, perhaps when the embryo is developing.

Option B: green signal colocalizes with red signal. That would mean that the apoptotic cells (green) are the same cells as the red-labeled iPSCs. But iPSCs are pluripotent, so when injected into the blastocyst, they should integrate into the embryo and contribute to various tissues. But if the cells are undergoing apoptosis, maybe the red cells are dying and show green? But wait, the TUNEL is for the embryo's cells, not the injected iPSCs. Or is the TUNEL applied to the embryo to see where the iPSCs are and if they're apoptotic? Not sure yet.

Option C: no green signal. But TUNEL-FITC is applied, so I would expect some green if there's apoptosis. Unless apoptosis isn't occurring in the early embryo, which I don't think is the case. The early embryo might undergo some cell death.

Option D: cytoplasmic localization of red signal. If mRaspberry is a nuclear marker, then cytoplasmic localization would be unexpected. But if the cells are apoptotic, maybe the nuclear membrane breaks down during apoptosis, leading the red signal to be in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, if the promoter isn't active, the mRaspberry might not be expressed, but the question says they are labeled.

Wait, so the injected iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry under a lineage-specific promoter. So each iPSC line has a different promoter, so different cell types should show red in different lineages.

When they inject them into the blastocyst, the iPSCs should start migrating and differentiating into various tissues. But if they're tracking the fate of these cells, perhaps the first thing they look for is whether they are alive or dead.

If the red cells are undergoing apoptosis, then the TUNEL (green) would be in the same cells as red. So the green and red signals would colocalize. So option B says that the green signal colocalizes with red, meaning those cells are both expressing the red marker (from the iPSC lineage) and undergoing apoptosis (green from TUNEL).

But wait, when would the first observation happen? At the 12-hour mark. The blastocyst is at 32 cells, and after injection, perhaps the cells are just starting to migrate or maybe some are already undergoing apoptosis.

Alternatively, if the injected iPSCs are not yet differentiated, maybe they're not undergoing apoptosis yet, so the green signal is not present. But I remember that in early embryos, there's some apoptosis during development, like in the neural tube or other structures.

But looking at the options, which one would be the first thing noticed. If they're using TUNEL, which detects apoptosis, and the iPSCs are labeled red, then the first observation would be that some of the red-labeled cells are also showing green, meaning they're apoptotic.

So the first thing they notice would be option B: green signal colocalizes with red.


The experiment involves injecting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) labeled with mRaspberry (a red fluorescent protein) under lineage-specific promoters into a 32-cell stage mouse blastocyst. The goal is to track the fate of these iPSCs and observe their co-localization with apopt
