Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. Between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. So Planet3 is hotter than Planet2, which in turn is hotter than Planet1? Wait no, wait. Wait, the ratio is Planet1/Planet2 = 1.4. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2? Because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, right? Because if a planet is farther away, it's colder.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. The formula I remember is T = T_star * ( (L/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 / (a * (1 + m)) ) )^(1/2) ), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the simplified version when all else is equal, like circular orbits (so e=0), same star, etc., the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), where 'a' is the semi-major axis. Oh wait, but since the albedo is the same for all three planets (0.3), that part cancels out when taking the ratios. So the T ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio.

So, for Planet1 and Planet2: T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because T
