Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, in this case, the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Since elimination usually requires the leaving groups to be on adjacent carbons, I'm a bit confused here. Oh, wait, maybe it's a diepoxide? No, no, it's dibromide. Maybe the structure is such that when KOH is added, it leads to the formation of an alkene via a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 are on adjacent positions? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but since the two bromines are not adjacent, maybe it's a different process.

Wait, no, wait. I think I might have confused the positions. If it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in a bridge structure? Or maybe it's a norbornene-like system. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. But when you have two bromines and a strong base like KOH, substitution might lead to something else. Hmm.

Wait another thought: when 1,3-dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes they can form alkenes through a double elimination. Because each Br would leave, but the positions are such that elimination would form a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, in the structure of adamantane, perhaps the two Brs are on two bridgehead carbons that are not adjacent. Hmm. Maybe that's not possible for elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but with two bromines, maybe it's a double substitution. Wait, but KOH is a base, so perhaps it's elimination only.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR and IR data are given. So let's look at the spectral data. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the first product is likely a ketone or an ester. But considering the starting material is a dihalide, when you treat it with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation elimination to form a double bond, but wait, the IR here is for a carbonyl. So maybe elimination isn't the case here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could undergo two elimination steps, but that would form two double bonds, which might not fit the IR data. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where two OH groups are added, but that's more of a SN2 substitution. But with two Br atoms, that might give something else.

Wait, another angle: the product after KOH is treated with excess KOH, and the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but perhaps the product is an epoxide. No, wait, epoxide would require an oxygen in the ring, which would come from something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a Robinson annulation? No, that's for different reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Or maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? No, that would require more than two HX eliminations, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond. But the IR doesn't indicate a C=C stretch. So maybe the product is a ketone. How could that happen from a dihalide? Oh, wait! Maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, that's possible in some cases. For example, if the dihalide is in a position where elimination can form a ketone.

Wait, let me think: when a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent X groups) is treated with a strong base, you can get an elimination to form an alkene. But if the dihalide is part of a bridge structure, maybe the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, but that's usually not favorable due to the anti-periplanar requirement. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a substitution. But if it's KOH, perhaps an SN2 substitution occurs. But with two Br atoms, maybe something else happens.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a case of dehydrohalogenation where each Br is removed, and their adjacent Hs are abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But that would produce an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but how? Epoxides are formed from dihalides via an SN2 mechanism, but that typically requires treatment with a base but not KOH in such a way that would form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a peracid, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the IR peak is 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product after KOH is an ester or a ketone. Let me think about how that could form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Another possibility is that the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a diketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should move forward. The first product is 1, with NMR data. Let's see: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So the peaks are in the range of a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which suggests maybe an -OCH2O- structure, like an epoxide, but epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, maybe. Alternatively, it's an ether. Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent group.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. Let me think: the chemical shift around 4.79 for 2H could be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2-3 ppm, but maybe in a more deshielded environment, higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a carbonyl with adjacent CH2O groups.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH is a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is a double elimination of HBr, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution where two Br atoms are replaced by hydroxyl groups, but that would give a diol. But a diol's IR would show O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a ketone but an ester, but that would require some kind of esterification which I don't see happening here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with excess KOH. KOH is a strong base. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but as the two bromines are not adjacent, that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps each Br undergoes substitution, but that would give a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretch, so maybe the diol has been dehydrated. Wait, but then you'd get an alkene, which wouldn't explain the IR carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH, forming a diol. But then, perhaps upon heating, the diol undergoes some kind of elimination or rearrangement to form a carbonyl group. But if the product is formed directly, maybe the product is a diketone. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, and each Br is replaced by an OH group, but the OHs are in positions that allow for a subsequent elimination to form a carbonyl. But that seems a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination with the base abstracting Hs and the Brs leaving to form a double bond that could then undergo some oxidation. But oxidation would require another agent, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. Maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps it's an epoxide, but again, the shift doesn't fit perfectly.

Wait, another approach: the first product has a singlet (2H) at 4.79. What kinds of groups give singlets? Maybe an -OCH2O- group, as in an epoxide. But in epoxides, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent CH2, like in a ketone. For example, (CH2)CO would have the CH2 around 2.1 ppm or so, but maybe more deshielded if in a strained environment.

Wait, but 4.79 seems high for a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether group, like OCH2CH2O. But that would be a different scenario.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed to the second step, which is heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. I'm not entirely sure about this step, but aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is being alkylated or acylated here. But if product 1 is a ketone, Friedel-Crafts would require an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Friedel-Crafts isn't applicable here, so maybe another reaction. Or perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a base. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration step. Wait, if product 1 is a diol, then heating with a Lewis acid could lead to elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, a diol (vicinal diol) can lose water to form a ketone or aldehyde. That would fit with the IR data. So if product 1 is a diol, then product 2 would be a ketone.

Wait, that might make sense. So, product 1 is a diol (two OH groups on adjacent carbons). Then, when heated with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, the diol would lose two water molecules, forming a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group. Wait, but if it's a vicinal diol (like HO-R-CH2-CH2-OH), elimination would form an alkene. But if the diol is cyclic, like in a six-membered ring, elimination might form a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but regardless, product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Putting it all together, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from the new carbonyl groups and any remaining protons.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange with the solvent. So, I need to figure out the structure of product 3.

Let me recap:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH → product 1 (a carbonyl compound)
2. Product 1 treated with Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (probably an alkene or a ketone)
3. Product 2 treated with ozone → product 3 (resulting from ozonolysis)

Wait, maybe product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into carbonyl compounds. For example, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

But let's think again about product 1. The NMR data is:

- 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet? Or singlet?) Wait
