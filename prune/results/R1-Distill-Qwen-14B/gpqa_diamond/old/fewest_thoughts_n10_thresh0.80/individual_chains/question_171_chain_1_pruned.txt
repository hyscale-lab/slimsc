Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm. So, the question is about the yield of the para-isomer for six different substances when they react with excess bromine. I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, the problem says each undergoes an electrophilic substitution, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So for each, they form a single product, but I think the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction in the mixture when all these reactions happen. Or wait, no. Wait, let me read the question again. "Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer."

Oh, right, each substance will form a brominated product, and for each, how much of that product is para? So we need to find the para percentage for each, then arrange them from least to most.

Wait, but wait. Each reaction produces a monobromo derivative, and the question is about the para isomer. So each reaction may produce a mixture of ortho, meta, and para products, but the question states that only one monobromo is formed. Hmm, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," so maybe each reaction gives a single product. That would mean that the substituents are such that only one position is possible. Like, for example, if the substituent is strongly activating and meta-directing, but in such a way that only para is possible. Or maybe when there are multiple substituents, but the problem only has single substituents here.

Wait, no, looking at the substances:

1) C6H5-CH3: toluene. So the methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: benzoyl ethyl group? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, that's benzoyloxyethyl? Or is it phenoxyacetate? Wait, no, wait: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 is like benzoyloxy attached to an ethyl group. So the group is an ester, specifically a phenyl ester of ethanoic acid. Wait, wait no: the structure is benzene ring connected to a COOEt group (where Et is ethyl). So, the substituent is –COOEt, which is an ester group.

3) C6H5-Cl: chlorobenzene. Cl is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

4) C6H5-NO2: nitrobenzene. NO2 is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethylbenzene. An activating, ortho/para director.

6) C6H5-COOH: benzoic acid. COOH is a strongly deactivating group (due to the electron-withdrawing -COOH), and it's meta-directing.

Wait, but in this case, each of these substituents will
