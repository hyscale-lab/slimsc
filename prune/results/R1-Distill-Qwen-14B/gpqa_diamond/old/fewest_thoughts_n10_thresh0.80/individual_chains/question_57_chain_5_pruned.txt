Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons from a nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me phase shifts δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4 as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Oh wait, and the electrons are 50 MeV. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are in femtometers, so the answer is a length. 

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The general expression is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (something with the phase shifts). Oh right, more specifically, the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves involves the partial waves' contributions. 

The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ e^{2iδ_l} sin(2δ_l) / (1 - cosθ) ) ] for each l, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact form. Let me get it right.

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude — the question asks for that. So I'm focusing on the imaginary part, not the real part. 

The expression for f(θ) is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ ( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) / ( (k r
