Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because rearrangement reactions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A involves a reaction with BuLi and then H+, and part B is a Cope rearrangement under heat. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: The compound given is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw this structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an OCH2 group attached to the benzene. And the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Hmm, let me break that down. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait no, wait: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. Wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituent is attached at C1. So structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but actually, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the correct structure for but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C2 and C3, but starts at C1. Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but that's four carbons. Wait, wait. Butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. The but-2-en-1-yl group would be CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, that's three carbons? No, but-2-en-1-yl is four carbons with the substituent at C1. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- but wait, but that's four carbons, right? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. But
