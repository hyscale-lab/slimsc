Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question says that substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. Then I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, wait, the weight fraction of the para-isomer? Oh right, in electrophilic substitution, especially bromination, the product can have the substituent enter in different positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para to the existing group.

Wait, but each of these compounds has a substituent attached to a benzene ring. So when bromine reacts, the position where bromine adds depends on the directing effects of the substituent. If the substituent is activating, it directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions. If deactivating, it directs elsewhere.

But wait, each substituent has its own directing effects. Let's list out each substituent and see if they are meta directors or para/ortho directors, and whether they are activating or deactivating.

Substance 1: C6H5-CH3. That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director.

Substance 2: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. That's benzoyloxy ethyl? Wait, no. Wait, C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 is ethyl benzoate. The substituent is COOEt (ester group). Ester groups are deactivating because the oxygen can pull electrons via the inductive effect, but the lone pairs might donate some. Wait, no, esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So they are meta directors.

Substance 3: C6H5-Cl. That's chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a deactivating group because of its electronegativity, but it's an ortho/para director. Wait, chlorine is a bit tricky. It's deactivating (due to -I effect) but it's a weakly activating in resonance because it can donate electrons through resonance (if the substituent is attached to the ring, like in Cl). Wait, no. Wait, I think that chlorine is an ortho/para director because of the lone pairs, but it's a deactivating group. So the ring is less reactive, but the substitution is directed ortho and para.

Substance 4: C6H5-NO2. Nitro group. That's a strong deactivating group, meta director. Because nitro is a strong EWG, so it directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.

Substance 5: C6H5-C2H5. That's ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is activating, ortho/para director, similar to methyl.

Substance 6: C6H5-COOH. Benzoic acid. The COOH group is a strong deactivating group because of the -COOH being EWG. It's a meta director.

Wait, but wait, for substituent effects:

- Strong activating groups (like -O- , -NH2) are ortho/para directors.
- Moderate activating groups (like -R, alkyl groups) are ortho/para.
- Deactivating groups can be meta or ortho/para, depending on their structure. For example, Cl is ortho/para despite being deactivating, because of its lone pairs. Nitro is meta, as is COOH.

So for each substituent:

1. CH3: activating, ortho/para.
2. COOEt: deactivating, meta.
3. Cl: deactivating, ortho/para.
4. NO2: deactivating, meta.
5. C2H5: activating, ortho/para.
6. COOH: deactivating, meta.

Wait, but COOEt is an ester group. Esters are deactivating, meta directors. Right. So substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors because they are deactivating and meta-directing. Substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors, but 3 (Cl) is deactivating, while 1 and 5 are activating.

Now, when bromine adds via electrophilic substitution, the positions depend on the directing of the substituent. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, we need to determine the major product positions, and then see how much para product is formed relative to others.

But wait, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because in some cases, like when the substituent is meta-directing, the electrophile would add mostly in the meta position. But for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the incoming electrophile can add in both positions, but which is more favored?
