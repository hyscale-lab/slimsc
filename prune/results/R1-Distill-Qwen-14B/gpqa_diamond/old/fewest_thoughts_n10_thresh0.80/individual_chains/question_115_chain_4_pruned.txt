Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, they should annihilate completely and release energy. But wait, the problem says they produce two photons. Oh right, because they have to conserve momentum and energy.

So, the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measuredâ€”one upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

I need to find the angle between the two photons. To do that, I should probably consider conservation of momentum and energy. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their total momentum before annihilation must equal the total momentum of the photons after.

Wait, but electrons and positrons have the same mass (since a positron is the antimatter counterpart of an electron), right? So the masses are the same, but their directions are opposite. Let me think about their momenta.

The Lorentz factor is gamma, which is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. So gamma_e =4, gamma_p=2.

The relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, electrons and positrons have the same rest mass m. So for the electron moving to the right (since it's from the left), its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e. For the positron, which is moving to the left (from the right), so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p, but since it's moving opposite, the direction will matter. So the total initial momentum is p_e (to the right) minus p_p (to the left). Wait, no: if the positron is moving from the right, that's towards the left direction. So in terms of direction, let's say the electron is moving in the positive x-direction, and the positron in the negative x-direction.

So the initial momentum is the sum of their momenta. Let me calculate each momentum.

But wait, the velocity v relates to gamma. For each particle, gamma = 1 /
