Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity and nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. So, an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. So, first things first, let's get clear on the given information.

The initial nucleus has rest mass energy E = 300 GeV. Since E=mc², the rest mass M is 300 GeV/c². But maybe we don't need to compute that explicitly yet.

When it splits, the two fragments have rest masses adding up to 0.99 M. So, let me denote the masses. Let the smaller fragment have rest mass m, then the larger has 2m. So m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. And the larger fragment is 0.66 M?

Wait, no, wait. Because 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M. Then the larger fragment is 2m = 0.66 M. But wait, the sum is 0.33 M + 0.66 M = 0.99 M, which matches the condition. But wait, the initial nucleus has a rest mass of M, but the sum of the fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. So, that suggests that the rest mass energy of the nucleus is higher than the sum of the fragments, which is expected because some mass is converted into kinetic energy or other forms during the fission.

Wait, but wait, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, so the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, and the fragments sum to 297 GeV. So the total mass-energy after fission is 297 GeV plus the kinetic energy of the two fragments. But since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum must be zero, so the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their kinetic energies would be positive, adding to the total energy.

Wait, but energy and momentum conservation. Let me think about that.

So, the initial momentum is zero. After fission, the total momentum should still be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. But since momentum is mass times velocity, and the masses are different, their velocities
