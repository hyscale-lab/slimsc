Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, what's the Boltzmann distribution again? Oh right, it's the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state in a system at thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

So the formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). In this case, E_i is higher than E_j because the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the problem says that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited. So I think that means the population in the higher energy level is twice as much in star 1 compared to star 2.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So n_1 is twice n_2 for that state.
