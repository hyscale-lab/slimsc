Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

Alright, the question says that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And I need to find the uncertainty in Pz, ΔPz.

Wait, uncertainty principle, right. The formula is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). So I need to calculate the expectation value of Pz and the expectation value of Pz squared.

But first, I should probably figure out if the state is normalized. Let me check the sum of the squares of the components. The state is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the squares are (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1). Oh, it's normalized. Good, so I don't need to worry about that.

Now, the operator Pz is given. Looking at its matrix form, the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So Pz is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

So to find ⟨Pz⟩, I can compute the state vector multiplied by Pz and then take the inner product. Alternatively, since the state is a vector, I can compute each component multiplied by the diagonal elements.

The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So, ⟨Pz⟩ = ψ† Pz ψ.

Let me compute each term:

First component: (-1/2) * (ħ) = (-ħ/2)
Second component: (1/√2) * 0 = 0
Third component: (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (ħ/2)
Add them together: (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2) = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is 0.

Wait, that's interesting
