Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The experiment involves creating a bicistronic vector using lox-Cre technology to study their expression and interaction. The main issue is that when they look under the microscope, there's no green signal. I need to figure out why that might be happening.

Let me first parse the setup. The vector is bicistronic, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) under one promoter. The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. Both are under certain regulatory elements.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so it should drive expression of the ligand. The receptor is under an IRES element. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate ORF from the same transcript. So, the construct might produce a single mRNA that's translated into both ligand and receptor proteins.

But wait, there are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. I'm remembering that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The stop cassettes probably prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins unless Cre is present to excise them. So, in the absence of Cre, the stop codons would prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed. But when Cre is expressed, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

In this experiment, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre should be expressed in neural crest cells. The idea is that Cre would excise the stop cassettes in those cells, allowing the eGFP and mCherry to be expressed, marking the ligand and receptor.

But when they look under the confocal, there's no green signal. Hmm. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Let's think about why that might be.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct is for the same cell, right? Because the ligand and receptor are on the same vector. Wait, but if the ligand is secreted, it could act on neighboring cells. But in this case, the vector is designed to express both in the same cell. So I'm not sure if this affects the expression of eGFP. Maybe not directly. The issue is about whether eGFP is expressed, not about the interaction.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So if the receptor can't move from
