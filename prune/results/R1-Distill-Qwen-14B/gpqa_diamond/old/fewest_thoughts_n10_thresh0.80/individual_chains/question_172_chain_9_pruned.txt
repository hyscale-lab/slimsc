Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, okay, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but I'll think it through.

So the question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They're asking about the effective temperatures of the stars, T1 and T2, and which equation correctly relates them.

Wait, okay. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of energy levels in atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution gives the population of energy states. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy levels have a specific difference, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So for star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Let me clarify: when they say 'twice as excited', they probably mean that the population in the higher energy level (n_i) is twice that of star_2's for the same level.

Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio between two energy levels. Let me see. The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in that level compared to the lower level is higher.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, we can write the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) using the Boltzmann factor.

Let me denote the excited state as i and the lower state as j. So for each star, the ratio n_i/n_j would be exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Because ΔE is E_i - E_j, right?

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So for a specific energy level, the population in star_1 is higher by a factor of 2 compared to star_2. So
