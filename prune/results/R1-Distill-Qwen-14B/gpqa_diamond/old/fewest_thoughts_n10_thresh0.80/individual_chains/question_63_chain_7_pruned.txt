Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum stuff. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I have to calculate the correct one.

Wait, the fundamental stateâ€”oh right, that's the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state, both rotationally and vibrationally. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next possible state. But wait, the question specifies the "next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think that might mean the next vibrational state, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's the next rotational state?

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are quantized for both. Oh, but the fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or maybe J=1, depending on the model). No, wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational states are quantized, and the lowest rotational state is J=0, but I remember that the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state. So that's the state
