Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data provided is as follows: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Then, it's reacted with a set of reagents: first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I need to identify the final product from the options given.

Okay, let's break this down. First, I should probably figure out what the original compound is based on the NMR data. Once I have that structure, I can see how the reagents would react with it.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So:

(2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be 5 rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds. For example, one ring and two double bonds, or two rings and one double bond.

Looking at the NMR data, let's interpret each peak.

The first peak is at 9.72 ppm, a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm. So this is probably a carbonyl group, specifically an aldehyde.

Next, 6.98 ppm is a doublet (d) with 2H. Then 6.51 is another doublet (d) of 2H. These look like a pair of aromatic protons each, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-substituted ring, the protons are typically a doublet each, as each set is equivalent and coupled only to the adjacent protons. Wait, no, in para substitution, each proton is next to a substituent, but if it's a single substituent, like a methyl group or something else, but in this case, maybe it's adjacent to another substituent. Alternatively, the coupling could be between two sets of equivalent protons.

Then there's a peak at 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet (bs) with 2H. Hmm, broad singlet might be due to coupling with multiple protons or maybe being in a conjugated system. Also, 2H suggests perhaps a conjugated double bond, like in an enol or an enol ether, but more likely something else.

The last peak is at 3.66 ppm, a doublet integrating to 2H. This is in the range of CH2 groups, perhaps next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar. The doublet suggests coupling with another set of protons, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen or another group.

Putting this together: aldehyde proton, two doublets in the aromatic region (indicative of two para-substituted rings?), a broad singlet, and an OCH2 group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons. Let's see, the aldehyde is one C, then the aromatic rings would account for maybe 4 Cs (two benzene rings each with four carbons? No, wait, each benzene is 6 Cs, but perhaps substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a single benzene ring
