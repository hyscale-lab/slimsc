Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, the question is about a star that's the same size as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. Because only one hemisphere has these spots, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. But this setup is similar to what we'd observe if there were an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots?

Hmm, so I need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. 

Wait, but when a planet transits a star, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The area is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2, right? So the fractional change in brightness (Î”F) is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. 

But in this case, the star isn't a planet, but it's got these spots. So the brightness variation comes from the spots rotating in and out of view. Let me think about that. 

The star is observed to have periodic brightness variations because the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star's brightness decreases compared to when the other, hotter hemisphere is facing us. 

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, when they're on the side facing us, we see less bright light. So the star's apparent brightness would dip when the spotted area is towards us, and increase when the hotter area is visible. But wait, the star is rotating, so perhaps the spots are moving in and out of view as the star spins. So the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of the observer's view.

Wait, but the star's brightness without spots is what we'd compare to. So, the problem says that in the scenario where the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So the amplitude due to the spots is similar to the dip from a planet transit.

Wait a second, but the spot situation here is a bit more complicated. Because when the spots rotate, the brightness change is not just a dip but maybe a variation. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps they're considering the amplitude of the brightness variation to be similar to a transit. So we need to model the star's brightness when the spots are present and compare it to the dip when a planet transits.

But how does the spot coverage affect the star's total brightness? Oh right, the spots are cooler, so when they're on the star's surface, the star appears dimmer.
