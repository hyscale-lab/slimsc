Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I remember that scalar potential and vector potential are involved when dealing with moving charges. Let me think.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t. The charge q is moving with some velocity v at the time tr, which is earlier than t. So t is greater than tr, meaning we're looking at the retarded time or something like that.

From what I recall, when a charge is moving, the potentials depend on its position and velocity. The scalar potential V is usually similar to the static case but adjusted if there's motion involved. Oh wait, no, wait. The scalar potential for a moving charge might involve some terms like 1/(r - v t / c^2) or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) times some function of the position and maybe the velocity. The vector potential A would involve the velocity as well. 

In Maxwell's equations, the potentials appear in the Lorentz force, and they're related to the fields. I think the potentials for a moving charge can be found using the Liénard's potentials or something like that. 

Wait, the general expression for scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1/(r - (v/c²) t') where t' is the time when the charge was at that position. But since we're dealing with retarded time, maybe it's more involved.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by V = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/(r - (v/c²) t_r), where t_r is the retarded time. But wait, I'm getting confused between the field point r and the position of the charge.

Wait, the charge's position at time tr is s(tr), so the vector d is from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - s(tr). And since the charge is moving, its velocity is v at time tr. So the term involving the velocity would be about how much the charge has moved in the time since tr.

Wait, the expression for V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d - (v/c²) (t - tr)) ] but I'm not exactly sure. Or perhaps it's 1/(d c - d·v) over something. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the denominator in the potentials. For the scalar potential, the denominator might look like (dc - v·d), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - s(tr). So when you write the denominator, it's d c minus the dot product of d and v, all in some units. But I'm not positive.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)). Similarly, option D has d c plus d·v in the denominator. Hmm.

Wait, the denominator would have something to do with the motion of the charge affecting the potential. When the charge is moving, the potentials propagate at the speed of light, so terms like v·d would come into play.

Wait, I remember the denominator in the scalar potential for a moving charge is something like d c minus the dot product of d and v. Because the term (d c - v·d) would be something like the distance times c minus the component of velocity times d. So that would be c times (d - (v/c) * (d·v/(d^2)) * d) or something, but I'm not exactly certain.

Let me think about the Liénard's formula for scalar potential. The scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d - (v/c²) (t - t_r))]. But since d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, the term (t - t_r) is the time it takes for the influence to reach r. So d is related to the position difference, but the velocity term would be involved in the time.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the potentials for a charge in uniform motion. Oh wait, but in this case, it's any trajectory, so maybe we can't assume uniform motion.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials can be expressed in terms of the instantaneous charge position and velocity. So for the scalar potential, V is (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/(r - (v/c²) t), but I think that's not quite right. Because r is the position, but the charge's position is changing with time.

Alternatively, I'm recalling that the correct expressions involve the denominator (d c - v·d). Let's see: if d is r - s(tr), then the denominator would be d c minus (v·d). So option C and D have that.

So scalar potential V would be (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (d c - v·d)). Wait, why the c in the numerator? Because the units have to work out. Let's think about units. The denominator has [d] in meters, multiplied by c (m/s), so [d c] is m^2/s. The dot product v·d is [m/s * m] = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s.

The numerator is q c, where q is coulombs, c in m/s. So numerator is C·m/s. The denominator is m²/s. So overall, V has units (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C
