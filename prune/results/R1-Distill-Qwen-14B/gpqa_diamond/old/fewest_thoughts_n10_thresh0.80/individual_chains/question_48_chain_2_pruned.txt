Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. So, the first step is treating it with bromine. Wait, when a ketone is treated with bromine, I think it's a dibromination. Oh right! It's the haloform reaction, but wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait a minute—cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent like CCl4, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) get brominated. Cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons, each with two hydrogens. So, each alpha position can undergo bromination. But wait, the reaction conditions—maybe it's more like an addition. Alternatively, I think the actual reaction is that cyclohexanone undergoes alpha bromination. So, the product after step 1 (product 1) would be 2-bromocyclohexanone or 3-bromocyclohexanone? Wait, no, cyclohexanone is symmetric. So both alpha positions are equivalent. So, when bromine adds, it probably adds across the alpha positions, giving a dibromide.

Wait, no, wait. Another possibility is the formation of a bromohydrin. But no, Br2 in a non-polar solvent is more likely to induce a substitution or addition. Wait, wait, the reaction of ketones with bromine without any specific catalyst—oh, maybe it's the benzilic acid rearrangement? No, that's with ozone. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. The addition of bromine to a ketone could lead to the formation of a bromocyclohexanone. Oh wait, no. Maybe I'm mixing up reactions. Let me think again. Oh! The reaction of ketones with Br2 in a solution like aqueous or maybe it's an addition. Oh wait, wait, the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction is for alpha bromination of carboxylic acids, but I'm not sure about ketones. Alternatively, perhaps the addition is via enol formation. Or, wait, perhaps it's a bromination via the enol mechanism. So, cyclohexanone's enol would react with Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps
