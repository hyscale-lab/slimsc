Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has Earth's radius and is causing a transit. The second planet is bigger, and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have while still causing both transit and occultation events. Oh right, occultation is like when the planet passes behind the star from our point of view, right?

So, the given data: first planet's radius is 1 Earth radius. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane, so their orbits are aligned.

I remember that for a planet to transit, it has to pass in front of the star from our viewpoint. The transit's impact parameter is 0.2. Impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) between the center of the star and the planet's path, measured when the planet is closest. So impact parameter 'b' being 0.2 means the planet doesn't go right through the center, but it's within the star's disk, so a transit occurs.

Now, the key here is that both planets must pass in front and behind the star. So their orbital periods must be such that their orbital distances allow this. Wait, but how does the orbital period relate? Kepler's third law comes into play here.

Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, right? The formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. Or, when using units where P is in years, a in AU, it's P² = a³. But since the given periods are in days, I might need to use a different version.

Wait, but I think the problem is more about the relative sizes of the orbits. For both transits and occultations to happen, the second planet must be either inside the first planet's orbit or outside. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, no: if the second planet is too far out, then when the first planet transits, the second planet might not be in the right position to occult. Or maybe it's
