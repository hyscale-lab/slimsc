Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let's see. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, their mean decay distance depends on some factors like their lifetime and speed. But wait, how do I calculate that?

The problem gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are different distances, so I'm guessing I need to find the mean decay length somehow.

First, I think about what I know. The mean decay distance (L) should be the product of the particle's speed (v), its lifetime (τ), and the time it's observed. But since it's the mean distance, maybe it's just L = v * τ. But wait, how do I find τ?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. I remember from the uncertainty principle that Γ is the energy width, and it's related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ would be ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here. 

Let me jot down the equations step by step.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. Since Γ = ħ / τ, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the units for Γ are in MeV, and ħ is in J·s. I need to convert everything to consistent units. Maybe convert Γ to GeV or vice versa.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. But I'm not sure about the exact formula for the decay length. Let me think.

The decay length L is given by L = (γ v β) * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and β is v/c. Hmm, but I think another approach is to use the relativistic mean lifetime. The mean lifetime τ is γ multiplied by the proper lifetime τ0, where τ0 is the lifetime at rest. But wait, no, the formula I have is τ = γ τ0, where τ0 is the proper lifetime. But since Γ is the total decay width, and τ = ħ / Γ, regardless of the motion, right? Because Γ is the same in all frames because it's the inverse of the lifetime in the rest frame. Or wait, maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the velocity of the meson. The production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy E is related to the mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p, then find v.

Let me compute p. E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. But since E and m are given in GeV, I need to handle the units carefully. Let's see:

E = 8 GeV
m = 1.2 GeV/c² (since E = mc² → m = E/(c²), but I'm not sure. Wait, energy in eV and mass in eV/c². So m = 1.2 GeV/c², E =8 GeV.

So (pc)^2 = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV = 7.91 GeV.

So p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

But I need p to find v. The momentum p is also equal to γ m v. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to find β = v/c, since p = γ m β c.

So p c = γ m β (c^2) → but let me see:

p = γ m v = γ m β c. So,

p c = γ m β c².

So,

β = (p c) / (γ m c²).

Wait, but I can also find β using β = (pc)/E, because E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c → Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express β as (p c) / E.

Yes, because:

E = γ m c².

And p = γ m v = γ m β c.

So,

p c = γ m β c².

Dividing both sides by E = γ m c², we get:

(p c) / E = β.

So β = (p c) / E.

In our case, p c is 7.91 GeV (since p c = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV ≈ sqrt(64 - 1.44) ≈ 7.91 GeV).

So,

β = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ≈ 0.98875.

So v ≈ 0.98875 c.

That's pretty close to the speed of light. So v is approximately 0.9888 times c.

Now, back to the lifetime. The lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, which is τ0 = ħ / Γ. Wait no, Γ is the decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime. But in the rest frame, Γ is the inverse of the lifetime: Γ = ħ / τ0, so τ0 = ħ / Γ.

Wait, no. The decay width Γ is the total decay rate, which is related to the mean lifetime. The mean lifetime τ is the average proper lifetime, so Γ = ħ / τ0, where τ0 is the proper lifetime.

So τ0 = ħ / Γ.

But the particle is moving, so the observed lifetime is τ = γ τ0. But wait, no, because the particle is moving, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is γ τ0.

Wait, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ_lab, where τ_lab is the lifetime in the lab frame. So τ_lab = γ τ0.

But wait, because the decay width Γ is the same in all frames. Or is Γ different in different frames? Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime. The lifetime in the rest frame is τ0 = ħ / Γ.

But when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by γ: τ = γ τ0 = γ ħ / Γ.

So, the decay length is L = v * τ = v * (γ ħ / Γ).

Alternatively, since v = β c, and γ = E / (m c²), because E = γ m c².

So let's compute γ: E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c².

γ = E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) → because m c² is 1.2 GeV.

So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So, putting it all together:

L = v * τ = β c * (γ ħ / Γ )

But since β = (p c) / E = (7.91 GeV c) / (8 GeV) ) → as before, β = 0.98875.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to express everything in terms of known constants and the given variables.

Let me list the values:

E = 8 GeV

m = 1.2 GeV/c²

Γ = 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV)

c = 3e8 m/s

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s (I remember that ħ c is about 197 MeV fm, but for this, using ħ in GeV·s is better.)

So, first compute τ0 = ħ / Γ.

τ0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) ≈ (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.0568e-24 seconds.

Then, the lab frame lifetime τ = γ * τ0.

gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666666667.

So τ = 6.666666667 * 2.0568e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Then, the velocity v is β c. We found beta earlier to be approximately 0.98875. So v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute it more accurately.

So, v = β c = (7.91 GeV c) / (8 GeV) ) → Oh wait, no, beta is (p c) / E, which is (7.91 GeV c) / (8 GeV) ) → so the GeV cancels, and you're left with 7.91/8 = 0.98875 c.

So v =0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s ≈ 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, let me compute that:

2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.371 ≈ let's compute:

Approximately 3 * 1.371 is 4.113, but since 2.966 is slightly less than 3, maybe 4.065.

So 4.065 multiplied by 1e-15 → 4.065e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely. Gamma is E/(m c^2) → E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. So 8 / 1.2 is exactly 6.666666... or 20/3.

So gamma is exactly 20/3 ≈ 6.666666667.

Tau0 = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → let's compute that exactly.

6.582 / 0.32 = let's see. 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 20 + 0.182/0.32 ≈ 20 + 0.56875 → 20.56875.

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Then tau = gamma * tau0 → 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 s.

20/3 is approximately 6.666666667.

So 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 → let me calculate that.

Multiply 2.056875 * 6.666666667 = let's see:

2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.666666667 ≈ (2.056875 * 2/3) → approx 1.37125.

So total is 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 6.6666667 is 20/3, so 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875)/3 * 1e-24.

20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.

41.1375 / 3 ≈ 13.7125 → 13.7125e-24 s → 1.37125e-23 s.

Okay, that part is correct.

Then the velocity v is beta * c. Beta is (p c)/E.

p c is sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) → in GeV, since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², respectively.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So (p c) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV → sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875.

Thus, v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s → 0.98875 * 3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Now, L = v * tau → 2.96625e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.96625e8 * 1.37125e-23:

= (2.96625 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

Calculate 2.96625 * 1.37125:

Let me compute this:

2.96625 * 1.37125.

I can compute this approximately:

3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375.

But since 2.96625 is about 0.03375 less than 3, the product would be 4.11375 - (0.03375 * 1.37125).

0.03375 * 1.37125 = approx 0.0462.

So 4.11375 - 0.0462 ≈ 4.06755.

So approximately 4.06755e-15 m.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, let me do the exact multiplication.

Let me compute 2.96625 * 1.37125.

Breaking it down:

2.96625 = 2 + 0.96625.

1.37125 = 1 + 0.37125.

So:

(2)(1) = 2.

(2)(0.37125) = 0.7425.

(0.96625)(1) = 0.96625.

(0.96625)(0.37125) → let's compute this:

0.96625 * 0.37125.

Compute 0.96625 * 0.37125 = ?

Approximating:

0.96625 * 0.3 = 0.289875.

0.96625 * 0.07 = approx 0.0676375.

0.96625 * 0.00125 = approx 0.0012078125.

Adding these: 0.289875 + 0.0676375 = 0.3575125 + 0.0012078125 = 0.3587203125.

So multiplying the four parts:

2 + 0.7425 + 0.96625 + 0.3587203125 = let's add step by step.

2 + 0.7425 = 2.7425.

2.7425 + 0.96625 = 3.70875.

3.70875 + 0.3587203125 = 4.0674703125.

So the product is approximately 4.06747e-15 m.

Which matches option B's 4.0655e-15 very closely, considering possible rounding in the steps.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( \tau \) is the lifetime in the lab frame. The steps to calculate \( L \) are as follows:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to the momentum \( p \) and energy \( E \) by:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E}, \quad v = \beta c
\]

The momentum \( p \) is derived from the energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \implies (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)

\[
(p c)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \, \text{GeV}^2 \implies p c = \sqrt{62.56} \, \text{GeV} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875 \implies v = \beta c = 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \)

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0568 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

The lab-frame lifetime \( \tau \) is dilated by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), where:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

Thus:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.0568 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

---

### Final Answer
Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**

Answer: B
