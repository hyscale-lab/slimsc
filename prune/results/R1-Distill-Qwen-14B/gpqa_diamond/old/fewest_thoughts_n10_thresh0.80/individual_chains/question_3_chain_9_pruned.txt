Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the Pauli z-matrix. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x. And the options are given as A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Hmm, okay, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure over many measurements of the system in that state. The formula for expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state.

So the operator here is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I think I can break this down into two parts: the expectation of 10σ_z and the expectation of 5σ_x. Because expectation values are linear, right? So ⟨aO + bR⟩ = a⟨O⟩ + b⟨R⟩, where a and b are scalars and O and R are operators.

First, let's compute the expectation of σ_z, then multiply by 10. Then compute the expectation of σ_x, multiply by 5, and add them together.

But wait, since σ_z and σ_x don't commute, I can't just compute them separately and add... Or can I? Oh, wait, no, because expectation values are linear, it doesn't matter if they commute. So yeah, I can compute each expectation separately.

So, let's start with σ_z. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, this should be straightforward.

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's write this as a vector. Usually, in the σ_z basis, |↑⟩ is (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0, 1). So the state |ψ⟩ would be [0.5, (√3)/2]^T.

The operator σ_z is a 2x2 matrix. I remember σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So when you have an expectation value of σ_z, it's just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates.

Wait, the expectation value for σ_z is (amplitude of |↑⟩)^2 * 1 + (amplitude of |↓⟩)^2 * (-1).

So let's compute that. The amplitude of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so squared is 0.25. The amplitude of |↓⟩ is (√3)/2, so squared is (3/4). So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value of 10σ_z is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto σ_x. This is a bit trickier because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are not eigenstates of σ_x. So I can't directly use the same approach. Instead, I think I need to compute ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, I can remember that σ_x has eigenstates which are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But maybe it's easier to compute it directly.

The operator σ_x is the Pauli x-matrix: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to compute ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩, I can express |ψ⟩
