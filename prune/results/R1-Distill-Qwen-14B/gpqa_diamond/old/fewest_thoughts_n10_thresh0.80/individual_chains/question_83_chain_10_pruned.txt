Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should form the acetate ion and water.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Oh wait, and then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. I think I need to calculate the new concentration after dilution. 

To find the new concentration, I'll use the formula C1V1 = C2V2. C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40, which is 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

So, let me calculate moles of acetic acid. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 

Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react completely with the acetic acid. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing a mole of acetate. So at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions, which form a sodium acetate solution.

Wait, sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic. To find the pH, I need to find the concentration of acetate ions in solution.

The total volume at equivalence point is important. The initial solution is 40 cm³, and the volume of NaOH added depends on the moles. Moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. Molarity = moles / volume(L). So volume = moles / Molarity. Moles NaOH is 0.001, M is 0.1 M. So volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So total solution volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

The concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water. The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, Kb is that? Let me compute that again. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. Right.

Now, using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], and since Kb is very small, we can approximate that x is much smaller than 0.02, so [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 M. The pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ let's see, log(1e-5) is 5, so log(1.04e-5) is about 4.98 because log(1.04) is about 0.017. So pOH is 5 - 0.017 = 4.983. Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, log(1.04e
