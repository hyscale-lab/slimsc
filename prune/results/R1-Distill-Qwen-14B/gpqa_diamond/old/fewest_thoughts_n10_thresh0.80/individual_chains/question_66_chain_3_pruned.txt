Okay, so I have this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators that respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, let me think about each of these symmetries.

The question lists four symmetries and asks which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1,2; 3,4; 1,2,4; or 1,3,4.

First, let's break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity. All physical laws should look the same in any inertial frame. Operators in SMEFT must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So I think Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. Poincaré Symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincaré is a larger symmetry group. But wait, in SMEFT, are all operators required to respect Poincaré symmetry? Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Well, the Standard Model itself respects Poincaré symmetry, so all its operators (including the ones in SMEFT) should as well. So operators must respect Poincaré symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if a symmetry is part of a larger symmetry, does that mean the larger one is automatically required? Or is it the smaller one that's required?

Wait, no, because Poincaré includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is the other way: do operators in SMEFT respect Poincaré? I think yes because the SM does, so SMEFT maintains that.

So 1 and 2 must both be respected.

3. CP symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM has some CP symmetry, but not all operators do. For instance, the CKM matrix in QCD has CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning they don't have to respect it. Hence, CP symmetry isn't necessarily a must.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in special relativity
