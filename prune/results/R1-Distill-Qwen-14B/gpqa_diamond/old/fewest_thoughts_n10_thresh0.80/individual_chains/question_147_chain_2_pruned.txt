Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, no, the antiproton is involved. Wait, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, in particle physics, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they typically produce other particles. But here, the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles.

The given data is that mA c² is 300 MeV. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A. The options are A through D, with velocities given as fractions of the speed of light.

Wait, so I need to calculate the velocity of each A particle. But first, I should think about conservation laws here. Since it's an annihilation process, energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe we can approximate that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy, making it non-relativistic. Hmm, but the problem says it's "slowly moving", so maybe we can model it as a non-relativistic collision.

Wait, but protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about their rest masses. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So each has that rest mass energy.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that mA c² is 300 MeV. So each A particle has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c². So the initial system is a proton and antiproton, each with rest mass 938 MeV/c², but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate their total energy as their rest energies plus kinetic. But wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy, so maybe we can consider it as moving non-relativistically.

Wait, but in the annihilation process, the initial particles (proton and antiproton) will convert into other particles. But wait, in reality, when a proton and antiproton annihilate, they typically produce mesons, but in this case, it's 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So each A has a mass of 300 MeV.

So, I think I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum. Since
