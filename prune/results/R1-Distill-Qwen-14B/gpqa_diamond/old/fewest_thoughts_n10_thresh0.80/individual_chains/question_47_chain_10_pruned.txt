Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me jot down the details and think.

First, the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. Degree of unsaturation = (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So n=9, m=11, x=2 (two oxygen atoms), y=1 (one nitrogen). Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation, which could be three rings, three double bonds, or a mix. Probably, since it's a small molecule, likely some rings and double bonds. Common in aromatic compounds, so maybe an aromatic ring with substituents.

IR data: The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1 with medium to strong intensity. These are usually N-H or O-H stretches. But looking at the options, I don't see any hydroxyl groups (like -OH), so it's probably N-H. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound has a carbonyl group, maybe an amide or ester.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. The triplet suggests two neighboring protons, so maybe an ethyl group attached to an oxygen or another electronegative atom.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. This is tricky. Broad usually suggests exchange, like NH groups, or maybe some kind of coupling that's broad, like an NH in an amide or amines. Or maybe it's a CH2 next to an oxygen, but the broadness is confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to something else, but not split much. Wait, let's think about the options.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet integrating for 2H. Quadruplet (q) usually comes from a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group where the neighboring group has two protons. So for example, in an ester like ethyl something, the -OCH2CH3. Wait, but then the triplet at 1.2 would be the CH3 of the ethyl. So the 4.5 ppm q is likely the -OCH2- part of an ethyl ester.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets, each integrating for 2H. These are likely from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the coupling between the two protons on each adjacent carbon would lead to doublets. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) suggests substitution with an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl or nitro group. The 7.0 ppm would be the other set of protons, perhaps more shielded.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is probably para-substituted with an electron-withdrawing group. The ethyl group as an ester or ether.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide (PhCONH2) with an ethoxy group on the 3 position. So the substituents on the benzene are ethoxy and carbonyl amide. But wait, benzamide has the CONH2 group. The IR should have N-H stretching, which is in the data. The NMR would have the ethoxy group as the triplet and the CH2O as a quartet. Also, the aromatic protons would be split based on substitution. If the substituents are at 3 and another position, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for benzamide, the amide group's NH would show up in IR, which is present.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is O=C(N-Ph-OEt)NH2? Wait, no. Formamide is HCONR2. So this would be HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the substituents on the benzene are OEt and HCO-N-. The IR would have the carbonyl at around 1720, which matches. The N-H in amides would show up around 3300-3500, which is in the data. The ethoxy group would give triplet at 1.2 (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits the NMR. But wait, in this case, the substituents are para. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches. But where's the N-H? The IR has the N-H stretch, but in the NMR, the broad peak at 4.0 ppm is 2H. Hmm, maybe that's the NH? No, because NH would be a singlet and perhaps broad, but integrating for 1H. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's some other group.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph, but wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO-NH2 attached to the benzene. Wait, no. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So 4-aminophenyl propionate would be O=C(O-)CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph? No, I think more correctly, it's the propionyl group attached to the amino group on the benzene. So, perhaps O=C(O-)CH2CH2O-NH-Ph? Or maybe it's the amino group attached directly to the benzene, with a propionate as an ester or something else. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) could be the NH2 group, but in the IR, we have the N-H stretches, but that would be for an amine. Wait, the compound has an amine? Because the formula is C9H11NO2. So N is in the molecule. In 4-aminophenyl propionate, the N is in the amine group. So the NMR would show a broad peak for NH2, maybe as a broad singlet integrating 2H? Or perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up? Or maybe the amine is deprotonated, but that's not likely in DMSO-d6, which is a common solvent. Alternatively, perhaps the N is part of an amide or ester.

Wait, looking back, the NMR at 4.5 ppm is a quartet for 2H. That suggests a -OCH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. So maybe the compound has an ester group. So perhaps it's an ester where the oxygen is attached to an ethyl group and to a carbonyl.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be O=C(OEt)-Ph-NH2, but wait, that's not correct. Benzoate esters are O=C(OEt)Ph. If it's 4-aminobenzoate, the structure would be O=C(OEt)Ph where the amino group is on the para position. So the substituents on the benzene are OEt and NH2. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the molecular formula of each option.

Let me break down each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO, but with an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) substitution. So the formula would be C7H5O2N plus C2H5O from ethoxy. So C9H8O3N? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me count:

Benzamide (C7H7NO) plus an ethoxy group replacing a hydrogen. The benzamide is C7H5NO2? Wait, wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

The molecular formula for 3-ethoxybenzamide:

The benzamide is C7H7NO. Wait, no. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So that's C7H7NO2. Then substitution with ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would remove one H. So the formula becomes C7 (from benzamide) plus C2H5O. Wait, benzamide is C7H5NO2 (since C6H5 is C6H5, then CONH2 adds another CO and NH2: so C7H7NO2. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me calculate each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: benzene ring with CONH2 and OCH2CH3 groups at para positions? Wait, no, it's 3-ethoxy, so meta. So the substituents are at 1 and 3 positions? Wait, benzamide is at position 1, and ethoxy at 3.

Wait, molecular formula: benzene (C6) + CONH2
