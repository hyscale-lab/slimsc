Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So the setup is that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Also, the sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

The question is about finding the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, in MeV.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. That means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should cancel each other out.

Let me think about the masses. Let me denote the masses of the two fragments as m1 and m2. The problem says one is twice the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2 * m2. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 0.99 * M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum: 2m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M / 3. So m2 is about 0.33 M, and m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, because 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M. So each is about a third of the initial mass, but wait: 0.33 + 0.66 = 0.99, yes.

But wait, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. Oh, but the rest mass of the fragments is 99% of M. So the rest mass of the system after fission is 0.99 M, which is 0.99 * M. So the mass that's been converted into energy is 1
