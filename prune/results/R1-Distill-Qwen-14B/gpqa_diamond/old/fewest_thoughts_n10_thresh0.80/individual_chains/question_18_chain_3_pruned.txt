Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I don't know if that's relevant here because the question is about elemental abundances. Maybe mass is a distractor, or maybe it's relevant for something else. But I'll focus on the given data for now.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method used in spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → which I think I can rearrange to find log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 → wait, wait, no. Wait, 12 + log10(...) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → that's -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Let me compute that. 10^-4 is 0.0001, 10^-0.5 is about 0.316, so 0.0001 * 0.316 ≈ 3.16e-5. So nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 = 1e-5. So nMg is 1e-5 times nH.

The question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, which is Star_1's Si abundance divided by Star_2's Si abundance, I think. Or maybe the ratio is Star_2/Si_1? Wait, the ratio is [Si]_1 / [Si]_2? Or the other way around? The question says "the ratio of silicon atoms", so it's probably [Si]_1 / [Si]_2. Or maybe the ratio of Star_2's Si to Star_1's Si. Wait, the way the options are given, I might have to be precise.
