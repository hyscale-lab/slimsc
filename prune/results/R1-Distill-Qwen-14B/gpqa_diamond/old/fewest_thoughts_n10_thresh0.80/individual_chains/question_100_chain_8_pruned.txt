Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I’m still learning. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is propene, right? Because the molecular formula for propene is C3H6. Propene is an alkene, so it's probably going to undergo some addition reactions.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh wait, that's a classic bromination of alkenes. So when alkenes react with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, it's a diaddition, adding a bromine molecule across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add Br2 to become 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No wait, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. Wait, but propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, no. Wait, propene is actually CH2=CHCH3, correct. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving BrCH2CHBrCH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this must be an elimination reaction. Since B is a dibromide, when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Wait, but since it's a vicinal dihalide (two Br atoms on adjacent carbons), when you eliminate, you lose two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. So the product C would be an alkene again. Wait, but propene was the starting material, so I think this would give back propene. Wait, no, because propene is CH2=CHCH3. If B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then eliminating would give back the same alkene. So C would be CH2=CHCH3 again, which is propene.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Let me think. When a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should eliminate twice, producing an alkene. So the reaction is:

CH2BrCH2BrCH3 + 2 KOH (alcohol) → CH2=CHCH3 + 2 KBr + 2 H2O.

So yes, C is propene.

Then, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D. Red-hot iron usually denoted a dehydrogenation reaction. Wait, but propene
