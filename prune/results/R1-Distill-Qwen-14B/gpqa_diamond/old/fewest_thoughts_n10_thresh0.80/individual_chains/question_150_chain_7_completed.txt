Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's a bit tricky. The NMR data is given, so I should probably start by analyzing that to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

Looking at the 1H-NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: A triplet integrating to 1H. That's a pretty high ppm, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it can be an acidic proton like from a ketone or something else. Hmm.

- 6.98 ppm: A doublet integrating to 2H. That's in the aromatic region, so maybe part of a benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. If it's a substituted benzene, perhaps para substitution.

- 6.51 ppm: Another doublet, also 2H. This is also aromatic. If the two aromatic doublets are each 2H, maybe it's a para-substituted ring. For example, like two substituents opposite each other on a benzene ring.

- 6.27 ppm: A broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet could indicate exchange with something, like an -OH proton, but wait, this is 2H. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Hmm.

- 3.66 ppm: A doublet integrating to 2H. This is probably an OCH2 group, because the doublet suggests coupling with another proton. Maybe it's attached to an oxygen, like an ether or acetal group.

Wait, let me piece this together. The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm, so maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. Then, the aromatic protons: the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 could be from a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's say each is a pair of protons next to substituents. So maybe the benzene ring has two substituents, each with a para configuration.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If this is from a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe part of a conjugated system. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. The aldehyde is at one end. Then, perhaps a CH2 group attached to oxygen, as in an acetal or something else. But wait, the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H could be part of a CH2 group connected to another CH2 or O. Maybe it's a vinyl group or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde. Let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO.

So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Degree of unsaturation = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5.

So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, one ring (benzene, which is 3), a double bond, and maybe a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde or ketone). Or some other arrangement.

Looking back at the NMR. The triplet at 9.72 is 1H, which is probably the aldehyde proton. Then, the two aromatic doublets add up to four H, but wait, the total aromatic region is 2H + 2H. So that's 4H from benzene. But benzene has 6H normally, so maybe each substituent is another aromatic ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzalacetophenone or similar. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diphenyl compound. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If there are two benzene rings, that's 12 C (each benzene is 6 C), but wait, the formula only has 8 C. So that's not possible. So perhaps not two benzene rings. Wait, maybe a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a chain containing an aldehyde, an OCH2 group, and perhaps a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or aldehyde attached to a benzene ring via a chain. Let me try to visualize.

The 3.66 ppm doublet would be for two H; perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an O, like OCH2CH2... but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group between two carbonyls or something else.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange with OH, but wait, 2H? Maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an O, but in a more complex environment. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring but that doesn't make sense because the integration is 2H, not 4H.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the structure is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde is benzalacetophenone, but maybe that's too long.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like 4-(something)benzaldehyde.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and another substituent. Let me think about the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is probably the aldehyde H. Then, the aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene. For example, the benzene ring has a substituent in the para position. Wait, but the substituent could be another group.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be from a vinyl group. Like, perhaps a CH2=CH group, but that's a possibility. Alternatively, perhaps a di-substituted CH group.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 group connected to an O, like OCH2CH2... but where?

Another thought: perhaps the structure is a coumarin derivative, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone or aldehyde group and another group.

Wait, putting it all together: the aldehyde, the aromatic ring with two substituents, a CH2 group adjacent to O, and another CH2 group somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a chain containing a CH2O-group and a double bond.

Wait, let me think about the possible reagents and what each step does. The reaction goes through three steps:

1. NaNO2 and HCl: This is usually a nitrous acid condition. Common reactions are diazotization, especially for aromatic amines. So perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Nitrogen is present, but as what? If it's an amine, then perhaps it's an aromatic amine, such as aniline.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any NH protons. Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Could that be an NH group? But 2H seems a bit off for an amine, unless it's a secondary amine, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound has an amino group that's been converted into a diazonium salt, which then undergoes hydrolysis in step 2.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction steps:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This is used to form a diazonium salt from an aromatic amine. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group (like an aniline derivative).

2. H2O: Diazonium salts in aqueous conditions can undergo various reactions. For example, hydrolysis to form phenols (if it's a substitution reaction).

3. Aq. KOH and heat: This sounds like a typical condition for elimination reactions, perhaps forming a double bond via the E2 mechanism, or maybe a cyclization.

So, let's think about the structure. The starting compound has an aromatic amine, which is converted to a diazonium salt, then hydrolyzed. Let's see.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the starting compound has an aromatic amine, like an aniline (C6H5NH2), then the remaining part would be CH3O or something similar, but the formula is C8H9NO. Aniline is C7H7N; so the additional part would be CH2O, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde, but with some substituents. Wait, 4-aminobenzaldehyde is C7H7NO. The given formula is C8H9NO, so one more carbon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is 4-(something)aminobenzaldehyde. Let me think about the NMR.

The 9.72 ppm would be aldehyde. The 6.98 and 6.51 are for the aromatic protons. Then, the 6.27 could be from the amino group, but in the NMR, amines typically show up as broad signals. Wait, but the 6.27 is 2H, so maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzaldehyde, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: let me break down the NMR again.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is likely an aldehyde group. The aromatic region:

- 6.98 (d, 2H): perhaps the two protons on the benzene ring adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group or an aldehyde.

Wait, wait, if the benzene ring is para-substituted with an aldehyde group, then the adjacent protons (ortho) would be deshielded and appear around 7-8 ppm. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: the two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) suggest that the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. Each substituent would cause the adjacent H to be a doublet.

So perhaps the benzene ring is para-disubstituted. For example, one substituent is an aldehyde group, and the other substituent is another group, perhaps an electron-donating group.

Wait, but the other substituent can't be an aldehyde because that would require two aldehyde protons, but in the NMR, only one aldehyde proton is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an aldehyde and an oxygen-containing group, such as an ether or something else.

Wait, let me think about the 3.66 ppm doublet. If it's 2H as a doublet, perhaps it's a CH2O group, like OCH2CH2... something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzaldehyde. But the NMR doesn't show any OH protons, which usually appear around 1-5 ppm as broad peaks. Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's an -OCH2 group? But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a CH2OCH2 group, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an aldehyde and an OCH2CH2 group. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: benzene (6 C) + aldehyde (1 C) + OCH2CH2X. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes an oxygen and another benzene ring. Wait, but that would require more carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a phenyl group, but that would make the formula something like C9H8O, but with the given formula being C8H9NO, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an amino group, but that's where the reagents come into play. So the starting material has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction steps again. Step 1: diazotization with NaNO2 and HCl. That forms a diazonium salt. Step 2: H2O, which perhaps does a hydrolysis, converting the diazonium group into a hydroxyl group. Then, step 3: aqueous KOH and heat, which could be a base-catalyzed elimination, forming a double bond.

So perhaps the starting compound is an aromatic amine attached to a chain that includes a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Then, during the first step, the amine becomes a diazonium salt. In the second step, hydrolysis would replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl, giving 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, in the third step, with KOH and heat, maybe it undergoes some elimination.

Wait, but 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is C7H6O2. Our starting material is C8H9NO. So, maybe the starting material has more substituents.

Alternative approach: perhaps the starting compound is 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(aminophenyl)butanal or something similar. Let me think about the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 would be the aldehyde. The aromatic regions would be from the benzene ring. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets could be the ortho and para positions relative to the substituent. The 6.27 could be the NH2 group, but as a broad peak. However, the integration is 2H, which doesn't fit for an NH2 group.

Hmm, maybe the structure is something else. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

After the first step, the amine is converted to a diazonium salt. Then, in the second step, it's hydrolyzed. If it's a para-substituted benzene with an amino group and an aldehyde, the diazonium salt would form, and upon hydrolysis, the amino group becomes a hydroxyl group.

So the intermediate after step 2 would be 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, step 3 is KOH and heat, which could cause elimination. But 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde doesn't have any H adjacent to the hydroxyl group, so elimination isn't likely. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound has a chain that allows for elimination after hydrolysis. For example, if the starting material is 4-aminophenylpropionaldehyde. Then, after hydrolysis, it becomes 4-hydroxyphenylpropionaldehyde. Then, with base and heat, the propanal group could undergo elimination to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

Wait, let's think about that. The starting material would have a benzene ring with an amino group and a CH2CH2CHO group or similar.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR again.

The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be from a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Like a CH2CHO group. So, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde.

In that case, the NMR would show the aldehyde as a triplet (if coupled with a neighboring CH2 group), but in the given data, the aldehyde is a triplet. Wait, the aldehyde is 9.72 (t, 1H), which suggests coupling with two protons. So the aldehyde H is adjacent to a CH2 group. So the structure might be RCH2CHO, where R is connected to the benzene ring.

So, the benzene ring has an R group which is a CH2CHO attached, and perhaps an amino group.

Wait, but let me think about this. If the structure is 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde, the molecule would have a benzene ring with an aminoethyl group and an aldehyde group.

Wait, but the molecular formula would be C9H11N O (benzene is 6 C, ethyl is 2 C, aldehyde is 1 C, plus N and O). But the given formula is C8H9NO. So that's one less carbon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 4-(1-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde. But that would be similar in terms of formula.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The formula would be C8H9NO: benzene (6 C) + CH2CHO (2 C, but CH2CHO is 3 C, wait no, CH2CHO is 3 C (CH2-CHO is two carbons? No, wait, CH2CHO is CH2, then CHO, so that's two carbons: CH2-CHO would be two C, so 6 + 2 = 8. Yes, molecular formula fits.

So, the structure would be benzaldehyde attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a benzene ring that has an amino group in the para position.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the structure is 4-(aminophenyl)propanal? Not sure. Wait, let me structure this.

The benzene ring has an amino group (-NH2) in the para position. Then, attached to the benzene is a CH2CHO group. So the structure is:

Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO

Wait, but that would be 4-aminobenzylacetaldehyde. Let me count carbons: benzene (6 C) + CH2 (1 C) + CHO (1 C) = 8 C. Plus the amino group. So yes, molecular formula matches.

So, the NMR would show the aldehyde proton as a triplet because it's adjacent to the CH2 group. The CH2 group would be a quartet, but in the given data, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is adjacent to an oxygen, as in OCH2CHO. But then the formula would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with an OCH2CH2 group attached. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR again. The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests that the protons are adjacent to another group with protons. For example, a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like CH2CH2 but that's not possible. Alternatively, a CH2 group next to another proton, like in a CH2-CHO group.

Wait, if the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2OCH3 group, but the formula would have a methyl group, which isn't present here.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think about the reaction steps again.

The starting material has an aromatic amine, which is converted into a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis replaces the amine with a hydroxyl group. Then, in the presence of strong base and heat, an elimination reaction occurs, likely forming a double bond.

So, after step 3, the product would have a double bond somewhere.

Looking at the options, the products are aldehydes with various substituents and possibly double bonds.

Option A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-Ph-CHO, but wait, no, but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but the formula isn't matching. Alternatively, the structure would have two phenyl groups attached at positions 2 and 4 of a buten-al.

Option B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: So, two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4 of but-2-enal. Structure is CH2=CH-C(OH)Ph-Ph-CHO? Not sure, would need to count the carbons.

Option C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: Butanal is CH3CH2CH2CHO; this would have two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4 and a hydroxyl at position 3.

Option D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This would be Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.

Wait, let me think again.

After the reaction steps, the product is formed. So the starting compound has an aromatic amine, which is converted to a hydroxyl group upon hydrolysis. Then, under strong base, elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

So, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a substituent that allows for an elimination reaction.

Wait, let me imagine the starting structure as 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2O group attached. For example, 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2OCH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is 4-amino benzyl aldehyde. The structure would be Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. So, when treated with NaNO2 and HCl, the NH2 becomes a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis would replace it with OH, giving Ph-O-CH2-CHO. Then, in the presence of KOH and heat, the -CH2-CHO group would undergo elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but elimination would require adjacent Hs. The structure after hydrolysis would be Ph-O-CH2-CHO. The KOH and heat would dehydrate this, but where's the H? Maybe it would form Ph-O-CH2-CHO → Ph-O-CH=CH2?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the aldehyde is at the end. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after hydrolysis is Ph-O-CH2-CHO, and upon elimination, the CH2-CHO group might lose an H from the CH2 and the aldehyde group to form a double bond.

Wait, but that would require adjacent Hs. So, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CHO, and during elimination, the H from the CH2 and the aldehyde's H (which is a carbonyl group, not an H) would form a double bond. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility. After hydrolysis, the structure is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde attached to a CH2 group. So, Ph-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, the CH2-CHO group could undergo elimination, removing H2O and forming a double bond between the CH2 and CHO groups, resulting in Ph-OH-CH2-CHO → Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but elimination requires the departure of a leaving group, typically. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure after hydrolysis is Ph-O-CH2-CHO. Then, elimination would form Ph-O-CH2-CHO → Ph-O-CH2-CHO losing H2O to form Ph-O-CH=CHO. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure after hydrolysis is Ph-O-CH2-CHO. Then, KOH and heat could cause the CH2-CHO group to eliminate H2O and form a double bond between the CH2 and CHO groups. So, CH2-CHO → CH=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure becomes Ph-O-CH2-CHO → upon elimination, Ph-O-CH2-CHO → Ph-O-CH=CH2.

But wait, that would require the aldehyde group to lose an oxygen, which it can't do. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination occurs within the aldehyde group, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, the structure after hydrolysis has a secondary alcohol, which can then undergo elimination.

Wait, maybe the starting structure is (4-aminophenyl) propanal. So, after hydrolysis, it becomes (4-hydroxyphenyl)propanal. Then, under basic conditions, the propanal group could lose a water molecule to form a double bond. So, propanal (CH3CH2CHO) becomes CH2=CHCHO. Wait, but that would require the structure to be CH2CHOHCH2Ph, which upon elimination forms CH2=CHPhCHO.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So, the final product would be CH2=CH-Ph-CHO. But looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, structure would be CH2-CH2-Ph-CHO with a double bond.

Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with the double bond between C3 and C4. No, but-3-enal is actually CH2CHCH2CHO, with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but let me count the carbons in option D. 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal would be:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, it's:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → becomes Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → elimination would form Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the options and see which one makes sense.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the structure would be:

CH2=CHCH2-Ph-OH-CHO?

Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly. But-3-enal has four carbons in the aldehyde chain, with the double bond at position 3. So:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but that’s pentanal. No, but butanal is four carbons.

Wait, but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. So, the aldehyde is on the first carbon, followed by CH2, then a double bond to CH2.

Then, the 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl) substituent would be on the fourth carbon, which isn't possible because but-3-enal only has four carbons in the chain. Wait, let me number:

1: CHO

2: CH2

3: CH-

4: CH2-

Wait, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. So, the substituent would be on C4, but that's just the end, so it would be a phenyl group attached to the last CH2 group.

So, structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-Ph-OH-CHO? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the phenyl group is attached to the third carbon. So, but-3-enal would be CH2=CH-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO. But that doesn't make sense in terms of numbering.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

The starting material has an aromatic amine, which is converted to a diazonium salt, then hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group, and then undergoes elimination to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

So, the product after all steps would have a double bond conjugated to an aldehyde group.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. That has two phenyl groups at positions 2 and 4, and a double bond between 2 and 3.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, a phenyl group at position 4 and a double bond between 3 and 4.

Wait, but elimination typically forms a double bond closer to the leaving group. So, if the starting material has a substituent on the benzene ring and a CH2CHO group, elimination would form a double bond between the CH2 and CHO.

So, the product would have a double bond between CH2 and CHO, making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

So, the structure would be Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → upon elimination → Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO ?

Wait, but that's not possible because the aldehyde is at the end. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → upon elimination, lose H2O to form Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO, but that would require removing an H from the CH2 and the CHO group, which might not be feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination occurs within the CH2CHO group, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. After hydrolysis, it becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, the CH2-CHO group eliminates to form a double bond between the CH2 and CHO. So, the structure becomes Ph-O-CH2-CHO → Ph-O-CH=CHO.

But that would be an alkenyl group attached to the oxygen, which would form an enol ether perhaps. But that's not matching any of the options.

Hmm, maybe I should look for the options and see which one fits the description.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO

Wait, no, but but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO, with the double bond between C3 and C4, but that can't have a substituent on C4 because it's the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO → upon elimination becomes Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO.

But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, it's but-3-enal with a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on the fourth carbon. That would be:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH(Ph-OH)

But that's but-3-enal would have a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CHO, which is but-2-enal, not but-3-enal.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me clarify.

But-3-enal has four carbons in the aldehyde chain, with the double bond between C3 and C4. But wait, butanal is four carbons, so but-3-enal would be impossible because the maximum possible position is but-2-enal.

Wait, perhaps the correct name is but-2-enal. So, the correct structure for but-2-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO.

So, perhaps option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, but that would require five carbons, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe the options have a typo, but I should proceed with the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached to but-3-enal. So, the structure would be Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would be pent-3-enal, not but.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should proceed.

Given the reaction steps, the product should have a double bond and a hydroxyl group from the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt.

Looking at the options, option D has a but-3-enal structure with a 4-hydroxyphenyl group. So, perhaps that's the correct product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is option B, which has two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups and a double bond.

Wait, but the starting material has only one amino group, so after hydrolysis, only one phenol group would form. So, the product should have only one phenol group, not two. Therefore, options B and C which have two hydroxyphenyl groups might not be the correct answer.

Wait, the starting compound has one amino group, so after hydrolysis, only one hydroxyl group would form. So, the product should have only one phenol group.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal → two phenyl groups.

B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal → two phenol groups.

C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal → two phenol groups.

D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal → one phenol group.

So, only option D has one phenol group, which aligns with the starting material having one amino group.

Therefore, the product is option D.


The molecular formula of the compound is **C₈H₉NO**, and the NMR data provides the following key information:

- **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)**: Indicates an aldehyde proton.
- **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)**: Suggest a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Likely corresponds to a CH₂ group in a conjugated system.
- **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)**: Indicates a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen.

The reaction sequence involves:

1. **NaNO₂ + HCl**: Converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt.
2. **H₂O**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to form a phenol.
3. **Aq. KOH, Heat**: Facilitates elimination, likely forming a double bond.

From the NMR data, the starting compound likely contains a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and an aromatic amine. After diazotization and hydrolysis, the amine is replaced by a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol. The final step, involving elimination under basic conditions, introduces a double bond, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A (2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal)**: Contains two phenyl groups, which is inconsistent with the starting material having only one amino group.
- **Option B (2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal)**: Contains two hydroxyphenyl groups, which is inconsistent with the starting material having only one amino group.
- **Option C (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)**: Contains two hydroxyphenyl groups, which is inconsistent with the starting material having only one amino group.
- **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)**: Contains one hydroxyphenyl group and an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, consistent with the reaction sequence and the starting material.

### Conclusion:
The reaction sequence converts the starting material into a compound with a single hydroxyphenyl group and an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This matches **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)**.

**Answer: D**
