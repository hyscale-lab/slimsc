Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbitals. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, because p orbitals have l=1. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, but wait—that doesn't seem right. Oh, because when you couple two angular momenta, the maximum possible total l is l1 + l2. Since each l is 1, adding them gives 2. So the total l can be 2, 1, or 0. So in the given state, the total l is 2, which is possible.

But the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. I'm supposed to find the probability that both measurements give -ħ. Since each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is being measured.

Wait, but each electron's orbital angular momentum is described by L1z and L2z, right? So for each, the possible eigenvalues are mħ, where m can be -l, ..., +l. For l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So each Lz can be -ħ, 0, +ħ.

The state we're given is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm. Wait, but the state is given in terms of coupled angular momentum. So this is a state where the total orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and its z-component m is -1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how to express this state in terms of the individual electron states. Because the given state is a coupled state, but the measurements are on the individual Lz components.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total angular momentum is l=2, m=-1. But I think this is a combined state of the two electrons. So we can express this state in terms of the product states of the individual electrons. Because each electron has l=1, so their individual states are |1, m1> and |1, m2>.

The total state is a combination of |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = m_total. Since m_total here is -1, because the state is |..., -1>. So when you have two electrons each with l=1, the possible m1 and m2 are each -1, 0, +1.

Wait, no. The total state |l1, l2, L, M> is a combination of all possible |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = M. But in this case, M is -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific state in the L=2 multiplet, and is a linear combination of all |m1, m2> with m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the coupled states are expressed. The coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> can be written as a sum over m1 and m2, such that m1 + m2 = M, of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients multiplied by the product states |m1>|m2>.

So for L=2 and M=-1, the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. Let's list the possible (m1, m2) pairs:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

Similarly for m2. The sum m1 + m2 must be -1.

Possible pairs:

(-1,0): sum is -1.

(0, -1): sum is -1.

(1, -2): but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can't be less than -1. So the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, wait, m2 can be -1,0,1. So for m1 + m2 = -1, the possibilities are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1.

Is that all? Because m1 can't be 1 because m1 + m2 would be 1 + (-2) = -1, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can't be less than -1. So only those two possibilities.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> being (-1,0) and (0,-1). The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for these states would determine the expansion.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Do I have to calculate them? Alternatively, maybe I can think about the expansion by considering the symmetries or other properties.

Wait, but for the problem at hand, what matters is the possible |m1, m2> states that make up the given coupled state. Because when we measure L1z and L2z, the probability comes from the coefficients in the expansion of the given state.

So the given state is |1,1,2,-1> which is a superposition of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. So only the (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are present in this state.

So the possible (m1, m2) are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Because any others would sum to something else.

Now, the question is: what's the probability that when you measure L1z and L2z, both are -ħ?

So, for each electron, the measurement outcome is m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ. So the condition is m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But in our state, the only (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So in either of these cases, one of the electrons has m = -1, but the other has m =0 or m =-1. Wait, no.

Wait, in the (m1, m2) pair (-1, 0), m1 is -1, m2 is 0. So if you measure L1z and L2z, you get -ħ and 0ħ, respectively. So in this case, only one of them is -ħ.

Similarly, for (0, -1), m1=0, m2=-1. So L1z would be 0, L2z is -ħ.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So m1 =-1 and m2=-1. But in our coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, we don't have any terms where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because in that case, m1 + m2 would be (-1) + (-1) = -2, which is not equal to M = -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> does not contain any component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of getting both m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. The state is a combination of only (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So if the state is a linear combination of these two, then the probability for each is determined by the square of the coefficients.

But if the state is |1,1,2,-1>, then it's expressed as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) are only (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So the given state doesn't include any term where both are -1.

So the probability of both measurements being -ħ is zero. So the correct answer would be D) 0.

Wait, could there be any other terms? Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get l=2, M=-1.

The expansion of |1, 1, 2, -1> in terms of |m1, m2> is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (1)(2) ) / sqrt(6) ) [ |m1= -1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let's think about the states for two spin-1 particles (since l=1 is like a spin-1 system). The state |1,1,2,-1> is part of the l=2 multiplet. The general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is a bit involved, but perhaps for specific cases like M= -1, the coefficients are known.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible states. Since M=-1, the only possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state is a combination of those two. The coefficients would determine the probability.

But regardless of the coefficients, the only terms present are those where m1 and m2 sum to -1. So in no term do both m1 and m2 equal -1. Therefore, the probability of both being -1 is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l = 2 \) is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \). For each electron, the possible eigenvalues of \( L_{z} \) are \( -\hbar, 0, +\hbar \), corresponding to \( m_1, m_2 \in \{-1, 0, +1\} \). The condition \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) implies \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). However, the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a superposition of \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \) states where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \).

The possible \( (m_1, m_2) \) pairs that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) are:
- \( (-1, 0) \)
- \( (0, -1) \)

The state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include any term where both \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \), as this would require \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), which is inconsistent with \( m = -1 \). Therefore, the probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is zero.
