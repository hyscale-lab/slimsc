Okay, so I have this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a quasar was observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, with a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, I remember that quasars often have emission lines, and sometimes when you observe them, they can be redshifted. The peak at 790 nm—maybe that's an emission line that's been redshifted from its rest wavelength.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. Let me think about typical emission lines. Like, the Lyman-alpha line is around 121 nm in the UV. If that's redshifted to 790 nm, that would mean a significant redshift. Let me calculate the redshift. The formula for redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121 is roughly 6.52. So z would be about 5.52. That's a high redshift, meaning the quasar is very far away.

But wait, I'm not sure if the peak is Lyman-alpha. Another common line might be the Balmer series. Like H-alpha is about 656 nm in the optical. Wait, but 790 is longer than that, so maybe that's not it. Or perhaps it's from the infrared part of the spectrum. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from a different line, but the main point is that a peak at longer wavelengths suggests redshift.

Now, the question asks about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a way to measure distance in cosmology, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance D_C depends on the integral of 1/(H(a)) da, where a is the scale factor, and H(a) is the Hubble parameter as a function of scale factor.

But I don't remember the exact formula. Wait, the Hubble parameter H(a) is H0 multiplied by sqrt(Ω_r a^(-4) + Ω_m a^(-3) + Ω_k a^(-2) + Ω_Λ), assuming a flat universe which the question states. Here, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. The matter density Ω_m is 0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ is 0.7, and flat so Ω_k is 0.

So for a=1 (now), H(a=1) is H0, since the terms would be sqrt(Ω_m + Ω_Λ) = sqrt(1) =1, because Ω_r (radiation) is negligible now, I think. So H(a=1) is 70 km/s/Mpc.

Wait, but the question is about the comoving distance for the quasar at a=1, which would be D_C = integral from a=0 to a=1 of c/(a^2 H(a)) da? Or wait, the usual comoving distance for a source at redshift z is D_C = (c/H0) ∫_0^z [1/( (1+z') sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ )) ] dz'. Hmm, but I'm not sure I remember that correctly.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: for a given redshift z, the comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). So for z=5.5, but that's a high redshift, and the integral might be a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe we can approximate using certain methods. I remember that for high redshifts, when matter dominates, the integral simplifies. But with dark energy, which becomes dominant at later times, maybe the expansion is different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use an online calculator or a standard formula for comoving distance given certain parameters. But since this is a thought process, I'll have to approximate.

Let me think about the approximate comoving distances for certain redshifts.

At z=0.5, the comoving distance is around 1.5 Gpc (but not sure). Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc when H0 is 70. Because 1/H0 is about 14 billion years (but in Mpc units, 1/H0 is about 14,000 Mpc). Wait, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, so 1/H0 is 1/(70) Gyr? Wait, no, 1/(70) in units where H0 is 70 (km/s/Mpc). Let me compute 1/H0 in Mpc/(km/s). H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc → 1/H0 = 1 Mpc/(70 km/s) = (1 Mpc) * (1 s/(70 km)).

Wait, but to get the unit right for comoving distance, which is in Mpc. The integral ∫ (c / H(a)) da, where c is speed of light in Mpc/s. Let's compute the integral for a=0 to a=1, but for high z, that corresponds to a=1/(1+z). Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of lookback time and then get the distance from that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up a standard approximation for comoving distance for given Ω_m and Ω_Λ. I think there's an approximate formula when Ω_m + Ω_Λ =1, which they are here (0.3 +0.7=1).

Wait, for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance for a given z can be found using certain approximations or using a table.

Alternatively, I might recall that for z ≈ 1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc. But wait, z=5 is much higher. Let me think about some numbers.

Wait, I found before that for z=0.5, D_C is about 1.5 Gpc. For z=1, about 2 Gpc. For z=2, about 3.3 Gpc. For z=3, about 4.6 Gpc. For z=5, maybe around 6.5 Gpc? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Wait, the question gives options like 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So if z is about 5.5, which is z=5.5, then D_C might be around 7 Gpc? Or perhaps a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation formula for comoving distance. The formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / E(z')] dz'

Where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ )

Since Ω_Λ is 0.7, which is dominant, the expansion is actually accelerating. So for high z, the integral is a bit tricky.

But without doing the integral numerically, perhaps I can estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5 is approximately around 6 Gpc.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the Hubble distance, which is c/H0. H0 is 70, so c is about 3e5 km/s. So H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, so the Hubble distance is (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is about 4.28 Gpc. So the Hubble distance is about 4.28 Gpc.

The comoving distance for a redshift z is larger than the Hubble distance for z>0. So for z=1, D_C is about 2 Gpc, which is about half of the Hubble distance? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I think I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Hubble distance is c/H0. So H0=70, so 3e5 km/s / 70 km/s/Mpc = ~4285.7 Mpc, which is 4.285 Gpc. So that's about 4.3 Gpc.

But comoving distance for high z is larger than that. So for z=5, I'd expect D_C to be about 10 Gpc? Wait, no, that can't be right because the universe isn't that big in comoving terms. Or maybe it is.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc.

The redshift z was about 5.5. Let me see, if z=5, what's D_C?

I found an online source before that for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, D_C at z=5 is approximately 6.5 Gpc.

Wait, that would be close to option A (6 Gpc) and D (7 Gpc). Hmm. Or maybe the exact value is 7.1 Gpc? I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. The peak is at 790 nm. Suppose that's the Lyman-alpha line at 121 nm. So z = (790/121) -1 ≈6.52. Then, using a cosmology calculator, what's the comoving distance for z=6.52?

I don't have a calculator, but perhaps I can approximate.

Another approach: The luminosity distance is related to the comoving distance. But wait, the question is about comoving distance, so perhaps I can just think in terms of typical distances.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the relation between observed wavelength and redshift. The observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1+z). So for the peak, λ_emit is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), λ_obs is 790 nm. So (1+z)=790/121 ≈6.528. So z≈5.528.

Now, the comoving distance D_C for z=5.5. Let me think about how to compute it.

The comoving distance integral is from 0 to z of dz' / E(z'), multiplied by c/H0.

H0 is 70, c is 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 is (3e5)/(70) ≈4285.7 Mpc. So that's 4.285 Gpc.

So D_C = (c/H0) * ∫_0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) ] dz'

I need to estimate this integral numerically.

Let me try to approximate the integral ∫_0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) ] dz'.

I'll break it into segments.

From z'=0 to z'=1:

At z=0: denominator is sqrt(0.3 + 0.7)=1. So integrand is 1.

At z=1: 0.3*(2)^3= 2.4; 2.4 +0.7=3.1. sqrt(3.1)=1.76. So integrand is ~0.568.

So from 0 to 1, average maybe around (1 + 0.568)/2 * 1 = 0.784.

But that's a rough approximation.

Wait, more accurately, maybe I can use the midpoint method. Or perhaps Simpson's rule.

Alternatively, let's approximate each interval.

For z from 0 to 1:

At z=0: 1/sqrt(0.3 +0.7 )=1.

At z=0.5: 0.3*(1.5)^3 = 0.3*(3.375) =1.0125; 1.0125 +0.7=1.7125 → sqrt ≈1.308 → 1/1.308≈0.764.

At z=1: 0.3*(2)^3=2.4; 2.4+0.7=3.1 → sqrt≈1.76 → 1/1.76≈0.568.

So using Simpson's rule for [0,1], step 0.5:

∫ ≈ (Δz/3) [f(0) +4f(0.5) + f(1) ]

= (0.5/3) [1 + 4*(0.764) + 0.568 ]

= (0.5/3)(1 + 3.056 +0.568) = (0.5/3)(4.624) ≈ (0.5 *4.624)/3 ≈ 2.312/3≈0.7707.

So the integral from 0 to1 is approximately 0.7707.

Next, z=1 to z=2:

At z=1: 0.3*(2)^3=2.4 → E= sqrt(3.1)=1.76 → 0.568.

At z=1.5: 0.3*(2.5)^3=0.3*(15.625)=4.6875 →
