Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about particles in a detector. Alright, let's break it down.

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, what's the key here? It seems like it's related to how far the particles can travel before decaying. Oh right, because if they decay quickly, they might not make it to the detector's walls. So, the proper time each particle experiences before decaying must be connected to the distance they need to travel.

I remember that the proper time (tau) is the time measured in the particle's rest frame. The actual time experienced in the lab frame would be gamma multiplied by tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Because the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, we can approximate their speed as the speed of light, right? So, the distance they need to cover is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. 

So, if a particle is created at the center, it needs to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. The time it takes, from the lab frame, is distance divided by speed. Since speed is roughly c (the speed of light), that's 30 m / c. But wait, in the particle's frame, the time would be less due to time dilation. So, tau is the proper time, which is the time the particle exists before decaying. 

If the particle doesn't reach the wall, it decays before traveling 30 meters. So, the number that reach the wall depends on the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

Wait, but the problem mentions a Lorentz factor of ~20 in the first scenario, and only one third reach the wall. So, maybe the decay length is such that, at gamma=20, the decay length is such that only 1/3 make it. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds make it.

Hmm, so let's model this. The decay length L is given by L = gamma * c * tau. Because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma times longer than its proper time. So, the average distance it can travel before decaying is L = gamma * c * tau.

Wait, but the number of particles that reach the wall depends on whether L is greater than or equal to 30 meters. So, the probability that L is greater than 30 m is what we're looking for. 

In the first scenario, gamma is 20. When gamma=20, the fraction that reach the wall is 1/3. So, let's think about the probability distribution. Let me consider that the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle's lifetime is longer than a certain time t is given by exp(-t/tau), but I might be mixing up the variables here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the mean lifetime. The average lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So, the mean decay length is gamma * c * tau. 

So, the particles have a mean decay length of L_avg = gamma * c * tau. The detector's radius is R=30 meters. So, the number that reach the wall depends on how L compares to R.

Wait, but in reality, the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays before traveling a distance x is 1 - exp(-x/(gamma c tau)). So, the probability that it reaches the wall (x=R) would be P = exp(- R/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact formula right. The proper decay length is c * tau. In the lab frame, the length is gamma times longer, so L
