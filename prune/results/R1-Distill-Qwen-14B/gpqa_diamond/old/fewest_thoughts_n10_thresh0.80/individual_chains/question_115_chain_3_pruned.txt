Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

Okay, so there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between these two photons.

Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, their combined momentum and energy must be considered. Also, since the photons' energies are the same, that probably means their magnitudes are equal, but their directions are different.

Wait, Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need to calculate the actual velocities because the problem gives me the Lorentz factors. So each particle's energy and momentum can be determined using gamma.

The electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2. But wait, positrons are like electrons, same mass. So their rest mass is the same. Let me think about their energies and momenta before the collision.

The total energy of each particle is gamma * m c². Since the electron and positron have the same mass, the total energy of the electron is 4 m c², and the positron is 2 m c². Wait, but I need to think about their directions. The electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right), so their velocities are opposite. So their momenta would be in opposite directions.

So the momentum of the electron is gamma_e * m v_e, where v_e is its velocity. Similarly, the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m v_p. But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum would be negative if we take the electron's direction as positive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should write down the momenta and energies.

Electron (left to right): gamma_e =4, so energy E_e =4 m c². Its momentum p_e = gamma_e * m
