Okay, I'm trying to tackle this genetics problem. Let me read through it carefully and think step by step.

So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. We have three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants and double mutants. The results of their resistance to the pathogen are given.

The results are as follows:
- g1: 75% resistance (so 75% of the control's 100%, meaning it's less resistant than wild-type)
- g2: 0% (super susceptible)
- g3: 50% (so half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. The key point is that one of them is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Also, the question is about their interaction.

I need to figure out which genes are involved in which pathways and how they interact.

Let me think about what each of these results mean. 

First, looking at the single knockouts:
- g2 is completely susceptible (0%). That's a big hit. So the gene G2 is probably critical for resistance. Maybe it's the transcription factor because if you lose it, everything breaks down. So G2 might be a transcription factor regulating others.

g1 has 75% resistance. So it's somewhat less resistant. So G1 must be contributing to resistance but maybe not as crucial as G2. Similarly, g3 is 50%, so it's even less.

Now, looking at the double mutants. Let's see:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the plant is super susceptible. Wait, but why? If G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it's upstream of G1. Because if G2 is knocked out, then G1 might not be expressed either. But in the single mutant g1, it's 75% resistance, so G1 alone isn't enough, but when you also knock out G2, it's worse. Hmm, that doesn't fit directly. Wait, perhaps G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

Wait another angle: If G2 is a transcription factor, it could be activating G1 and G3. So in the wild-type, G2 is active, and both G1 and G3 are expressed. When you knock out G2 (g2), neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to very low resistance. But in g1, G2 is still present, so G3 is active, but not enough. Similarly, in g3, G1 is active but not enough.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g2: 0%. So both G1 and G2 are knocked out. But G2 is a transcription factor, so knocking it out would mean that other downstream genes (like G1 and G3) wouldn't be expressed. Wait, but in g1, G2 is still present, so perhaps G2 is not upstream of G1? Or maybe G1 is downstream of G2.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out (g2), neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, but perhaps not enough to provide full resistance. Hmm, but in g3, G3 is not expressed, so G1 is active, but that only gives 50% resistance.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the single, but if they are additive, the double would be worse. Wait no—actually, if they are in the same pathway, double mutant resistance might be similar to the more severe single mutant. If they are in separate pathways, their combined loss could be worse.

Wait, so in g2, 0% because G2 is the transcription factor for both. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in g1, G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. But in g1, the resistance is 75%—so higher than g3's 50%. So maybe G3 alone can't get as high resistance as G1 and G3 together.

Wait, but G1 and G3's single knockouts are 75% and 50%. So if G1 is better, then in g1, you have G3 expressed. So maybe G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 are additive. So if they're in separate pathways, their combined knockout would have a more severe phenotype.

But then, how does G2 fit in? G2 is a transcription factor for both, so without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in g2, both are inactive: 0% resistance.

But what about the double mutants involving G2? 

g1g2: 0% resistance. Well, since G2 is a TF, knocking it out would mean G1 and G3 aren't expressed, regardless of G1's status. So in g1g2, both G1 and G2 are knocked out. But since G2 is upstream, knocking it out would also mean G3 isn't expressed. So in g1g2, G3 is not expressed either. So the plant can't produce G1 or G3 because G2 is knocked out. So the resistance is 0%, which matches the data.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%: because G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So no resistance.

Now, looking at what each option says.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but the question says at least one is a TF acting upstream. The data suggests that G2 is the TF because without G2, resistance is 0. So if G2 is the TF, then A is incorrect because it says G1 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (pleiotropy), and G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, same promoter would mean G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But if both are knocked out, their double mutant is 10% which is worse than either single, which suggests they are in separate pathways. If same promoter, maybe knocking both out would not make it worse than the worst single. So perhaps B is not correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 have multiple effects, but I'm not sure. For epistasis, the idea is that one gene's effect masks the other. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1's pathway is downstream of G3. Because in epistasis, the downstream gene is epistatic. So if the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both singles—so perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

So in the presence of G1, G3 might not contribute much, but when both are gone, the effect is additive.

Wait, but in the wild-type, both are present. So if they're in parallel, their combined activity would lead to more resistance.

Wait, but the data shows that in the single G1 mutant, resistance is 75%, and in G3 it's 50%. So without G1, you have 75% (so maybe only G3 is active?), but without G3, you have 50% (so maybe only G1 is active). But when both are absent, you get 10%, which suggests that perhaps even with both G1 and G3, they only provide up to 100% (control at 100%). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 have similar functions. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either single. But looking at the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So this fits with redundancy because without both, you lose their additive effect. So the resistance drops to 10%, which is worse than either single.

And G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that G1 is downstream of G3. Because if G1 is epistatic, its pathway is downstream.

Wait, the data for the double mutant g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either single, so they are probably contributing additively, perhaps through separate pathways. So redundancy suggests that they can compensate for each other, but if both are gone, the effect is the sum of both.

Wait, but redundancy would mean that having either G1 or G3 is sufficient. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can take over, and vice versa. But in our case, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, so G3 is not enough. So that doesn't fit redundancy. Because if G3 was redundant, then g1 would have the same as g3, which it doesn't.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. Redundant genes would have overlapping functions. So if you knock out G1, G3 can compensate, leading to the same phenotype as wild-type. But in our data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which are worse than wild-type. So perhaps they are not redundant but additive.

So maybe Option D is incorrect in that regard.

Let me think about each option again.

Option C: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Epistatic means that G1 is downstream. So if G1 is epistatic, then knocking it out would prevent the effect of G3. But in the data, when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is worse than either. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is epistatic in the sense that its function masks G3's, but I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, let's model the interactions. Let's suppose that G2 is the TF activating both G1 and G3.

In g2: both are off → 0%

In g1: G2 is active, so G3 is on. So the resistance is 75% (g1: 75%). So without G1, but with G3, resistance is 75%. Hmm, but in g3, resistance is 50%. So without G3, but with G1, resistance is 50%? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I have this backwards.

Wait, if G2 is the TF, and it activates G1 and G3, then in g1, G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. So the plant has G3's product but not G1's.

So, in g1, the resistance is 75%. That's better than g3's 50%. So perhaps G3 alone (when G1 is knocked out) gives 75% resistance, but when G3 is knocked out, G1 gives 50% resistance.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. How can G3 alone give better resistance than G1 alone? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the TF for G1, and G1 is the TF for G3. So G2 → G1 → G3.

In that case, in g2, both G1 and G3 are inactive → 0% resistance.

In g1, G3 is not expressed (because G1 is needed to activate G3). So g1 would have no G1, so G3 is not expressed. But data says g1 is 75% resistance. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3 in parallel. So without G2, neither are expressed. So g2 is 0%, which fits.

In g1, G3 is expressed because G2 is active. So the plant has G3 product but not G1. If G3 alone provides 75% resistance, but in the data g1 is 75%, while g3 is 50%.

Wait, that suggests that G3 alone provides 75% and G1 alone provides 50%? That's inconsistent. Because when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which would suggest that G1 alone gives 50% resistance.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the epistasis. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 are additive. Which suggests they function in parallel pathways.

So, G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2 (g2), neither is expressed → 0% resistance.

In g1, G3 is still active (because it's under G2's control). So in g1, G3 is functional, providing 75% resistance. But wait, in g3, G1 is active (since G2 is present), so G1 provides 50% resistance.

Wait, but that doesn't fit the data because in g1, the resistance is 75% (so more than in g3). So G3 alone gives more resistance than G1 alone. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So without G2, both G1 and G3 are off. Without G1, G3 isn't expressed either. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which suggests that G1 isn't necessary for G3 expression, but perhaps G3 is expressed via another pathway.

Wait, but why would g1 have 75%? Maybe G1 is not the only way to get resistance. Perhaps the plant has another pathway, but perhaps G2 is needed for that other pathway as well.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for G1, and G1 is a TF for G3. So without G2, G1 isn't expressed, so G3 isn't either. So g2 is 0% resistance.

In g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. So g1's resistance is based on G3's activity. So maybe G3 provides 75% resistance. But in g3, G1 is present and active (since G2 is present), but without G3, resistance is 50%. So perhaps G1 alone provides 50% and G3 alone provides 75%.

Wait, but then if both are present, their combined effect would be 100%, which is the wild-type. That makes sense.

So in wild-type, both G1 and G3 are active, providing 100% resistance.

In g1, only G3 is active → 75%.

In g3, only G1 is active → 50%.

In g1g3, neither is active → 0%, but wait the data says 10%. That doesn't fit. So something's wrong with this model.

Wait, no. In the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single. So that suggests that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, and their combined loss is worse than either alone. So perhaps they're in separate pathways. So in the absence of G2, both are off. But when only one is off, the other is on.

So when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 is on, giving 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out (g3), G1 is on, giving 50% resistance. When both are knocked out, neither is on, so resistance is 10%. Hmm, but why 10%? Maybe there's another pathway, but not as effective.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and it activates G1. G1 activates G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are active. In g1, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed, giving 75% resistance.

But then in g3, G1 is active? No, because G1 is only expressed if G2 is active. Wait, but if G1 is a TF for G3, then in g3, G3 is knocked out. So G1 is active (since G2 is active), but without G3, resistance is 50%.

Wait, but in this model, G3's product is needed for full resistance, so losing G3 would reduce resistance. But why would G1 alone give 50%?

Maybe because G1 has another function beyond activating G3. So perhaps G1 contributes directly to resistance, and also activates G3, which contributes more.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both involved in different aspects of the resistance pathway, and they work together.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is a transcription factor for another gene, while G3 is a downstream gene of G2.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's try looking back at the options.

Option D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So in the double mutant, the effect would be similar to the more severe single mutant. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, so that doesn't fit redundancy.

So maybe option D is incorrect.

Option C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means that G1 and G3 have multiple effects, but I'm not sure how that applies here. For epistasis, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1 is downstream. So knocking out G1 would prevent G3's effect. But in the data, when both are knocked out, resistance is worse than either, suggesting additive effects, not epistatic.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe G3's function is upstream of G1. So if G3 is knocked out, G1's function can't be activated. But in the data, g3 has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1's 75%. That would fit if G3 is upstream of G1. So G3 being knocked out would prevent G1 from working, but in the data, g1 has 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think.

If G3 is upstream of G1, then without G3 (g3), G1 can't function. So the resistance would be lower than when G1 is knocked out. But in the data, g3's resistance is 50%, which is lower than g1's 75%. So that fits. So if G3 is upstream of G1, then knocking out G3 would prevent G1's function, so g3 would have lower resistance than g1. Which matches the data. So G3 is upstream of G1.

But wait, the initial data says that at least one gene is a TF acting upstream of others. So G2 is the TF. So G2 activates both G1 and G3. Or maybe G2 activates G3, which then activates G1.

Wait, but in the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% → suggesting they are both needed.

g2g3: 0% → because G2 is TF, so without it, G3 isn't expressed.

g1g2: 0% → same as above.

So perhaps G2 is the TF for G3, which is the TF for G1. So G2→G3→G1.

So in g3, G1 is not expressed. But in the data, g3's resistance is 50%, which is better than g2's 0%. Hmm, but that would mean G1 is downstream, but without G3, G1 isn't expressed. Wait, but in g3, G2 is active, so if G3 is knocked out, then G1 isn't expressed. So the resistance would be similar to g2's 0%, but the data says g3's resistance is 50%. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's think about epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the pathway of gene B is upstream of gene A.

In the double mutant, the phenotype is determined by the epistatic gene. So for example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would resemble gene A's mutant.

Looking at the data:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Which suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1, meaning G2 is downstream.

Because when G2 is knocked out, the phenotype is more severe than when G1 is knocked out.

Similarly, in g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either g1 or g3. So that doesn't directly point to epistasis but rather additive effects.

Wait, but let me think about the double mutant g1g3: 10% which is worse than either single. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, the resistance is even lower. So their effects are additive, not epistatic.

So, this suggests that G1 and G3 function in separate pathways, and when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

So, back to the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But our data suggests G2 is the TF. So A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulation), G3 is epistatic to G1.

Hmm, if they have the same promoter, knocking out both would not change the expression beyond knocking one out. But the data shows that g1g3 is worse than either single, so they aren't same promoter. So B is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is about multiple effects, but I'm not sure. But in terms of epistasis, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of the double mutant would resemble G1's single mutant. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that their functions are overlapping. So knocking out both would not make the phenotype worse than the more severe single. But our data shows that g1g3 is worse, so they're not redundant. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but the options don't seem to fit. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the double mutants in terms of epistasis.

Double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. Both have lower than the wild-type. So their combined effect is worse than either. So their effects are additive, not epistatic.

So, going back to the options, which option says that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are additive (not redundant, not epistatic)?

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that. Hmm.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

What does pleiotropy mean? It means that a single gene affects multiple traits. But in our case, G1 and G3 may each affect multiple things, but not necessarily pleiotropy in the same gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'pleiotropy' here refers to the genes affecting the same trait in different ways.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the genes being in the same pathway. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'pleiotropy' isn't the right fit, and the correct term is 'redundant' or 'additive'.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the data again. 

We know that G2 is the transcription factor because without it, resistance is 0%. The single mutants g1:75%, g3:50%, and the double g1g3:10%. So G1 and G3 are contributing additively.

So G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, working in parallel pathways.

So which option reflects this?

Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But redundancy would mean that their effects are overlapping, so double mutant would not be worse than the more severe single. But our data shows double mutant is worse. So D is incorrect.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is worse than either, so they are additive, not epistatic. So C is incorrect.

Hmm, none of the options seem perfect. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the initial question states that at least one is a TF acting upstream of others. So perhaps G2 is the TF, and it's activating both G1 and G3, which are in parallel pathways.

So the only correct option would be one where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are separate (additive) but not redundant.

Looking at the options:

Option D says G1 and G3 show redundancy. That's probably wrong.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but in series, but that would not explain the additive effect.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each providing partial resistance.

That would fit the data: g1 (only G3) → 75%, g3 (only G1) →50%, double mutant (none) →10% (assuming some other minor pathway).

So which option says that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the pathway would have G3 upstream of G1. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be determined by G1. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel, each contributing additively.

But none of the options directly state additive, but perhaps 'pleiotropy' is not the right term.

Looking at the options, the only one that has G2 as the TF is options A, B, C, and D.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be like G1's single mutant.

But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that the double mutant is similar to the more severe single. But in the data, it's worse. So D is incorrect.

Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But earlier I thought G2 is the TF, not G1. Because without G2, resistance is 0%.

So option A says G1 is the TF, which would be incorrect based on the data.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, option D says G1 and G3 show redundancy. So, without both, the effect is worse than either, which contradicts redundancy. So D is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine the epistatic relationships.

Let's think about the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

So in the double mutant g1g2, the phenotype is same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1, because the double mutant's phenotype is the same as the more severe (g2) single mutant.

Similarly, in g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is downstream.

Which gene is epistatic? The gene that is epistatic is the one whose function is downstream. For example, if G2 is downstream, then it's epistatic to G1 and G3.

So the epistatic gene is G2.

So one of the options should have G2 as the epistatic gene towards others.

Looking at options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → correct, as the data shows.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1 → would imply that in g1g3, the phenotype is same as g3. But in data, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So B is incorrect.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → in g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1. But data shows worse, so C is incorrect.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → same as C, incorrect.

So only option A and B have G2 as an epistatic gene.

But option A says G1 is the TF, which is incorrect because G2 is the TF.

So among the options, none seem correct. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the epistatic gene is the one that determines the phenotype in the double mutant. So when G2 is knocked out, the double mutant's phenotype is same as G2's, which suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So the correct statement would be that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which option states that?

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Yes, option A includes that.

But option A also says G1 is the TF, which we think is incorrect because G2 is the TF.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about G2 being the TF. Let me double-check.

The data says that in g2, the resistance is 0%. If G2 is a TF, then G2's product is necessary for the function of other genes. So without G2, those downstream genes are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

So the presence of G2 is required for resistance. So G2 is likely the TF.

But option A says G1 is the TF. So option A is incorrect.

Wait, but the question states that at least one gene is a TF. So G2 is the TF, which fits the data.

So the correct option must have G2 as the TF and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Only option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. But option A says G1 is the TF. So that's incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding 'epistatic towards' in the options.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So in the double mutant g1g2, the phenotype is same as g2. So the conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to G1, which is correct.

But option A says G1 is the TF, which is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's impossible because the question must have an answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming G2 is the TF. Let me consider another possibility.

Suppose G2 is not the TF, but G1 is. Then in g1, the resistance is 75%, which is less than control. So G1 is a TF for some other genes, perhaps G3.

But if G1 is the TF, then in g1, G3 isn't expressed. So the resistance in g1 would be due to other factors. But in the data, g1 is 75%, which suggests that some other genes are providing resistance.

But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which would imply that without G1, G3 is expressed but provides only 10% resistance. That doesn't fit well.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both TFs, each activating other genes.

But the question states that at least one is a TF upstream of others. So perhaps G1 is the TF that activates G3. Then, in g1, G3 isn't expressed. So the resistance in g1 would be due to other factors.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think differently.

The options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as the more severe single. But the data shows that g1g3 is worse than either, so redundancy is incorrect.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

In the double mutant, the phenotype is worse, so epistasis is unlikely. So C is incorrect.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, in option D, G1 and G3 show redundancy. So if they are redundant, then the double mutant's phenotype should be same as the more severe single. But data shows worse, so D is incorrect.

I'm stuck. Based on the data, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive. So their interaction is such that they are in separate pathways. 

Looking at the options, the only one that has G2 as TF is options B, C, D.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would resemble G1's single mutant. But the data shows 10%, which is worse than G1's 75%, so that's not the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would resemble G3's single mutant (50%). But data shows 10%, which is worse, so that's not the case.

So none of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps the best fit is option C.

Wait, option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that applies here. But the key is that G2 is the TF, which fits the data.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1's mutant. But the data shows worse, so perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'pleiotropy' is used incorrectly in the options, and what they mean is that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions, but not necessarily the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, with G1 acting after G3. So G3 is epistatic to G1. So if G3 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of G1's status. But in the data, g1 has 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck here. Given the options and the data, perhaps the best choice is option C.

Wait, let me recap:

- G2 is the TF.

- G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (additive).

- In the options, which one reflects that.

The options don't directly state 'additive'. So looking for the closest fit.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the double mutant would have the same as G1's single mutant, but the data shows worse. So perhaps that's incorrect.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant. That doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single, so their effects are additive. So each contributes part of the resistance.

Which implies that they are in separate pathways. So the model is:

G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways leading to resistance.

So G2 is the TF.

G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

So the correct option would have G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 as additive.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state additive, but perhaps 'pleiotropy' or 'redundancy' is the intended term.

Alternatively, 'gene redundancy' refers to genes that can compensate for each other, so the double mutant's phenotype is not worse than the single. But our data shows worse, so that's incorrect.

Hmm. I'm probably overcomplicating. Based on the data, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think about the epistatic relationships again.

In the double mutants:

g1g2 has 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3 has 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

g1g3 has 10% → worse than either. So their effects are additive.

So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So the correct option must have G2 as the TF and G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → correct part.

But option A says G1 is the TF, which is incorrect.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1 → incorrect.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → incorrect.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → incorrect.

So none of the options have G2 as the epistatic gene towards G3 and G1.

Hmm, but perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the TF part being incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier and G1 is the TF.

But given the data, G2 is the TF, so options that say G2 is TF are B, C, D.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy. But that's incorrect.

Option B says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. So if G2 is the TF, both would be off in g2. But their double mutant would be same as g2. But data for g1g3 is 10%, so same promoter isn't correct.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Based on the information, the correct answer must be option C, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D.

Wait, the question is about which conclusion can be drawn. Another approach: look for what each option suggests.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as G1's single mutant (75%), but data shows 10%, so that can't be right.

Wait, no. If G1 is epistatic, then the double mutant would have the same as G1's mutant. But data shows it's worse. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that the double mutant's phenotype is same as the more severe single. But data says 10%, which is worse, so D is incorrect.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another angle: the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, so G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. But that's not possible because if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant would not be worse than the single.

Wait, no. If they are in parallel pathways, the double mutant is worse than either single. So that supports the idea that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

So, which option supports that? None do, but perhaps option C, if 'pleiotropy' is interpreted as each affecting multiple pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps 'show pleiotropy' means that each gene affects more than one thing, but I'm not sure.

In the end, I think the correct answer is option C.


The question involves determining the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine that contribute to resistance against anthracnose. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to deduce the gene interactions and their roles based on this data.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (less than wild-type but not completely susceptible).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderately susceptible).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

3. **Key Inferences**:
   - **G2 is the transcription factor (TF)**: The complete susceptibility of g2 (0% resistance) suggests that G2 is critical for activating downstream genes involved in resistance. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function.
   - **G1 and G3 are additive**: The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%), indicating that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance in parallel pathways.
   - **Epistasis**: The double mutant g1g2 (0%) has the same phenotype as g2, indicating that G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, g2g3 (0%) has the same phenotype as g2, showing that G2 is epistatic to G3.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is the TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is incorrect because the data clearly shows that G2 is the TF, not G1.
- **Option B**: States that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (pleiotropy), and G3 is epistatic towards G1. This is incorrect because the data shows that G1 and G3 are additive, not co-regulated by the same promoter. Additionally, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.
- **Option C**: States that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This is partially correct in that G2 is the TF, but the claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is unclear. The data supports that G1 and G3 are additive, not pleiotropic. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic towards G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.
- **Option D**: States that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This is incorrect because redundancy implies that the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant. However, the data shows that g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, ruling out redundancy.

### Conclusion:
The data supports that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance in parallel pathways. While none of the options perfectly fit the data, **Option C** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the TF and partially aligns with the idea that G1 and G3 have overlapping roles (interpreted as pleiotropy). However, the claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is inconsistent with the data.
