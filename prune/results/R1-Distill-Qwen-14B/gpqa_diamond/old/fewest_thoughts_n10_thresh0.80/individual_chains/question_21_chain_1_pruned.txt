Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers and tautomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There's constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different connectivity, while stereoisomers are about spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts: part A and part B. Part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which compound among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, let me think about each part step by step.

Starting with part A. Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in bonding, leading to a different structure. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group can tautomerize to an enol form. So, I need to check if the given compounds can undergo such tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can have two forms, para and ortho. But wait, quinones in general can have keto-enol tautomerism? Or maybe not. Because quinones are fully conjugated systems. If I have two carbonyl groups, maybe they can't tautomerize because the structure is already conjugated, so the hydrogen isn't available for tautomerism. Or perhaps they can. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the structure is too stable, but I'm not sure.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. If the ring is symmetric, maybe each of the three ketones is part of a conjugated system. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, right? So in trione, each ketone is at alternate positions. So, each carbonyl is adjacent to other carbonyls. Wait, but each ketone is on a carbon that's adjacent to other ketones. So maybe the hydrogen isn't available because the carbons next to the carbonyl are already double-bonded, so there's no H to tautomerize. Or maybe the structure is such that the carbonyls are in positions that prevent enol formation.

Wait, let's think about each. Benzoquinone has two ketones. Do they have alpha hydrogens? Benzoquinone, like para-benzoquinone, has two carbonyl groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. Each carbon is part of the ring. The carbons adjacent to each carbonyl are the ones attached to the ring. So
