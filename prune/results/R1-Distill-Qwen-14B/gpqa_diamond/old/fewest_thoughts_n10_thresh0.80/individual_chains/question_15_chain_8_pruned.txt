Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being observed. Both are detected via the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the main point is about transit probability.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that a planet is more likely to transit if its orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital distance is such that the star's apparent size relative to the planet's orbit is larger. Oh wait, the formula for the transit probability involves the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Or maybe it's about the star's size relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, I think the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, wait, no. I think the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star. It's something like (R_star / a). So the probability is higher when R* is larger or when a is smaller.

So, in the problem, both stars have the same radius. Oh, the question says that both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2.

So the probability for each planet would be proportional to (R_star / a). Since R is same, the probability is inversely proportional to a. So the planet with a smaller a (orbital period) has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait, another thing: the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G(M+m) * P^2) / (4π²). Since the planet mass m is much smaller than the star mass M, we can approximate M as the star's mass. So a ≈ cube root( (G M P²)/(4π²) ). But more importantly, a is proportional to (P^2 * M)^1/3.

Wait, the mass of the star matters. Let me think: Kepler's third law is a^3 ∝ (M * P²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

Given that, let's compute a for each planet.

Planet_1 has a
