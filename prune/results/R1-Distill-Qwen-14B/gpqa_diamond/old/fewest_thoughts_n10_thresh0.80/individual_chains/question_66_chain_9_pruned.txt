Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is SMEFT. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible interactions that can be constructed with the Standard Model fields, up to a certain energy scale. It's a way to parameterize beyond the Standard Model physics without committing to a specific new physics model.

Now, about symmetries. I think all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must respect certain fundamental symmetries. Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so any effective theory should also respect this. I think all SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they're built in a way that they transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. Poincare Symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare symmetry implies that the theory is invariant under changes in position and Lorentz transformations. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, and effective theories usually respect Poincare symmetry because they're valid only up to a certain scale, but I might need to think. Wait, no, because effective theories can have non-local terms, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, no, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Poincare includes translations, so if the theory is invariant under translations, it has momentum conservation, which is part of being a local theory. But I'm not sure if Poincare is the same as Lorentz. Maybe I should think about whether SMEFT operators must be Poincare invariant. Or is Lorentz symmetry separate? Well, I think that Poincare symmetry must be respected because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. Wait, no, Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if a theory is Poincare invariant, it must respect both. But do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Hmm. I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must be Lorentz scalars, but I'm not sure if they must all be Poincare invariant. Maybe they do, because the theory as a whole must be Poincare-invariant. So maybe both Lorentz and Poincare are required.

Wait, no. Wait, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. If the theory is Poincare-invariant, then it's also Lorentz-invariant. But the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So maybe the operators must be invariant under Lorentz transformations, which is part of Poincare. Wait, but perhaps all operators are Lorentz scalars, but Poincare invariance would require more, like
