Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So the question says there are five exoplanets, all with circular orbits, found using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? But I think that's more about how they were discovered, not so much about their temperatures. So maybe I can ignore that part for now.

The planets are in orbital resonance, which probably means their orbital periods are in some harmonic ratio. Oh, wait, the question states the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, Planet_3 is 2.5*P1, Planet_4 is 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is 5*P1. Or wait, is the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, meaning each planet's period is that multiple of a base period. So the periods are P1, 2P1, 2.5P1, 3.5P1, 5P1. So, each subsequent planet has a longer orbital period.

They have the same albedo. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because it determines how much light is reflected. Since all are same, maybe that term cancels out.

The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So, T4 over T2.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. For a planet, it's based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4), but wait, maybe a simplified version. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity (L), the planet's albedo (a), and the distance from the star (D). Since all planets orbit the same star (I assume), L is same for all. Also, albedo is same, so a cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the formula can be simplified for the ratio of temperatures. Let me think. The temperature T is proportional to [ (1 - a) / D² ]^(1/4). So T ∝ (1/D²)^(1/4) = 1/(D^(0.5)). Because (1/ D²) to the 1/4 is 1/D^(0.5). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). But wait, D is the distance from the star. So if two planets are at different distances, their temperatures relate inversely with the square root of their distances.

But wait, how are their distances related? Because in Kepler's third law, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance). So P² ∝ D³. So P² = k * D³, where k is some constant.

So for two planets, Planet i and Planet j, their periods are Pi and Pj, and distances Di and Dj. So Pi²/Di³ = Pj²/Dj³.

I need to find the ratio of D4 to D2. So D4 = ( (P4² / P2²) )^(1/3) * D2 ?

Wait, let me think again. Kepler's law: Pi^2 = (4π²/GM) * Di^3. So Pi^2 is proportional to Di^3. So ratio of periods squared is ratio of distances cubed.

So (Pi^2)/(Pj^2) = (Di^3)/(Dj^3). So (Di/Dj) = (Pi/Pj)^(2/3).

So the distance ratio is (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is proportional to (D2/D4)^(1/2). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D).

Wait, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So T4/T2 = (sqrt(D2) ) / (sqrt(D4) ) ) = sqrt( D2 / D4 ) = sqrt( (D2/D4) ).

But D2/D4 is (D2 / D4) = [ (D4/D2) ]^-1. Hmm, maybe I should compute D4 in terms of D2.

So given that Planet_2 has period P2, Planet_4 has period P4. So P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3).

Calculating 3.5/2 is 1.75. So 1.75^(2/3). Let me compute that.

So 1.75 is equal to 7/4, which is 1.75. So 1.75^(2/3).

Hmm, what's 1.75 squared? (1.75)^2 = 3.0625. Now, taking the cube root of that, because 1.75^(2/3) is the same as (1.75^2)^(1/3) = (3.0625)^(1/3).

What's the cube root of 3.0625? Let's think. 1.4^3 is 2.744, 1.45^3 is about 3.05 (since 1.45*1.45=2.1025, 2.1025 *1.45 ≈ 3.0486). So cube root of 3.0625 is approximately 1.45.

So D4/D2 ≈ 1.45.

So the distance ratio D4 is 1.45 times D2. So D4 is farther.

Now, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = ( D2 / D4 )^(1/2) = (1 / 1.45 )^(1/2) = 1 / sqrt(1.45).

What's sqrt(1.45)? Let me calculate. 1.2^2 is 1.44. Oh, so sqrt(1.44) is 1.2. So sqrt(1.45) is a little more than 1.2, say about 1.204.

So 1 / 1.204 ≈ 0.83 (since 1/1.2 is approx 0.8333, so 1/1.204 is about 0.83).

So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck my steps. Because I'm a bit confused on the exact steps.

Let me write it step by step.

1. Orbital periods: P1, 2P1, 2.5P1, 3.5P1, 5P1.

2. For any two planets, the ratio of their distances is (P_i / P_j)^(2/
