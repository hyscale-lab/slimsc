Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. An electron is in a spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the operator and the state vector.

Wait, the state is given as (3i, 4). So that's a two-component vector. I think this is a column vector in the Hilbert space for spin-1/2 particles. The expectation value formula is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, right? And S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis.

Oh, right, the Pauli matrices. The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And since S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

So the expectation value would be the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by S_y, then multiplied by the state vector. Let me write this step by step.

First, the state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose, ψ†, would be [ -3 (since 3i* is -3i?), wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the original vector is (3i, 4). So ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*]. Since 3i is a complex number, its conjugate is -3i? Wait, wait no. Wait, no, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, no, wait. No, wait. 3i is written as 3 multiplied by i. So the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i. Because the conjugate of i is -i. So ψ† would be [-3i, 4]. Wait, no, the components are (3i, 4), so their conjugates are (-3i, 4* would be 4, since it's real). So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Because 3i is the first component, so its conjugate is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Wait, but the state was given as (3i, 4). So the components are ψ₁ = 3i and ψ
