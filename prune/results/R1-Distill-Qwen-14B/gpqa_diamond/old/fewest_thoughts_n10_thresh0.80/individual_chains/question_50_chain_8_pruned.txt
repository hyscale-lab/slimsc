Okay, so I need to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given size estimate expression. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process and the number of vertices or propagators, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact connection.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) *8 *1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break this down. The constants involved are things like the fine-structure constant alpha, maybe a coupling constant g, and some factors from integrals or symmetry considerations.

I think the key here is the dimensionless factors that come from loop integrals. Each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) in four-dimensional spacetime because the integral over the loop momentum gives a term like 1/( (4 pi)^2 ) multiplied by some logarithmic terms or other factors depending on the diagram. But wait, each loop would contribute something like 1/(16 pi^2) each, so for L loops, it would be (1/(16 pi^2))^L.

Wait, looking at the expression, I see (1/(4 pi)^6). Let me compute that: (1/(4 pi))^6 = 1/(4^6 pi^6) = 1/(4096 pi^6). But each loop contributes 1/(16 pi^2) = 1/(4^2 pi^2). So for L loops, it's (1/(4^2 pi^2))^L = 1/(4^(2L) pi^(2L)).

But in the given expression, it's (1/(4 pi))^6. So 4 pi is appearing 6 times. Let's see: (4 pi)^6 = 4^6 pi^6. So in the denominator, we have 4^6 pi^6. 

So, if each loop contributes (1/(4 pi)^2 ), because 16 pi^2 is (4 pi)^2, then each loop would bring a (1/(4 pi)^2) factor. So wait, no, each loop is (1/(4 pi)^2) to the power of L, I think. Because each loop has an integral that gives 1/(4
