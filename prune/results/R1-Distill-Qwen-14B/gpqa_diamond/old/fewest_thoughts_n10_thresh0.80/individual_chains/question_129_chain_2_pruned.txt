Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and think through each step.

The question involves a reaction scheme with compounds A to E. I need to find out what compound E is, based on the reactions and some hints.

Let me break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints provided:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So compound A must have a carbonyl group because that's what the Wittig reaction targets. The product is an alkene, so the ylide abstracts the carbonyl oxygen and forms a new double bond.

Looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the main ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2C(CH3)=, right? So the structure would have a double bond attached to the cyclopentane ring.

Wait, so when the Wittig reagent (phosphorus ylide) reacts with compound A (which has a carbonyl), it forms this structure. That suggests that compound A must have a carbonyl group adjacent to the ring. Because the Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with a double bond.

So perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let's think: if the product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents, then the starting carbonyl would have been part of the ring. Like, maybe cyclopentanone with some substituents.

Alternatively, if the Wittig forms the double bond, then the starting material (compound A) would have a carbonyl group where the double bond is in the product. So the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that has a double bond.

Wait, let me visualize the product: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)C(CH3)=, so that's a substituent with a double bond attached.

So the Wittig reaction would have added that substituent. So the starting compound A, before the Wittig, must have a carbonyl at position 4. So it's cyclopentanone with substituents.

Wait, but in the product, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, so maybe compound A was a cyclopentanone with a group that becomes this after the Wittig.

Alternatively, perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone with a methyl group at position 4. Because when the Wittig reaction occurs, the carbonyl at position 4 would be converted into a double bond, bringing in the R group from the ylide.

Wait, but the product's substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH2)C(CH3)=. So the ylide must have been derived from an alkyl halide that's (CH2)C(CH3)2P= etc. So the ylide would have the structure P=CH-C(CH3)2, maybe.

Wait, no. Ylides are usually more like PR3=CH- groups. So when the ylide reacts with a carbonyl, it replaces O
