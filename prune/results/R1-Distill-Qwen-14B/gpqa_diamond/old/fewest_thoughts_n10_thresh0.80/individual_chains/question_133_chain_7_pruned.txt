Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) that contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given, 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The Ka1, Ka2, Ka3 values for H3PO4 are provided as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 respectively.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think this is a buffer solution problem because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. KH2PO4 is probably the acid form, and Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which I think is the fully deprotonated form. But wait, H3PO4 can lose three protons, so the species in solution might be H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4), HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4), and maybe some PO4^3-.

Wait, no. Let me think again. KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and K+ (since K is the cation). Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- and Na+ (two Na per molecule). So when they are dissolved, the solution would have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So I'm a bit confused. Do we have any PO4^3- in solution? Because usually, the third dissociation is very small. But maybe with the given concentrations, some PO4^3- might form.

Wait, but the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So this is a buffer system, but how does that relate to PO4^3- concentration?

I remember that in a solution containing a weak acid and its conjugate base, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But here, we might have multiple equilibria since there are three dissociation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and we can use that to find the pH, then see how much PO4^3- is present.

Wait, but the problem is specifically asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. So perhaps I should calculate that.

So, plan: find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- first. Then, use the third dissociation to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, because HPO4^2- can further dissociate to PO4^3- and H+.

So the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, if I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- and the H+ concentration, I can find PO4^3-.

But wait, how do I find the H+ concentration? Maybe using the buffer solution from the first two dissociations.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each substance (KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O) in the solution.

2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- to find the pH.

4. With pH known, calculate the H+ concentration.

5. Then, from HPO4^2- and H+, use the third Ka to find PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-, so we can write the expression for Ka3 and solve for [PO4^3-].

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate moles.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Wait, 136.09 is approximately 136. So 1/136 ≈ 0
