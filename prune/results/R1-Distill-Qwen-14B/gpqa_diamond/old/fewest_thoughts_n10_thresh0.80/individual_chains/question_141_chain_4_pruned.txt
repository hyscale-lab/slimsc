Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. I think that's a typo. Maybe it's 2-bromobenzene-1-d? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Wait, no, 2-d might mean a substituent. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because 'd' could refer to the substituent, like a methyl group attached via a double bond, but wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a substituent at position 2, which is a -d group. But that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is written differently. Wait, perhaps it's 2-bromo-1-dimethylaminobenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but I'm not sure. Wait, the 'd' is throwing me off. Oh! Wait, perhaps the 'd' is a typo and it's actually a methyl group, so 1-bromobenzene-2-d is 1-bromo-2-methyl
