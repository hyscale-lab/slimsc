Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says the Hamiltonian is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Epsilon is an energy constant. I need to find the eigenvalues of H.

Hmm, first, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product sigma · n would be n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z. So H is epsilon multiplied by this sum.

Wait, eigenvalues of a matrix. Oh right, for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But maybe there's a smarter way than expanding the matrix.

I recall that for a Pauli matrix in any direction, say n, the operator sigma · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because each Pauli matrix is traceless and has determinant -1, but when multiplied by a unit vector, the eigenvalues are ±1. Let me think: for sigma_z, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1, same for any other sigma_i.

So if the operator sigma · n has eigenvalues ±1, then multiplying by epsilon would scale them. So H would have eigenvalues epsilon*(+1) and epsilon*(-1), so +epsilon and -epsilon.

Wait, wait, but another thought: the Pauli matrices in any direction have eigenvalues ±1. So H = epsilon * (sigma · n) would have eigenvalues ±epsilon. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B is +epsilon and -epsilon. Option C has factors of hbar/2, but where would that come from? Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm confused because sometimes spin operators are expressed in terms of sigma multiplied by hbar/2. Like S = (hbar/2) sigma. So if H was proportional to S·n, the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon * (hbar/2). But in this problem, H is given as epsilon times sigma · n, not involving hbar. So in this case, the eigenvalues are ±epsilon.

So the correct answer should be option B. Let me check the options again.

Option A is ±1, which
