Okay, so I have this problem about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are given, so I'll have to think through the steps carefully.

Let me start by recalling what equilibrium temperature depends on. I remember it's related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Because both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio, so I don't have to worry about it here.

Wait, wait. The equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is T_planet = T_star * ( (L_star/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) / (4πa^2) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think it can be simplified using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The star emits energy, and the planet absorbs some of it. The equilibrium temperature comes from balancing the absorbed energy with the emitted energy. So the planet's temperature depends on the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2d)), where d is the distance from the star to the planet. Because the star's luminosity is L = 4πR_s²σT_s^
