Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and go through it.

Alright, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. But the question isn't about mass directly; it's about luminosity, right?

The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T of the black body. The formula is λ_max * T = constant, which is about 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K.

So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no, because if λ is the same, then T would be the same. So both stars are at the same temperature. That's an important point.

Then, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But wait, when considering luminosity from black body radiation, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. But the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same. Does that mean we have to consider the Doppler effect?

Wait a second, because if Star_2 is moving towards us (if radial velocity is positive or negative, depending on convention), its observed wavelength would be blueshifted. But in this case, both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. So maybe the Doppler effect is already accounted for in their observed wavelengths. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation here because we're considering their rest wavelengths. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that the observed maximum wavelengths are the same, which would imply that their rest frame temperatures are the same because any Doppler shift would change the observed wavelength. Hmm. Wait, the peak wavelength observed is the same. So, if the stars are moving, their rest wavelengths would differ, but the observed ones are same. But the problem doesn't say anything about their rest wavelengths.

Alternatively, maybe the radial velocity information is a red herring for the luminosity calculation. Because the question is about computing the luminosity based on black body radiation. Since the problem states that they assume black body radiation for the luminosity calculation, perhaps we don't need to consider the Doppler effect for this part.

Wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity, so they must have taken into account any Doppler shifts. But wait, the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So perhaps Star_2's higher radial velocity affects its observed temperature, but the fact that their observed λ_max are same means that when considering their rest frames, their temperatures are same or different?

This is a bit tricky. Let's think again: the peak wavelength observed is the same. But the actual temperature (rest frame) depends on the Doppler shift. So Star_2, which is moving towards us (assuming radial velocity is positive when moving away, but I'm not sure; actually, the sign depends on the convention. Oh wait, radial velocity could be positive when moving away. So 700 km/s would mean moving away, which would cause a redshift. But if the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1, which has 0 radial velocity, perhaps the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher to compensate for the redshift. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer (redshift), but since the observed λ is same, its actual λ must be shorter (so higher temperature) to make observed λ the same.

Wait, let's clarify Wien's Law. The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest and the Doppler factor. For a source moving away with velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ would be larger than its rest λ. But in the problem, both stars have the same observed λ. That means Star_2's rest wavelength must be smaller than Star_1's. Because λ_obs for Star_2 is λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). Similarly, for Star_1, v1 is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). So λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 + v2/c). Because v2 is 700 km/s. Wait, but velocity is a big number compared to c (speed of light is about 3e5 km/s), so 700 is much smaller. So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1. So maybe the Doppler shift is negligible, but perhaps it's still a factor.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the implications. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that the stars' rest wavelengths are the same. Because if you have the same λ_max, then their temperatures are the same. But if Star_2 is moving away, then the observed λ is longer, so how can it have same observed λ as Star_1? Only if Star_2's rest λ is smaller, which would imply a higher temperature.

Wait, let's compute. Let's say both observed λ are the same, λ_obs. For Star_1, since its velocity is zero, λ_obs = λ_rest1. For Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). Since λ_obs is same for both, λ_rest2 = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) = λ_rest1 / (1 + v2/c).

But since λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature, higher λ_rest implies lower temperature. So if Star_2's λ_rest is smaller than Star_1's, then Star_2's temperature is higher. Because λ_rest ∝ 1/T.

Alternatively, let me write the equations.

Wien's Law: λ_max * T = constant.

So for Star_1: λ1 * T1 = constant.

For Star_2: λ2 * T2 = same constant.

But the observed λ is the same for both. So, λ
