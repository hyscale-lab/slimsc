Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. 

Alright, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but relative to each other, right? I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)) or something like that. Wait, but wait, which one is moving in which frame?

Wait, maybe I should figure out which astronaut is moving faster. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from Earth's frame, astronaut A (2m) is moving faster than astronaut B (3m). But the question is about their relative speed. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, the relative speed from A's perspective would be how much faster B is moving relative to A. Or wait, no, because from A's frame, B is moving at a different speed. Hmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of reference frames.

Wait, the relative speed is how fast one is moving as seen from the other's frame. So the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), right? So u is the speed of the second object in the first's frame. Let me get this straight.

Let me think: if I'm in the frame of astronaut A (mass 2m, moving at 0.6c), then what is the speed of astronaut B (3m, moving at 0.5c in Earth's frame) according to A's frame? So the formula should be (v' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) ), where u is the speed of the Earth frame as seen from A, and v is the speed of B in the Earth frame.

Wait, no. Wait
