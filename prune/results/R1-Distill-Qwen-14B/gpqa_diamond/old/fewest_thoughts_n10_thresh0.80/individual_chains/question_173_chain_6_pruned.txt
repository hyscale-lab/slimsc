Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron's uncertainty in energy. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this relates to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Let me think about how that works.

The question says the electron is traveling at a speed v of 2x10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that there's a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The principle is often written as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, since we're given Δx, we can find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Then, using that, we can find the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. But how exactly?

I think the uncertainty in momentum is related to kinetic energy. Because the electron's momentum is p = mv, but since we're dealing with uncertainties, it's Δp. But wait, the kinetic energy K.E. is (p²)/(2m), so any uncertainty in p would lead to an uncertainty in energy.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using Δx. Heisenberg's principle gives Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx). Or wait, sometimes the formula uses Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). But for estimation, maybe we can take Δp ≈ ħ
