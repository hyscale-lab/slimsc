Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at a concentration of 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The stability constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, each with different concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex, so the metal is more tightly bound.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So, [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. Since EDTA usually binds in a 1:1 ratio with metal ions, the complex would be CaEDTA^2- or something similar.

But wait, in solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. The formation of the complex is given by the equation: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is 5e10.

So, the stability constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Since the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions (so the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are both zero, and the complex is formed), but wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, then that's the concentration when it's all formed. But in reality, some of it dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA.

But wait, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the solution starts with some Ca^2+ and EDTA, which form the complex. But the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA. Hmm, perhaps that means that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that the total concentration of Ca and EDTA comes from that complex and any dissociated ions.

Wait, but for a 1:1 complex, the total concentration would be [CaEDTA^2-] + [Ca^2+] + [EDTA^4-] = 0.02 M if the solution was initially made by mixing Ca and EDTA to form the complex. But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think that might mean that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the rest comes from the dissociation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, and it's the only source of Ca and EDTA, then the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would be zero. But then, the complex can dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So the solution is in equilibrium between the complex and its ions.

So, let's set up the equilibrium. Let's let the concentration of Ca-EDTA be 0.02 M at the start. Then, when some of it dissociates, the change would be: 

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x
[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Because each mole of complex that dissociates gives one mole of each ion. So, substituting into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02 - x)/(x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, but wait. If K is so large (5e10), that implies that the complex is very stable. So, the dissociation x would be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, we can approximate (0.02)/(x^2) ≈ 5e10. Solving for x:

x^2 ≈ 0.02 / 5e10 → x^2 ≈ 4e-13 → x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) → x ≈ 2e-6.5? Wait, wait. Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So, x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5?

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, 6.5 is the exponent. But 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, because 1e-7 is 1e-7, and 1e-6 is 1e-6. So, 2e-6.5 is approximately 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of calcium ions would be about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, let me double-check. So, K is 5e10. The complex is 0.02 M. We assumed that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then, 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x= sqrt(0.4e-12) → sqrt(0.4) is about 0.632, so 0.632e-6 = 6.32e-7 M.

Which matches option C: 6.3e-7 M.

So, the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The stability constant is expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and assuming the dissociation is small (due to the large \( K \)), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
