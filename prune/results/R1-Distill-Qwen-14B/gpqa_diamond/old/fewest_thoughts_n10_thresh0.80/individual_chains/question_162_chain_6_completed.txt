Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, first, I need to remember what a pseudosphere is. From what I recall, a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, often represented as the tractricoid, which is the surface of revolution of the tractrix. But I'm not entirely sure about the details.

The question gives me a metric:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

I think this is a 2-dimensional metric, so it's probably describing the geometry of some surface. The question is about finding the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The metric is written in terms of x and y, but the pseudosphere is usually parametrized using different variables, maybe something like u and v or in terms of hyperbolic functions. Oh wait, maybe I can figure out the type of coordinates we're dealing with here.

Let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks similar to the expression you see in the metric for a sphere, but with a positive sign. For a sphere of radius a, the metric is often written as (a²/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but this is in polar coordinates. Here, the given metric is in Cartesian coordinates. So perhaps this is a conformally flat metric, which is a metric that can be written as a scalar function multiplied by the Euclidean metric.

Wait, conformal metrics are often used in various geometries. For example, in the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space, the metric is (4/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. Comparing that to the given metric, the denominator here is (4 - x² - y²) which, in polar coordinates r (with x² + y² = r²) becomes (4 - r²). So the given metric seems to be similar to the Poincaré disk model, but scaled differently.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model for 2D hyperbolic space, the metric is (4/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Here, our given metric is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Converting to polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so the metric becomes (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Comparing to the standard Poincaré disk, which is (4/(4 - r²)), the given metric is 8 times larger. So maybe this is a scaled version.

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk has curvature K = -1/(a²), where a is the radius of the disk. The metric there is (4/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So if our metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), that's 8 times the standard. Hmm, that scaling must relate to the curvature somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere of radius 2. I remember that the pseudosphere has a constant negative curvature. The metric for a pseudosphere can be written in different forms, perhaps similar to the hyperbolic space.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. The pseudosphere itself is a surface in 3D space, but perhaps the question is referring to the area of a region in this metric. Wait, no, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." That sounds a bit odd because a pseudosphere is a surface, not a volume. Maybe it's asking about the area of the surface, which would be the area of the tractricoid.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric represents the pseudosphere, and the question is about the area of the entire space described by this metric. Wait, but the metric given is for 2D, so maybe it's the area of a specific region, like the whole hyperbolic plane. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the options include 4π(x² + y²), 4π(x² - y²), 0, and infinity. These look like they could be expressions for area, but options B and C have x and y terms, which suggests they might not be the correct answer because the area should be a constant, not dependent on position.

Option A is 0, which doesn't make sense for an area. Option D is infinity, which is possible if the area is unbounded. So the question is: is the area finite or infinite?

Wait, the given metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). The denominator becomes zero when x² + y² =4, so the metric blows up at x² + y² =4. That suggests that the space is a model of hyperbolic space with a curvature, but perhaps the entire space is bounded within the circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, no, the standard Poincaré disk model has the entire hyperbolic plane mapped into a disk of radius 4, perhaps? Or wait, in the standard Poincaré disk, the curvature K is -1, and the disk has radius a, where a is related to the curvature. Wait, maybe the radius of the disk is related to the curvature. For K=-1, the radius is 1. Hmm, I might be getting confused.

Wait, the metric given is (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²) in polar coordinates. The standard Poincaré disk for K=-1 is (4/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So our given metric is 8 times the standard metric. That suggests that the curvature here would be different.

Wait, in the standard case, the line element is (4/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). If our metric is (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), then 32 is 8 times 4. So the curvature would be different. The curvature K is given by K = - (1/a²), where a is the radius of the disk. Wait, maybe I should relate the metric to the curvature.

But perhaps I'm getting sidetracked. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, the pseudosphere itself is a surface of constant negative curvature, but the term "pseudosphere of radius r=2" – I'm not sure about the exact definition here. Maybe it's the area of the surface, which, for a pseudosphere, is infinite because it's a surface of revolution that extends infinitely? Or perhaps not.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a finite surface. It's a surface of revolution of the tractrix, and it has finite surface area. Let me think: I remember that the pseudosphere has finite surface area. The formula for the surface area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is 4π a², where a is the radius of the pseudosphere. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the tractrix has a certain parametrization, and when you revolve it around its asymptote, you get the pseudosphere. The area of the pseudosphere is 4π a², but I'm not certain about the exact expression.

But back to the metric given: the denominator is 4 - x² - y². This suggests that the maximum radius in terms of x and y is 2, because beyond that, the denominator becomes zero and the metric blows up. So maybe this metric is describing a hyperbolic plane with a certain curvature, but it's limited to a disk of radius 2, making it a finite space.

Wait, if the denominator is 4 - x² - y², then the domain of x² + y² is less than 4. So the space described by this metric is within a circle of radius 2. That suggests that the area might be finite. Because if you integrate the area element over a finite region, you get a finite area.

Let me compute the area element. The area element in 2D for a metric g is sqrt(g) dx dy. Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since this is a conformally flat metric, the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², but wait, no, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))², where r²=x²+y².

Wait, wait, the determinant of a 2x2 diagonal metric diag(A, B) is AB. So in this case, A = B = 32/(4 - r²). So determinant is (32/(4 - r²))². So the square root of the determinant is 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dr dθ in polar coordinates.

So the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π of (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. Because in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ.

So let me set up the integral:

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

We can separate the integrals since the integrand doesn't depend on θ.

So Area = (32) * ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) dθ ) * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr

Compute ∫ dθ from 0 to 2π: that's 2π.

So Area = 32 * 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr

Now compute the integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = ∫ (1/u) * (-1/2) du = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2, u=4 -4=0.

Wait a minute, wait. When r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from the positive side. Let me check the substitution:

At r=0, u=4. At r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

(-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from u=4 to u=0.

So, [ (-1/2) ( ln(0) - ln(4) ) ]

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral diverges to positive infinity because ln(0) is -infty, so -ln(0) is +infty.

Wait, but does that mean the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is divergent?

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the integral diverges, then the area would be infinite.

But wait, let me double-check the substitution. The substitution is correct. The integral becomes [(-1/2)(ln u)] from u=4 to u=0.

So it's (-1/2)(ln 0 - ln 4) = (-1/2)( (-infty) - ln4 ) = (-1/2)( -infty - finite ) → which is (-1/2)(-infty) = positive infinity.

So the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite.

But earlier, I thought the pseudosphere is a finite surface. But this metric might not be representing the entire pseudosphere but a model of hyperbolic space in a finite disk. So perhaps the area is infinite because the hyperbolic plane has infinite area, even when represented in the Poincaré disk model. Because the model maps the entire hyperbolic plane into a finite disk, but the area element still integrates to an infinite area.

Wait, but in the Poincaré disk model, the area element is similar, and the total area is indeed infinite. Because even though the coordinate system is confined to the disk of radius 4, the area element accumulates to an infinite area.

So perhaps the metric given is that of the hyperbolic plane within a disk of radius 2, and the area is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. If the pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, perhaps it's a finite area, but in this case, the metric given seems to model an infinite hyperbolic space within a finite region, leading to an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the pseudosphere is being considered. Let me think: The tractricoid (pseudosphere) has a finite surface area. The formula for the surface area is 4π a², where a is the radius of the pseudosphere. If the radius is 2, then the area would be 4π (2)^2 = 16π. But none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: 4π(x² + y²)
Option C: 4π(x² - y²)
Option A: 0
Option D: +infty

Hmm, those options don't include 16π. So perhaps I was mistaken in thinking the area is finite. Maybe the given metric isn't representing the pseudosphere surface but the hyperbolic space it's embedded in.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given metric is the metric of the pseudosphere, which would be a 2D surface. So the area would be the integral of the area element over the entire surface.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, so its area is finite. But the given metric is a 2D metric, so perhaps it's describing the intrinsic metric of the pseudosphere.

Wait, the intrinsic metric of the pseudosphere is indeed a hyperbolic metric. So the area of the entire pseudosphere would be finite, but perhaps the given metric is only a part of it or it's extended infinitely.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area, so the area would be infinite. But if the metric is limited to a certain radius, the area might be finite.

Wait, but our earlier calculation suggested that the integral diverges. So perhaps the area is infinite.

But wait, let me re-examine the setup. The metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, r² = x² + y², and the denominator is (4 - r²). The maximum r is 2, but the integral for the area goes up to r=2.

So the area integral is:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

As we saw earlier, the integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2 is divergent. So the area is infinite.

Which would make option D the correct answer.

But wait, the pseudosphere of radius 2, is that a different case? I'm getting a bit confused because I'm mixing up the geometry of the metric provided and the geometry of the pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is not the intrinsic metric of the pseudosphere but an embedding in 3D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The pseudosphere is a surface of revolution with constant negative curvature. The area of the pseudosphere is finite, while the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. So if the given metric describes a hyperbolic plane, its area would be infinite. But if it describes a finite region like a pseudosphere, the area would be finite.

But according to the metric, the space is 2D and has a curvature that blows up at r=2. So integrating the area element from 0 to 2 leads to an infinite area. Therefore, the area is infinite, which would be option D.

So the answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric in 2D, where the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) suggests that the space is bounded within a circle of radius \(2\) in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space, but scaled by a factor of \(8\). The curvature of the space is negative, and the metric blows up at \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\), indicating a singularity at the boundary of the disk.

To compute the area of the space described by this metric, we calculate the area element. For a 2D metric, the area element is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\). Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is \(\left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\), and the square root of the determinant is \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), the area element becomes:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Separating the integrals:

\[
A = 32 \cdot \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta\) evaluates to \(2\pi\). For the radial integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr\), we use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-1}{2u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \ln|u| \Big|_4^0.
\]

At \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\), and at \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\). Thus:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \ln(0) - \frac{1}{2} \ln(4).
\]

Since \(\ln(0) = -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). This means the total area is infinite. The given metric describes a hyperbolic space with negative curvature, and while the space is confined within a disk of radius \(2\), the area element accumulates to an infinite total area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
