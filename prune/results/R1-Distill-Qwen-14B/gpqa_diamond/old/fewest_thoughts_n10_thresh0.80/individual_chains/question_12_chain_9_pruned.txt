Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the pion (Pi+) is stationary and it decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. The rest masses given are Pi+ is 139.6 MeV and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, maybe considered massless in these calculations?

Right, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So, the muon and the neutrino each will have some kinetic energy. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy of the system before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest
