Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, right? The solution contains 1.00 gram of KH2PO4 and 1.00 gram of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, and the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

The problem also gives me the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. I remember that these K values tell us about the strength of each dissociation step of phosphoric acid.

So, I think the plan here is to calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution and then figure out how they interact. Since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which are phosphate salts, their dissociation will contribute to the phosphate ions in the solution. But wait, I need to think about which species are present.

First, let's break down each salt.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Then, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two water molecules. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (but wait, I think the formula might be Na2HPO4, which breaks into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-). So each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. But how do these relate to the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-?

I remember that phosphoric acid (H3PO4) can lose three protons in three steps:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, in solution, the species present are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this case, the salts provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how do these ions affect each other? Because H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can lose a proton (become PO4^3-) or gain a proton (become H2PO4^-).

So, the solution is a buffer system because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). But wait, wait. H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. So their presence in solution will affect each other's dissociation.

I think I need to calculate the concentrations of each ion, then use the appropriate K expressions to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So maybe I can relate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO
