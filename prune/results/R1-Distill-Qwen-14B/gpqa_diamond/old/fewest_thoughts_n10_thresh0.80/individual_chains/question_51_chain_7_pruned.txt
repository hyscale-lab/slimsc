Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.

The question says that a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are all different expressions involving k, q, d, and R, so I should probably recall some concepts about conductors and electric potential energy.

Wait, I remember that when a conducting sphere is grounded, it means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow in or out. But in this case, do we have any free charges on the sphere? Initially, the sphere is neutral because it's grounded, right? But when we place a charge near it, maybe the sphere will induce some charges. Oh wait, no, because the sphere is conducting, the induced charges would redistribute. But since it's grounded, any induced charges would cause current to flow until the potential is the same as the Earth. Wait, maybe not, because the charge q is outside.

Wait a second, when I place a charge q outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. But because the sphere is grounded, the induced charges would cause the sphere to have a charge that brings the potential at its surface to zero. So the sphere would have an induced charge opposite to q, such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Or wait, maybe the sphere's potential becomes equal to the ground
