Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. And we're supposed to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, and from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards them. That makes sense because in inertial frames, the relative motion is opposite. So if in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at v, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy would be moving at -v. But here, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that means the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is also 60,000 km/s, right? Because velocities just swap signs in opposite frames when moving at the same speed towards each other.

So the problem is essentially about two objects moving towards each other at 60,000 km/s each. But wait, no. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy moves at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So that seems consistent.

Now, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no. Because the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, but the time is measured in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, I think this is a problem involving time dilation. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check the speed: 60,000 km/s. Wait, the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So
