Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize that structure. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is an isopropenyl group, right? So that's a CH2 connected to a CH2 with a double bond, so like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but in the substituent. So it's a vinyl group attached at the C2? No, wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2? Or maybe it's CH2-C(CH2)=CH? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2- as the substituent attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, no. Let me correct that. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)-. So the substituent is a vinylic group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So it's like CH2-C(CH2)-, but actually, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double between 1 and 2. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double between 1 and 2, but wait, that would be propene. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the middle carbon? Hmm, perhaps it's more accurately CH2-C(H)=CH2. Wait, no
