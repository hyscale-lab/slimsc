Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with optical activity. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. There are seven compounds listed, and I need to determine which ones are chiral, meaning they have a stereocenter or some other form that causes them to have enantiomers. Remember, a compound is optically active if it has a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry or something like that.

Let me go one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Hmm. Wait, this is a chloroalkene. Let me draw the structure. So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe but-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure should be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 is Cl-CH2-? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But in this case, substituting for the 1-chloro and 2-methyl. So it's Cl on C1, and a methyl group on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, that can't be because but-1-ene is four carbons with double bond starting at 1. So the structure would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's butane, not butene. Oh, wait, but-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is one end of the double bond. And 2-methyl: so on the second carbon, which is the other end of the double bond, a methyl group. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's three carbons. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so maybe it's CH
