Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. It's a reaction series problem, and the question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, okay, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are about the different types of symmetry a molecule has, like point groups.

Let me read the problem again. 

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Then D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out the structure of E and then determine its molecular symmetry group.

Wait, let's break this down step by step. Let's assign what each compound could be based on the reactions.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. Bright red product. Hmm, bright red color often indicates something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. But 8 equivalents of B. So maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2? Because 8 O2 would mean each A is combining with 8 O atoms. Wait, O2 is diatomic, so 8 equivalents would be 8 moles, but each O2 molecule has two O atoms. So 8 moles of O2 would be 16 O atoms. So if A is reacting with 8 O2 molecules, that's 16 O atoms. So perhaps A is something like S (sulfur), which when oxidized forms SO4^2- or something else.

Wait, but then C could be a compound with A and O. If A is S, then S + O2 forms SO3^2- or something else? Wait, but maybe A is another element. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal like Fe. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be forming a sulfide or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, and B is O2. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the formation of a metal oxide. But 8 equivalents of B (gas) per A. Let me think about the oxidation states. If B is O2, and each O is -2, then 8 O atoms would contribute 16- charge. So if A is a metal, say M, then M^(n+) would balance that. For example, if M is Ca (Ca^2+), then 8 O would give CaO4^4-? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the product C is something like FeO4^2- or another high oxidation state. Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. Let me think about sulfur. S + O2 → SO3? Wait, but sulfur in +6 oxidation state. Or maybe another element.

Alternatively, perhaps the bright red product is Fe(OH)3? No, that's more of a reddish-brown precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the second reaction is C reacting with D to form E. And D is a gas. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents are often polar, maybe like water or something else. Wait, if D and B (gas) react in 1:1 ratio, what could that be? If B is O2, and D is H2, then H would be H2O. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, H would be HCl? No, but HCl is a gas too. Wait, but H is a solvent, which is usually a liquid. So maybe H is H2O. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. But wait, O2 and H2 reacting would require a catalyst, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then H would be HCl, which is a gas, but not a solvent. Hmm, perhaps not. Another possibility: B is O2 and D is another gas like CO. Then H could be COO or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2SO3 (weak). So C might be a sulfate or sulfite? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (which is weak, but I'm not sure if that's the case here).

Wait, if C is a sulfite (SO3^2-), then reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (which is H2S O3, sulfurous acid, a weak acid). But if F is a strong acid, maybe something else. Alternatively, if C is a sulfate, then with water it would produce H2SO4 (strong acid). Wait, but then what about another acid?

Hmm, perhaps C is a mixed anion. Alternatively, maybe C contains both sulfate and sulfite ions. Or perhaps it's a more complex structure.

Wait, going back. Let's think about the first reaction: A plus 8 B gives C. If B is O2, then 8 O2 would mean 16 O atoms. So A would need to have a valency that can form a compound with 16 O atoms. For example, if A is S, which has a valency of -2 (in sulfide), but wait, S in +6 state in SO4^2- (sulfate). Wait, SO4^2- has one S and four O. So if C is a sulfate, then perhaps A is S, but 8 equivalents of O2 would mean 8 O2 molecules, 16 O atoms. So how would that fit?

Wait, maybe A is Fe (iron), and B is O2. So FeO4^2- is a thing, called ferrate(VI). So A is Fe, B is O2. Fe reacting with O2 to form FeO4^2-? But does FeO4^2- form a bright red product? I'm not sure. Alternatively, FeO4^2- is more of a yellowish color, I think. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is Cl and B is O2. So ClO4^- is perchlorate, which is a bright yellow color. Oh wait, perchlorate salts are often yellow or orange. But the product is bright red, so maybe not.

Wait, another compound: MnO4^- is permanganate, which is purple. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide. Wait, but if A is S, reacting with O2 would form SO3, but that's not common. Maybe it's SO2 or something else.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur (S), B is O2, and C is SO3. But SO3 is a liquid, I think. Or maybe when S reacts with O2 in excess, it forms SO3, but I'm not sure about the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps C is a more complex oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is forming a compound like CuO, but then 8 equivalents of O2 would be too much. Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. Let's think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the later reactions. C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So E could be something like chlorine gas (but that's a gas, but the reaction is between C and D, which could be gases or solids). Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene, which is highly toxic. Or maybe E is a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So if B is O2 and D is H2, H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So D is H2, B is O2. So D is H2, which is a gas. Then, when C reacts with D (H2) in the presence of a catalyst, perhaps, to form E.

Wait, let me outline possible structures.

Assuming B is O2 and D is H2:

So the first reaction: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red).

Hmm, what solid A reacts with O2 to form a bright red product? Maybe Fe? Or perhaps it's a transition metal forming a high oxidation state oxide. Wait, what about Fe(III) oxide? Fe2O3 is reddish, but I'm not sure about bright red. Alternatively, maybe it
