Okay, so I have this question about astronomy and redshifts. Hmm, I remember that redshift has to do with how light from distant objects stretches in wavelength due to the expansion of the universe. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, Lyman alpha is a specific emission line. Oh right, the Lyman alpha line is emitted when an electron in hydrogen drops from the second energy level to the first. In the rest frame of the hydrogen, it's in the ultraviolet range, around 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. But for distant objects, this wavelength is stretched by the redshift.

So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. Right, that's the redshift formula. So if the quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen clouds, the absorption line we see would be at a longer wavelength.

But wait, the question is about detecting these clouds using optical telescopes. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths in the range of 400 nm to about 700 nm, I think. So if the observed Lyman alpha line is in the optical range, that would mean higher redshifts. But if the redshift is too low, the absorbed wavelength might still be in the ultraviolet, which optical telescopes can't see. Because the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to much UV light, so ground-based telescopes can't observe those wavelengths.

So the Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) is in the far ultraviolet. If the redshift is such that when we observe it, it's shifted into the optical range, then ground-based telescopes can detect it. So the minimum redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just about in the optical.

Wait, but what's the threshold for optical? Let me think. Visible light starts roughly at about 400 nm (violet) up to 700 nm (red). So the shortest wavelength optical is 400 nm. So the Lyman alpha line would need to be redshifted to 400 nm to be just visible.

So let's set up the equation: lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). We want lambda_obs to be 400 nm. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 1216 Angstroms. So if we have lambda_obs = 400 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms.

So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Let's solve for z.

Divide both sides by 1216: 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.292. So 1 + z ≈ 3.292 → z ≈ 2.292. So approximately 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9. So 2.29 is closer to 2.4, but wait, wait. Because the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimum z where the line is detected. So if the object has a lower z, the observed wavelength would be longer than 400 nm? No, wait, higher z makes the observed wavelength longer. So if the object's at z=2.29, the line is at 400 nm. If the object is at a lower z, the observed wavelength is shorter than 400, which is UV, so not detectable by optical telescopes.

So the lower limit on z is just over 2.29. The options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So the next higher option is C) 2.4. But wait, wait. Because the question is about the lower limit. So the minimum z where the line is at 400 nm. If the object has a z higher than that, then the line is redshifted to longer wavelengths, which are still in optical. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. So to be detected, the z must be above 2.29. Therefore, the lower limit is about 2.3.

Looking at the options, 2.4 is option C. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe the telescope can observe into the near-UV. Some telescopes have instruments that go a bit into the UV, but I think most ground-based optical telescopes can't see below about 300 nm or so. Wait, no, the atmosphere is pretty opaque to UV, so even near-UV is hard. For example, the atmosphere is transparent in the near-UV for certain windows, but the cutoff is around 300 nm or so. So maybe the optical range considered here starts at 300 nm, not 400.

If I use 300 nm as the lower cutoff, let me recalculate.

Lambda_obs = 300 nm. So 300 = 121.6 * (1+z). 300 / 121.6 ≈ 2.468. So 1+z ≈2.468 → z≈1.468.

So z ≈1.47. So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. Now, looking at the options, the closest higher option is option D) 1.9 or option B)1.2. So 1.47 is between B and D. So if the cutoff is 300 nm, then the minimum z is about 1.47, which is between 1.2 and 1.9.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Different sources might consider what's the limit. The question says "optical ground-based telescopes". So what is the typical range they can observe?

Another approach: The Lyman limit is at about 91 nm, but that's not directly relevant here. The Lyman alpha line is 121 nm. For ground-based telescopes, the atmospheric window for optical is from about 320 nm (
