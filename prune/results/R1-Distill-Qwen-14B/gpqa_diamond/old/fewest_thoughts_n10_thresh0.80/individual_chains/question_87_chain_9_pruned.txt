Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about a di-substituted six-membered aromatic ring compound that has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Also, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let me start by breaking down the information. A six-membered aromatic ring means it's probably benzene-based. Di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. The total of 8 carbons: benzene has 6, so the two substituents add 2 carbons. Wait, no, because each substituent could add more than one carbon. Wait, wait, wait. Wait the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. Each substituent is probably a group attached to the ring. The total number of carbons is 8, so 6 from the benzene, and two substituents contributing 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, that doesn't make sense because di-substituted implies two groups.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons, so substituents add 2 more. So each substituent is one carbon each? Like maybe two substituents each with one carbon, such as two methyl groups? But wait, but the FTIR says there's a carbonyl group. So one substituent is a carbonyl group, which would probably be a ketone or an aldehyde or something like that. And the other substituent is an aromatic-halogen bond—so maybe a halogen like Cl or Br attached as a substituent.

Wait, aromatic-halogen bond—so one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). The other substituent is a carbonyl group. Because the IR shows both a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen (like C-Cl or C-Br). So the structure must have two substituents: one is a halogen, the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but substituents in benzene can't have a carbonyl directly attached unless it's something like a ketone.
