Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left, and its Lorentz factor is 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and since energy and momentum must be conserved, the system's total energy and momentum before annihilation must equal the total after.

Let me recall the concepts. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for this problem, maybe I don't need to compute velocities directly. Instead, I should focus on the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision.

Wait, the electron and positron have equal but opposite charges. The electron is moving left to right, while the positron is moving right to left. Since they annihilate, they must have opposite momenta, but wait, is that the case here? Let me think.

Wait, no. The electron is moving along the horizontal from the left, so its velocity is to the right. The positron is moving from the right towards the left? Or wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal from the right. Wait, so the positron is coming from the right and moving towards the left? Wait, the question says: an electron is moving from the left, and the positron is moving from the right. So their directions are opposite.

Wait, no. The electron is moving along the horizontal from the left, meaning it's moving to the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal from the right, so it's moving to the left. So their directions are opposite. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but their momenta would be opposite, but since the positron has a different Lorentz factor, their energies and momenta are different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total energy and total momentum of the system before collision.

So, the electron has gamma = 4, and the positron has gamma = 2. Let me denote the positron as the anti-particle, so its momentum is opposite to the electron's.

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is towards the left. So if the electron's velocity is to the right (positive x-direction), the positron's velocity is to the left (negative x-direction). So their momenta would be in opposite directions.

Wait, but for momentum, direction matters. So the total momentum is the sum of the individual momenta.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify the frame of reference. The problem is in one dimension (horizontal), so let's model their momenta as vectors along this line.

So each particle has a momentum. The electron's momentum is gamma * m_e * v_e, and the positron's is gamma' * m_e * v_pos. But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative.

Wait, but wait. Both
