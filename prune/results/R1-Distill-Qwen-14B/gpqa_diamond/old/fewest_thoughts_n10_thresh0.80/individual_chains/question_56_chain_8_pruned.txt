Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the H-atom. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct transition route and the corresponding probability.

Wait, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen through dipole transitions, which are governed by the selection rules. The selection rules for the hydrogen atom in non-relativistic theory are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh right, and for electrons, the transitions are electric dipole, so these selection rules apply.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. We need to go down to |1,0,0⟩. But since each transition can only change l by ±1, going from l=0 to l=0 in a single step isn't allowed. Because Δl has to be ±1, so you can't have Δl=0. So the transition must occur in two steps.

So from n=3, l=0, m=0. First transition, change l from 0 to 1 (since Δl can be +1), which would take us to n=2, l=1, m=0? Because m can change by 0, ±1. But wait, wait, wait, in the first step, the transition would be from |3,0,0⟩ to either |2,1, m⟩ where m is 0, ±1. Because the selection rules allow m to change by 0, ±1. So possible m values after first transition could be -1, 0, +1.

Then from there, to reach |1,0,0⟩, the next step must change l from 1 to 0. So Δl = -1. So let's think: from |2,1,m⟩, we need to transition to |1,0,m'⟩, again with m changing by 0, ±1.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so m is 0. Let me think about the possible transitions.

First step: |3,0,0⟩ can go to states where l=1. So possible states are |2,1, m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, from each of these, in the next transition, we go to l=0. So m must change by 0, ±1. So for each possible m in the intermediate state, what m's are allowed in the final state?

Let's see:

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1, 0⟩.
From here, m can go to -1, 0, +1 in the next step. But since the final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has m=0, the transition from m=0 can go to m=0.

So that's possible. So |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. But wait, does that happen? Because from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩, and then to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but another possibility is that in the first step, the transition goes to |2,1,1⟩ or |2,1,-1⟩, and then in the second step, those could transition to |1,0,0⟩ or others.

So let's calculate the possible paths.

Another thing I remember is that the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element for each step. But the question is about the probability of each route, so perhaps we need to sum the probabilities of all possible paths that lead from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ in two steps.

But wait, the problem says "the transition route and the corresponding probability." So perhaps each option is a possible route, and we need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option D: It's a bit messed up, the first part is incomplete, but I think it's |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. Not sure, but probably.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. Let's think about possible transitions.

First transition: n=3 to n=2, because to have l change by +1, n must decrease by 1 (since l can be maximum n-1). So from n=3, l=0, m=0, to n=2, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

So first step: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩ where m is -1, 0, +1.

Then, from |2,1, m⟩, the second transition must go to n=1, l=0, m=0.

So for each of these m values, can they transition to m=0 in the final state?

Because the selection rule for m is that Δm = 0, ±1. So:

- If the intermediate state has m=0, then the next can go to m=-1, 0, +1. But the final state is m=0, so that's allowed. So one possibility.

- If the intermediate state has m=1, then the next m can go to 0, 1, 2. But the final state is m=0, so from m=1, can you go to m=0? Yes, because Δm = -1 is allowed. So yes.

- Similarly, if the intermediate state is m=-1, then the next m can go to -2, -1, 0. So m=0 is allowed.

So possible transitions:

Path 1: 3s → 2p, m=0 → 1s, m=0.

Path 2: 3s → 2p, m=1 → 1s, m=0.

Path 3: 3s → 2p, m=-1 → 1s, m=0.

So three possible paths. Now, what's the probability for each path, and which options correspond to these.

But the options present specific paths, either via m=0, m=1, or m=-1.

Each path's probability would be the product of the transition probabilities for each step.

Wait, but in the question, what determines the correct probability? I think the transition probabilities depend on the square of the dipole matrix elements, which are given by the Wigner-Eckart theorem. 

The dipole matrix element for a transition from state |n', l', m'⟩ to |n, l, m⟩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l, m | l', m ⟩, but I might be mixing up the exact form. Alternatively, I remember that the probability amplitude for the transition is non
