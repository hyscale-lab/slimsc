Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to select the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, the reactions produce diketones. I remember that the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O is typically involved in the formation of carbonyl groups, maybe through some kind of oxidation or diazotization. Oh wait, diazotization is usually for aromatic amines, but wait, the products here are diketones. So maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another thought. I've heard of the Stephen reduction, but that's for ketones to aldehydes. No, wait, that's with NaBH(OAc)3. Hmm. Or maybe it's a Beckmann rearrangement? No, that's about oximes rearranging into amides.

Wait, wait a minute. I think this is about the formation of ketones from some sort of nitrosation reaction. Oh, maybe it's the production of a carbonyl via the loss of an amino group. Wait, I think when you have a compound with an alcohol group adjacent to a leaving group, like perhaps a nitroso group, it can lead to the formation of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a carbonyl group from an alcohol via oxidation. But HCl, NaNO2, and water—oh, wait! I think this is the von Braun degradation. Or perhaps it's a situation where a nitroso intermediate is formed, leading to elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the reagents. HCl, sodium nitrite, and water. That's a common condition for nitrosation. So maybe the starting materials have a group that can form a diazonium salt which then undergoes some reaction to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the products are diketones. So each starting material must be a compound that can form a diketone. How would that happen?

Let me think about the possible structures. For example, if the starting material has two adjacent alcohol groups, or perhaps two alcohol groups that can be oxidized or dehydrated to form ketones.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: if the starting material has a group that, upon treatment, forms a nitroso intermediate which then loses N2O and forms a carbonyl. For example, if the starting material is a diol—like a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol)—then treatment with nitrous acid might lead to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait! I think this is the case. Vicinal diols (like glycols) when treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) in acidic conditions can undergo a reaction called the oxyamination or the formation of a carbonyl. Oh wait, I remember that when a vicinal diol (like cyclohexane-1,2-diol) is treated with nitrous acid, it can form a carbonyl group. The reaction is known as the Hurd-Mory procedure or something similar.

Wait, no. Let
