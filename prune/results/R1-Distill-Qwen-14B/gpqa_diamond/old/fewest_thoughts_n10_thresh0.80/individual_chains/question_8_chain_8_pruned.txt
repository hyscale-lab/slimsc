Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to anthracnose resistance. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants of each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3).

The key thing they know is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to DNA and promoting or inhibiting transcription.

The results they got after testing with the pathogen are:

- g1 has 75% resistance, which is three-quarters of the control.
- g2 has 0%—so no resistance, all infected.
- g3 has 50%—half the control's resistance.
- The double mutants:
   - g1g3: 10% (very low)
   - g2g3: 0%
   - g1g2: 0%

Hmm. So the wild type is 100%, meaning they're pretty resistant. The mutants have varying levels. Lower percentage means more susceptible.

The question is about the interaction between these genes. The options are about which gene is a TF, whether others show pleiotropy or redundancy, and which is epistatic.

First, I need to think about what these results imply about the gene functions.

Let's start with the single mutants:

- g1 has 75%: so it's less resistant than wild type. So G1 is contributing to resistance. Maybe it's partially functional or its product is not completely absent.

- g2: 0%. So without G2, the plants can't resist the pathogen at all. That's a strong effect. So G2 is critical. Also, since G2 is a candidate for being a transcription factor (since at least one of them is), maybe G2 is the TF.

- g3: 50% resistance. So it's contributing, but less than G1 and G2.

Now looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. But wait, g3 is 50%, and g1 is 75%. So the double is worse than both. Hmm, maybe G1 and G3 are involved in the same pathway, but perhaps they have additive effects or maybe one is downstream.

Wait, but in the double mutants, some of them are 0% resistance. For instance, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%. And g1g3 is 10%.

So, in the cases where either G2 is knocked out (g2, g1g2, g2g3), the resistance is 0%. Which suggests that G2 is perhaps upstream of other genes, including G1 and G3.

Because when G2 is missing, the resistance is gone. So if G2 is a transcription factor, it would activate other genes, like G1 and G3. So without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to loss of resistance.

Looking at the single mutants:

g1 is 75%: So when G1 is knocked out, the plant's resistance is reduced but not gone. That suggests that G1's function contributes but isn't the only pathway. Perhaps G2's product is still present, and it can activate other genes, but not as effectively as when G1 is present.

Wait, let me think again. If G2 is a transcription factor, and it's upstream, then its knockout would prevent all downstream genes from being expressed. But wait, in the g1 mutant, G2 is present but G1 isn't
