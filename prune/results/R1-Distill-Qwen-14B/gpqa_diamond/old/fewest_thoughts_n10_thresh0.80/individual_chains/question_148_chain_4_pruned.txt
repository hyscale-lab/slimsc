Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. Sometimes these multiple-choice questions can be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps.

The question talks about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F. They mention five such compounds. Hmm, I remember that elements in the third period, like sulfur or chlorine, can form several binary compounds with fluorine. But wait, fluorine is pretty reactive, so maybe Y is another halogen? Or perhaps something else.

The first part mentions substance A1, which is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So, when A1 breaks down, it releases F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is an oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a strong oxidizing fluoride.

Wait, what oxidizes xenon? Xenon is usually in the +0 oxidation state. So, if A1 is causing it to oxidize, maybe A1 contains a higher oxidation state of Y. Maybe Y is in a high oxidation state in A1.

A2 has a ωF of 31.96%. Oh, ω is the mass fraction. So, the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 is about 31.96%. Let me calculate what that implies. Suppose A2 is YF_x. The mass of F would be (x * 19) / (atomic weight of Y + 19x) = 0.3196.

Hmm, but without knowing Y or x, it's a bit tough. Maybe I can think of common fluorides. Let me think of some examples. If Y is Cl, for instance. But 31.96% F... Wait, for ClF3: Cl has atomic weight ~35.5, F is 19. So ClF3 would have (3*19)/(35.
