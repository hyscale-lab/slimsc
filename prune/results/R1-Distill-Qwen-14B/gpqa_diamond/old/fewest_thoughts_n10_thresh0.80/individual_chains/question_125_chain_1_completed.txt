Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, specifically V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². Hmm, I remember that this is the potential for a harmonic oscillator. So, it's like a 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D, with different values and numbers.

First, I think about the energy levels in a 3D harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in the 3D case, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, I think it's a bit different. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 3/2)ℏω, where n is the total quantum number? Wait, no, wait, I think n is actually the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each of these n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ℏω. Wait, no, wait: each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ℏω, so the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ℏω. Oh wait, but n is n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = (n + 3/2) ℏω. But wait, I think another way: sometimes, the energy is written in terms of the total number of quanta. So each direction adds a quantum number, and the principal quantum number is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So yes, E = (n + 3/2) ℏω.

Now, the third excited state. Wait, excited states are counted starting from the ground state. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0, so each excited state is higher. Let me think: the ground state is the first state. The first excited state is the next one, and so on. So the third excited state would be the fourth state in order.

Wait, no, wait. Let's get the numbering right. Ground state is n=0, which is the first state. The first excited state is n=1. The second excited is n=2, and the third excited is n=3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because n can be 0,1,2,3,... So if n=0 is the ground state, then n=1 is the first excited, n=2 is the second, n=3 is the third excited state. So for the third excited state, n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ℏω = (9/2) ℏω. Wait, 3 + 3/2 is 4.5, which is 9/2. So the energy is (9/2) ℏω. Looking at the options, that's option A and option C.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. So, how many eigenfunctions correspond to the same energy level when n=3.

The number of eigenfunctions for a given n in 3D harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of ways the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z can add up to n. Each n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers, so the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n.

For n=3, this is a stars and bars problem. The formula is (n + 3 -1 choose 3-1) = (3 + 2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 possible eigenfunctions for n=3.

So the number is 10, and the energy is (9/2)ℏω. Looking at the options, option A is (9/2)ℏω and 10, which matches.

Wait, but why are the other options there? Let me look at the other options. Option C says (9/2)ℏω and 3, but 3 doesn't match 10, so that's incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass \( m \) moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are given by \( E_n = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. 

1. **Energy of the third excited state**:  
   The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula, the energy is:  
   \[
   E_3 = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
   \]

2. **Number of linearly independent eigenfunctions**:  
   For a given \( n \), the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponds to the number of ways \( n_x + n_y + n_z = n \) can be satisfied, where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. This is a combinatorial problem solved by the stars-and-bars method, and the number of solutions is given by:  
   \[
   \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
   \]  
   For \( n = 3 \), this becomes:  
   \[
   \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
   \]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
