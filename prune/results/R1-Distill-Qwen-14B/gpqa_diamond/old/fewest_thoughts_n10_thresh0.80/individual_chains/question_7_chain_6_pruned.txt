Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hmm, let me think. The question is about determining the energy at which gamma-rays' lifetimes are limited by this process. The reaction given is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. Right, this is a pair production process.

I remember that when high-energy gamma rays interact with the CMB photons, they can produce electron-positron pairs. This interaction depends on the energy of the gamma rays and the density of the CMB photons they're interacting with.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. Wait, but the CMB photons are usually at a very low energy because they're from the afterglow of the Big Bang. The peak is around microwave frequencies, so their energy is indeed very low.

I think this process is related to the photon-photon cross-section. The cross-section for pair production increases with the energy of the gamma ray. But how do I relate this to the lifetime of the gamma-ray photons in the universe?

Oh right, the mean lifetime is determined by the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section, the flux of the CMB photons, and the velocity of the gamma rays (which is the speed of light, since they're photons). 

Wait, the interaction rate Γ is given by Γ ≈ n * σ * v, where n is the number density of the target photons, σ the cross-section, and v the relative velocity.

But wait, for photons, I think the cross-section for pair production peaks when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron mass, which is about 1.02 MeV. So the condition is that the sum of the energies of the two photons (the gamma and the CMB photon) is above this threshold.

So let's see, the gamma has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε = 1e-3 eV. The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E + ε)^2. For pair production, s needs to be at least (2m_e c²)^2, which is (2 * 0.511 MeV)^2 = (1.022 MeV)^2.

But wait, since the CMB photon has such a low energy, ε is negligible compared to E if E is much larger. So s ≈ (E)^2. So E needs to be at least about 1.022 MeV to have this interaction possible. But wait, that's just the threshold. But the problem is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process. So the gamma's lifetime is determined by how quickly they interact, which depends on the interaction rate.

The lifetime τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ. So τ = 1/Γ. But the interaction rate is determined by the cross-section σ, the number density n of CMB photons, and the relative velocity v. Since both are photons moving in the same direction, their relative velocity is c, but wait, for photons moving in opposite directions, their relative velocity is higher. Hmm, but in the universe, the CMB photons are isotropic, so on average, the gamma could be moving in any direction relative to the CMB photons. But I think the standard approach for such calculations is to consider the gamma's rest frame and the CMB photon's frame, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the cross-section and the photon density.

The number density n of CMB photons can be calculated using the formula for the blackbody spectrum. The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The energy density u is given by u = 8π g * (k_B T)^4 / (h^4 c^3), where g is the number of degrees of freedom. For photons, g=2. Wait, but in the CMB, each photon is counted once, but the energy is in terms of frequency. Hmm, maybe it's easier to just recall that the number density n
