Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted aromatic compound. Hmm, di-substituted means there are two substituents on the aromatic ring, right?

So the compound has a six-membered aromatic ring and a total of 8 carbon atoms. Let me think: a benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. But wait, the substituents could be multiple groups. Oh, but wait, it's di-substituted, so two substituent groups on the benzene. Each substituent would contribute some carbons. So, for example, if each substituent is a single group with two carbons, but that might not add up. Alternatively, maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? No, both are substituents, so each must add at least one carbon, right?

Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene has 6, so the substituents account for 2. So each substituent must add one carbon each, but that would be 2 substituents x 1 carbon each = 2, plus the 6 in benzene = 8. So each substituent would be a single carbon group. Hmm. But wait, benzaldehyde has a CHO group, which is two substituents? No, wait, benzaldehyde is a monosubstituted benzene with a CHO group. So maybe in this case, the substituents are CHO and something else.

Wait the question says peaks in the FTIR indicate a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe ester) and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the aromatic ring is 6-membered, di-substituted with two groups: one is a carbonyl-containing group, the other is a halogen.

So substituents could be, for example, a carbonyl group like a ketone (C=O) and a halogen (like Br or Cl). Or maybe a carbonyl as part of an ester or something else.

Wait, but the total number of carbons is 8. So Benzene (6 C) plus substituents. Let's think: if one substituent is a carbonyl, say, a ketone, that would be a C=O attached to the ring. So that's one substituent adding one carbon. The other substituent is a halogen, which is just -X, which doesn't add any carbons. So 6 (ring) +1 (C=O) +0 (X) =7. Not 8. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe one substituent adds two carbons?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group that adds two carbons, like an acetyl group (CH2CO-) or something else. Wait, but wait, let's think: Let's imagine one substituent is a carbonyl group, say, an aldehyde group (CHO) attached to the ring. That's one substituent: CHO is -CHO, which is a substituent with one carbon beyond the ring. The other
