Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get pretty tricky. But I'll try to take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem starts with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the starting material is a norbornene derivative with an ether group.

Then, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, especially with polar aprotic solvents, but under certain conditions, it can lead to elimination or substitution reactions.

The first reaction probably involves some coupling or substitution. 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two bromides on adjacent carbons, each attached to a methyl group. So structure-wise, it's cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br groups at positions 5 and 6.

Wait, when you have two equivalents reacting with the initial compound, maybe it's a di-elimination or a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution is happening. Since the starting material has an ether, maybe it's acting as a base. Or perhaps the sodium iodide is providing iodide ions as nucleophiles.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a ring-opening of the norbornene. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound that can undergo Diels-Alder reactions, but in this case, maybe it's undergoing some other kind of addition. Alternatively, when you have a diene with two bromides, maybe it's a di-elimination to form some kind of di-ene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember that when a dihalide is treated with a base, like NaI, it can undergo elimination, forming a double bond. For example, vicinal dihalides can lose two equivalents of HX to form an alkene. So, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have two CH2Br groups next to each other. So treating with NaI might cause the elimination of Br- and form a double bond between C5 and C6.

Wait, but the starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those positions (5 and 6) has a CH2Br group. So, the structure is cyclohexadiene with substituents at 5 and 6: each is CH2Br. So, when NaI is added, perhaps it's an SN2 reaction, but with two equivalents, maybe each Br leaves, and the adjacent CH2 groups form a double bond.

Wait, but wait: for each CH2Br, if the leaving group leaves, the adjacent CH2 would form a double bond. So each CH2Br could lose Br- and form CH2 groups. Wait, but if you have two adjacent CH2Br groups, losing both Brs would form a conjugated diene? Or perhaps a single double bond between C5 and C6.

Alternatively, maybe each CH2Br is replaced by something else. Wait, but with 2 equivalents of the dihalide and 2 equivalents of NaI, perhaps each Br is replaced by an iodide. But that doesn't seem right because it's a dihalide and only one equivalent of NaI is used per Br.

Wait, perhaps the iodide is acting as a base, abstracting a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination. So, each Br would leave, and the adjacent CH2 groups would form a double bond. So each di-bromomethyl group would form a double bond, but that's maybe not possible because each is on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, turning the two CH2Br groups into a double bond. So the 5 and 6 positions would form a double bond, making the cyclohexene have another double bond. So the starting diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would become cyclohexa-1,3,5-diene? Or maybe 1,3-diene plus another double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is reacting with the norbornene ring. The norbornene has an ether group; maybe the iodide is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the norbornene in some way.

Wait, another thought: the norbornene is an electron-rich diene, perhaps undergoing a Diels-Alder-like reaction with another dienophile. But what's the dienophile here? The dihalide doesn't look like a typical dienophile. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is acting as an electrophile, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing an ene reaction. The ene reaction involves a conjugated diene and an alkyl bromide, where the alkyl group is transferred. Wait! The norbornene is a conjugated diene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene). So, the diene could undergo an ene reaction with the dihalide.

The ene reaction typically involves a diene and an alkyl halide, where the halide is on a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. The mechanism involves the transfer of the alkyl group to the diene, forming a new double bond. So each equivalent of dihalide would add an alkyl group to the norbornene.

Wait, but in this case, the dihalide is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2Br group. Maybe each Br would undergo an elimination when treated with NaI, forming a double bond. Or perhaps the NaI is causing substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. The norbornene is a diene, and the dihalide is the dienophile. But Diels-Alder usually requires a diene and a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups. The dihalide doesn't have strong EWG, but maybe the Br is electron-withdrawing enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a ring-opening metathesis, but I'm not familiar with that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a coupling between the norbornene and the dihalide. The dihalide has two bromide leaving groups, so perhaps a double alkylation occurs, adding two alkyl groups (from the dihalide) onto the norbornene.

But norbornene has two double bonds. Wait, no, the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which means it has two double bonds in the ring? No, wait, noâ€”bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure with two rings. The numbering is such that the double bonds are at 2 and 5. So the structure is norbornene, which has one double bond, but the numbering might imply something else.

Wait, in any case, the starting material is a norbornene derivative. Now, the first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. Let me think about the structure again.

The dihalide is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two substituents at 5 and 6. Each substituent is a CH2Br. So each CH2Br is on adjacent carbons (5 and 6), attached to the cyclohexadiene ring. So the structure is like:

CH2Br - C5 - C6 - CH2Br attached to a cyclohexene ring with double bonds at 1 and 3.

Hmm. When treated with NaI, which is a source of I- ions, perhaps elimination occurs. Each CH2Br would lose Br- and form a double bond. So each CH2Br would lose Br- and a beta-hydrogen to form
