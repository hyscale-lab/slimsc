Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. I'm not super familiar with synchrocyclotrons, but I remember they're a type of cyclotron used to accelerate particles. The question is about finding out how many revolutions a proton makes as it reaches a certain kinetic energy.

Let me read the problem again. The proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, T≈0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0=π/4 and U0=190 kV. The options are A to D with some numbers.

Wait, so the voltage is time-dependent and has a phase Φ0. But I'm not sure how that affects the number of revolutions. Hmm. I remember that in a cyclotron, the particles move in a magnetic field, and the frequency of the applied voltage is related to the particle's motion.

In a cyclotron, the frequency of the oscillator is set to match the circular motion frequency of the particles. The formula I remember is that the particle's angular frequency ω is qB/(m), where q is charge, B is magnetic field, and m is mass. The cyclotron frequency. The voltage is applied in such a way that each time the particle passes through the gap between the D-shapes, it gets a push, thus increasing its kinetic energy.

But wait, this is a synchrocyclotron, which I think is a more advanced version. In a regular cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant, but in a synchrocyclotron, the field increases as the particle's momentum increases. But I'm not sure if that affects this problem directly.

The question is about the number of revolutions. Each time the proton completes a revolution, it gains some energy from the voltage. So the number of revolutions should be related to how many times the voltage can accelerate the proton.

But the voltage given is U(t) = U0 cos(...). The maximum voltage is U0, which is 190 kV. So each time the proton goes through the gap, it can gain up to U0 volts, right? But since the voltage is AC, it might go positive and negative, so maybe each half-cycle provides the energy? Or perhaps it's every full cycle, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the maximum energy gain per revolution would be U0, but maybe the proton isn't at the right phase every time. Because the phase is Φ0=pi/4, which is 45 degrees. So the initial phase is 45 degrees. Does that matter for the number of revolutions? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each time the proton passes through the gap, the voltage is at the right phase to give a kick. So each revolution provides a certain energy gain, so the number of revolutions needed to reach 950 MeV would be the total energy divided by the energy per revolution.

Wait, but wait a second, the energy per revolution isn't just U0. Because the kinetic energy increases as the proton gets faster, so the time taken for each revolution changes. But in a cyclotron, the frequency actually changes because the momentum
