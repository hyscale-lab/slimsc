Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and why certain peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.

Alright, the question says that they did a ChIP-seq on PFA-fixed samples using an antibody for the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After the usual processing, they got some peaks, but when they used PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. So I need to figure out where these disappearing peaks are located.

Wait, what's the difference between PFA fixation and PFA+DSG? I remember that PFA (paraformaldehyde) is a common fixative that crosslinks proteins to DNA. DSG is another crosslinker, which is a diamine, I think. DSG is more efficient at crosslinking proteins to each other but maybe less so for DNA-protein crosslinking. Or wait, maybe DSG is used to stabilize interactions that are more labile. Oh right, DSG is a longer crosslinkerâ€”like, it can crosslink proteins that are a bit farther apart, which might help in capturing interactions that are transient or require more extensive crosslinking.

So, in standard PFA fixation, it crosslinks DNA and proteins. If you add DSG, perhaps it's for more efficient crosslinking, maybe to stabilize interactions that wouldn't otherwise be captured. But why would peaks disappear when using this combination?

The peaks represent regions where the transcription factor (IKAROS) binds. If the peaks are gone when using PFA+DSG, that suggests that the binding sites detected in the initial experiment weren't real. Or perhaps they were artifacts of the fixation method.

Wait, another thought: some DNA regions are more prone to shearing. If the DNA isn't sheared properly, maybe certain regions aren't amplified as much. But the question is about the disappearance of peaks when using a different fixation. So maybe the initial method (PFA only) fixes certain regions better, but the double fixation somehow disrupts that.

Alternatively, perhaps the antibody isn't binding correctly. But the question states that the antibody is specific, so maybe that's not the issue.

I remember that during fixation, certain regions of the genome are more susceptible to shearing. For example, open chromatin regions like promoters and enhancers are more accessible, so they might shear more easily. Maybe the initial PFA fixation didn't shear enough, and with DSG, it leads to more efficient shearing, but that's not directly causing the disappearance.

Wait, maybe some regions are fixed more efficiently with PFA alone, and when DSG is added, it somehow disrupts the binding. Or perhaps the DSG treatment causes some regions not to be effectively crosslinked, leading the peaks to be missed.

Alternatively, could it be that regions that are more prone to form aggregates or secondary structures are not captured as well with PFA+DSG? Like repetitive regions might be harder to process.

Wait, the question says that when PFA+DSG was used, the peaks disappeared. So in the first case (PFA only), the peaks were found, but with PFA+DSG, they aren't. So perhaps the initial method was fixing some regions that are actually not binding sites but are being pulled down due to some artifact.

Oh! I think I remember something about shearing. If the DNA isn't sheared enough, you might get more background noise because longer fragments are harder to map accurately. Maybe in PFA fixation without DSG, the DNA isn't sheared as much, so the regions that are more prone to crosslinking (like when using an antibody that's maybe not specific) would appear as peaks. But with DSG, the shearing is more efficient, so those non-specific regions are no longer detected.

Wait, but that doesn't explain why the peaks would disappear. Let me think again. Another angle:
