Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to parse what's being asked.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. Since the state is given as proportional, I probably need to normalize it first because the coefficients given might not sum to 1 in their squared magnitudes.

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds familiar. So if the matrix is 2x2, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. That matrix looks like a spin operator in the x or y direction, but wait, no, the Pauli matrices have specific forms. Oh wait, wait. Let me think: The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. But the given matrix A has zero diagonals and A12 = A21 = hbar/2. So it's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal, zeros on diagonal. So A = (hbar/2) * σ_x. So the operator is (hbar/2) times σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So the operator's eigenstates are these |+x> and |-x> states. So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. What's the eigenvalues of A? Well, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A would have eigenvalues (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so ±hbar/2.

But wait, the question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. So the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, but the operator A's eigenstates are in the x-basis. So I'll need to find the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, and then the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients' magnitudes.

So the plan is:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>.
2. Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (i.e., |+x> and |-x>).
3. Compute the probabilities of each eigenstate, which are the squares of the amplitudes.
4. Then, compute the average (expected) value of the operator A.

Wait, but another approach: the average value of operator A can be found using <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>. Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and σ_x has expectation values related to the state's expectation in the
