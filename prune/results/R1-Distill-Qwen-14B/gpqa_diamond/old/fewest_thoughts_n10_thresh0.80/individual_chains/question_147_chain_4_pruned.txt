Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that protons and antiprotons are annihilating to produce two A+ and two A- particles. So the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. The antiproton is moving slowly, right? And the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, each a different fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Oh, but wait, the antiproton is the one moving slowly. The proton is probably at rest, or maybe they're considering the lab frame where the proton is stationary and the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, I think the setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity, so that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy.

Wait, but when they annihilate, they produce these particles A. So I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum here.

Let me think about the initial and final states.

Initial state:
- Proton (p) is at rest, so its energy is m_p c².
- Antiproton (p̄) is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately m_p c² (since its velocity is small, kinetic energy is small, so total energy is m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² ≈ m_p c² when v is small compared to c).

But wait, wait. The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe its total energy is close to its rest mass energy. Let me write down the initial total energy and momentum.

Initial energy: E_initial = E_p + E_p̄
Since the proton is at rest, E_p = m_p c².
The antiproton's energy is E_p̄ = γ m_p c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. But since it's moving slowly, γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), which is approximately 1. So E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v
