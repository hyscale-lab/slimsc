Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, right? So I'm trying to think about each option and whether they need regularization.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. Let's break down each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory that attempts to unify all the fundamental forces, including gravity. String theories, including superstring theory, are usually considered to be background-dependent, and they propose that particles are not point-like but rather tiny strings. I remember reading that string theories might not have the same kind of divergences as in other quantum field theories because they're higher-dimensional or perhaps because they're a different approach. But wait, do they still require regularization? Or are they free from it? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Maybe string theories don't require it because their perturbative expansions are different, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and that it's asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. But wait, quantum field theories in general require regularization when dealing with loop integrals because they produce divergences. So QCD would require regularization techniques when performing calculations, especially in perturbative expansions. Like using things like dimensional regularization or cutoff methods. So this theory does need regularization. So option B is out because the question is looking for one that doesn't require it.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. I know QED is a well-tested theory and that it's a renormalizable theory. But renormalization is a process that deals with handling divergences, right? And renormalization often involves regularization as a step. So yes, QED requires regularization when you're doing loop calculations because you get infinities. So option C isn't the answer either.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version, dealing with Maxwell's equations and such. Classical theories don't involve the same
