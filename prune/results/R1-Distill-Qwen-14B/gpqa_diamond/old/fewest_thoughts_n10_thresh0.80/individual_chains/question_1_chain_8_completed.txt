Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty relation. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for this purpose, it's the order of magnitude that matters.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if I have a certain uncertainty in time, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional. But in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes would relate to the uncertainty in time, right? Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state, and the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, so the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states might appear the same due to the uncertainty.

So each state has its own lifetime. Which one do I use? The lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Hmm, the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) would have a larger energy uncertainty because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 would be about ħ/(1e-9). For E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is about ħ/(1e-8). But wait, since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state's energy is uncertain within a range. For E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. To clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, the uncertainties could overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart. But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the more precise measurement. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states are definitely separated beyond the possible error margins.

Wait, let's compute the uncertainties. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 Joule-seconds. Let me convert that into eV-seconds because the options are in eV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 Joules. So, 1 eV·s is 1.60218e-19 J·s. So, ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. Wait, yes, because 1.05457e-34 J·s divided by 1.60218e-19 J/eV gives approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, for E1, Δt is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / (2Δt) approximately. Wait, but sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt, but the exact factor (like 1, 2, or π) varies depending on the source. But for this problem, the exact factor might not matter because the options are several orders of magnitude apart, so the exact coefficient isn't as important as the order of magnitude.

So let's compute ΔE for each Δt.

For E1: Δt = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV, which is about 6.6e-7 eV.

For E2: Δt = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV, which is about 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, that's the uncertainty for each state. So for the two states, the maximum uncertainty in their energy measurements would be the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum possible is the maximum of the two. Because the state with the longer lifetime (E2) has a smaller uncertainty. So the overall uncertainty in their energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, actually, when considering the energy difference between two states, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because the energy difference ΔE_total = |E2 - E1| must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) for them to be distinguishable.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if E2 is measured as E2 ± ΔE2, and E1 is E1 ± ΔE1, then the difference could be as low as (E2 - ΔE2) - (E1 + ΔE1) = (E2 - E1) - (ΔE1 + ΔE2). So to have E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Otherwise, the difference could be within the uncertainties, making them indistinguishable.

So let's compute the sum of the uncertainties.

ΔE1 is approximately 6.6e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.6e-8 eV. Adding them gives 6.6e-7 + 0.66e-7 = 7.26e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7.26e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is much smaller than 7e-7, so no.

Option B: 1e-11 → also way too small.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 7.26e-7. So yes, it's much larger, so it's distinguishable.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is about 0.014 times 7.26e-7. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 7.26e-7 is ~7.26e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 7.26e-7, meaning the energy difference would be smaller than the sum of the uncertainties. So D is too small to be distinguishable.

So the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the required 7e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

E1: Δt = 1e-9 s → ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

E2: Δt = 1e-8 s → ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Sum is 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 6.582e-7 + 0.6582e-7 = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the required ΔE must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV. Let's look at the options.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. 1e-4 eV is 1e4 times larger than 7.24e-7 eV (since 1e-4 is 1e4 * 1e-8, but wait, 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 1e-8, but 7.24e-7 is 724e-9, so 1e-4 is 100 times larger than that. Because 1e-4 is 1e-4, 7.24e-7 is 0.000724e-3. 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is smaller than 0.000724? No, wait, 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 7.24e-7.

Wait so 1e-4 eV is definitely larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference of 1e-4 eV is way more than the required 7e-7, so it's distinguishable.

Looking at the options again: only option C is larger than the required 7e-7 eV. The others are smaller.

So the correct answer should be option C, 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (related to the lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For distinguishability, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy uncertainties
The reduced Planck's constant is \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The lifetimes of the states are given as \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \Delta t \), we calculate:

- For \( E_1 \):  
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For \( E_2 \):  
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Sum of uncertainties
The total uncertainty in the energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To distinguish the two states, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \).

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not sufficient.  
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not sufficient.  
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.  
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not sufficient.

### Final Answer
The energy difference must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), and the only option that satisfies this is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

**Answer: C**
