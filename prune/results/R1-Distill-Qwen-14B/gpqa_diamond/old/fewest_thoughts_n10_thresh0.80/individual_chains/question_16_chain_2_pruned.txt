Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? And that usually happens when there's a chiral center present. But wait, there are exceptions too, like in some cases with meso compounds or if there's a plane of symmetry.

Let's look at each compound one by one. So there are seven compounds listed, and I need to determine how many are optically active. The options are A to D, with answers varying from 2 to 5. 

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, Z means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But does that create a chiral center? The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait no, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1 has Cl, a double bond (so two substituents), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but here it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl and a CH2 group). Hmm. So wait, C1 is Cl, double bond, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on the first carbon. The structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH3? Wait, no, but 2-methyl but-1-ene is CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on the first carbon would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a
