Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, let's see. So, the question is about an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that's heated. The reaction produces a mixture of gases. These gases pass through some tubes, and we have some weight changes and gas volume left. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the setup. They heated a 7.20 g mixture of A and B to 200Â°C without air. So, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. The products are gases, which pass through three tubes.

The first tube has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Wait, I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 can act as a dehydrating agent but also can react with water or acids. Oh, right, if the gas has water vapor, it would get captured here. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, it would absorb water, increasing the tube's weight. The weight increased by 3.60 g, so that must be the water lost from the salts during heating.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is CO2, it would react with the solution. But the weight didn't change, so either there's no CO2 or something else happened. Wait, maybe the gas that passed through didn't react with Ca(OH)2, or maybe another reaction? Let me think. Oh, maybe if the gas was CO2, it would dissolve, but if it's something else, like H2 or NH3, it wouldn't react. But since the weight didn't change, perhaps no CO2? Or maybe it didn't reach that part? Hmm.

The third tube is red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. So, when a gas reacts with hot copper, it could be something like H2 or CO. Let me think: CO would react with CuO in some conditions, but wait, when the gas passes through hot copper, maybe it's oxidizing. Wait, or maybe the gas is H2. Because H2 can react with CuO upon heating, producing water and Cu. Wait, no, H2 would reduce CuO to Cu and produce water. But in this case, the copper is getting oxidized, so the
