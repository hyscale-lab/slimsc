Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this. The question is about the substitution of substances 1 to 6 with bromine in excess, and we need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Wait, wait. Electrophilic substitution on aromatic compounds. Right, the structure of the substituent will direct the incoming electrophile. So activating and deactivating groups play a role here. Oh, and the positions they direct to—ortho, meta, or para.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for each compound, when they undergo bromination, what's the proportion of the para product? The one with the highest para fraction would be the one where the substituent strongly directs incoming bromine to the para position.

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -OH) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, -Cl) are meta directors. Wait, but wait, some deactivating groups are meta directors, others are para? Or no, I think deactivating groups are either meta or para depending on their nature.

Let me list each substituent:

1) С6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons through the inductive effect. So it's an activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine substitutes, the bromine will add to the ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the methyl group. Wait, but the methyl is an activating group, so the incoming electrophile (Br+) will be directed to ortho and para positions more than meta. So for this compound, the major products would be para and ortho. But since the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction, how much is it compared to the others.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzoyloxyethyl group, I think. Wait, the substituent is O-CO-C2H5. Wait, no, the structure is benzene with a COOEt group. So the substituent is -OOCR, where R is ethyl. Wait, no, the group is -COOEt, so it's a carbonyloxyethyl group. Oh wait, the substituent is an ester group: -COOCH2CH3. So the substituent is an ester, which is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Ester groups are meta directors. So the incoming Br would go to the meta positions. So the para product would be minor. So the para fraction is low here.

3) C6H5-Cl: The substituent is Cl. Chlorine is a halogen. Wait, halogens are a bit tricky. They are deactivating because they have higher electronegativity, but they are also ortho/para directors. Because the Cl has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, although the inductive effect is deactivating. So Cl is a deactiv
