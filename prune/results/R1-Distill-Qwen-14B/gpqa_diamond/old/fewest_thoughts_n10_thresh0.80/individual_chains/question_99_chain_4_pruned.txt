Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a similar chain but varying substituents and a COOH group at the end.

First, the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Oh wait, the peak is very broad, which I think is typical for a carboxylic acid because the O-H in those is quite acidic and can form hydrogen bonds, leading to a broader and stronger peak. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have strong absorption around 1700, maybe a bit higher if it's another carbonyl group, but in this case, the options all have a COOH group, so that makes sense.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR. None of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, there's no double bonds in the molecule, or at least no protons attached to them. Looking at the options, all structures have a straight chain, so no double bonds. That's a relief; I don't have to worry about splitting from adjacent double bond protons.

The NMR has several signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, those are complicated splitting patterns. Let me think about how that arises. Splitting in NMR is due to neighboring protons. Each splitting is a result of coupling with adjacent CH groups.

So, the splitting pattern tells me about the structure around each proton. For example, a quartet (like in the first signal) comes from coupling with three neighboring protons, maybe a CH2 group. Wait, no, a quartet is splitting into four peaks, which happens when a proton is next to a CH with 3 protons. Wait, no, quartet arises when a proton is split by a neighboring group with three equivalent protons. Because each neighboring H would cause splitting, so n+1, where n is the number of neighboring H. So if a proton is next to a CH2 group, that's two H, so a triplet. Next to a CH group, one H, so a doublet.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think again. If a proton is adjacent to another group with n protons, it will split into n+1 peaks. So, for example, a proton next to a CH2 (two H) would split into triplet.

But in this problem, the splitting is more complex, like doublet of triplets, etc. So that indicates each proton is coupling with multiple sets of neighboring protons.

Let's take the first signal: a doublet of triplets of quartets. That sounds like each proton is being split by multiple adjacent groups. Let me parse that. A doublet (from one neighbor), then each of those splits into triplets (another neighbor), and then each of those splits into quartets (another neighbor again). So perhaps each proton is next to three different sets of neighboring protons, each set having 1, 2, and 3 H? Or maybe it's more about the structure.

Wait another approach: maybe the molecule has a branching point, like a carbon connected to multiple CH groups. For example, a central carbon connected to different groups, each with their own protons.

Looking at the options, the structures are:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like: CH2CH2(C(C2H5)(H))... Wait, no. Let me write it out.

Wait, it's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the central part is two CH groups, each attached to CH3 and C2H5 groups. So each of these CHs would have neighboring groups.

Alternatively, one of the options might have a structure where a carbon is attached to two other carbons, each with their own substituents.

Looking at the options, option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is: CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central two CH groups each have a CH3 and are attached to a CH2CH3 and COOH.

In this case, each CH would have neighboring groups. For example, the CH in the middle is connected to a CH2CH3 (so maybe that's a longer chain), and the other CH is connected to two CH3 groups. So when looking at the NMR, the protons on these CHs would have complex splitting.

Wait, let's think about each option's structure and how that would affect the NMR.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the structure is:

- CH3 attached to a C which is connected to another C (which also has a C2H5). So each of those CH groups is attached to a CH3 and C2H5. So each of the two CH groups would be adjacent to each other, perhaps leading to coupling. Wait, or maybe each CH is attached to other groups.

Wait, perhaps it's a geminal di-substituted structure. Let's imagine:

The molecule is something like:

CH2CH2... No, perhaps a more correct way is to
