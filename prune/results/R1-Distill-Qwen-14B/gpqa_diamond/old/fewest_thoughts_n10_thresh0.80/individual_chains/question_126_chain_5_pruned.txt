Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow since I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and chromatography concepts.

Okay, the question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, and then analyzing their products using HPLC. The goal is to find out how many peaks appear in the chiral and normal-phase HPLC chromatograms after combining the products.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones. So, hexan-3-one has a carbonyl group at position 3. When LAH reduces a ketone, it typically turns it into a secondary alcohol. So the product here should be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, the starting material is an enol ether? No, wait, 5-methoxy means there's a methoxy group on carbon 5. So the structure is:

CH3CH2C(O)OCH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3. But 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but wait the positions might be a bit different. Let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3. The 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon. Wait, let me count. Carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So the carbonyl is at C3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2(CO)CH2-OCH3, but wait, the chain would be longer. Let me draw it out:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CO

4: CH2-

5: OCH3?

Wait, no, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is at 3, and the methoxy is on 5. So:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OMe (OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but that's only five carbons. Oh wait, wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons. So positions are 1 to 6.

So structure:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-OCH3

6: CH3?

Wait, no, maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH2CH3? No, wait, because 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon. Let's try to count from the carbonyl.

3: C=O

Then 4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)

Wait, no, that would make it pentan
