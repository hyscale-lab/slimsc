Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through this carefully.

The question is about identifying the starting materials A and B that, when treated with different reducing agents, give specific products. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reducing agents used are LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent compared to BH3. But wait, BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are different from reductions. Oh, wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. LiBH4 is used for reducing carbonyl groups, like ketones and aldehydes, to alcohols. But BH3 is often used in hydroboration-oxidation, which adds boron to double bonds. Wait, but in the question, both reactions are treating the compounds with reducing agents. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps both reactions are reductions. Or maybe one is a reduction and the other is a hydroboration.

Wait, the products are ketones. Wait, no, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. Wait, but in the reaction, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R) product, and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S) product.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 is a reducing agent. If the product is a ketone, then perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl that's being reduced. Wait, but LiBH4 usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Unless the starting material is a ketone that is somehow not reacting, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the product is a result of a different reaction, like a pinacol rearrangement or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides or something else. Alternatively, maybe the products are formed via a different mechanism. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone. So, how would you get a cyclic ketone from a starting material upon reduction?
