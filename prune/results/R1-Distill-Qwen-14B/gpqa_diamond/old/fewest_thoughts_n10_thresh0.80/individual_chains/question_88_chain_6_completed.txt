Okay, so I've got this question about immunology and rotavirus. Hmm, I remember that rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? And the question involves some experiments with GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins. Let me try to unpack this.

So the setup: They tag the inner capsid proteins with GFP and give them to mice orally. Then they use in vivo imaging. They saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid, which makes sense because the stomach has a lot of acid, which could break down proteins, including GFP maybe? Or maybe the proteins are digested. But some made it through the stomach acid and into the intestines, but got entangled in the mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Wait, secondary lymphoid organs include places like the Peyer's patches, which are in the intestinal wall. So the GFP-labeled proteins probably didn't get that far, but some did.

Then they identify the fluorescent Peyer patches. Oh wait, Peyer's patches are these areas in the small intestine where a lot of immune activity happens. So the GFP probably got taken up by immune cells there. Then they isolate the proliferating cell population. So these are likely B cells that are dividing, maybe activated by the antigen.

They sequence the variable heavy chain genes and see high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that something has changed in the B cells. I remember that during an immune response, B cells undergo several processes that change their antibodies. Let me think about the options.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to form the heavy chain. This happens during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow, so it's a primary diversification. But here, the B cells have already been activated and are proliferating, so maybe this isn't the process happening now.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. But the question is about the variability in the variable regions, which is more about the adaptive response.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which happens after the primary immune response. This involves recombination at the heavy chain locus but doesn't change the variable regions, just the constant region. So the variable heavy chain genes wouldn't have high variability due to class switching.

Somatic hypermutation is the process where B cells, after antigenic stimulation, undergo mutation in the variable regions of their heavy and light chains. This increases the diversity of antibodies, allowing for a more specific response. It's a key part of the immune response that happens after the initial activation, when B cells are dividing in places like the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues.

So in this case, the GFP-tagged proteins were delivered, some got to the Peyer's patches, and the B cells there are proliferating. Their variable regions are showing high variability, which points to somatic hypermutation. That's the process that increases the diversity of antibodies by introducing mutations in the variable regions.

Wait, but waitâ€”does this happen in Peyer's patches? I think Peyer's patches are a type of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue and are sites where B cells can be activated. The process of somatic hypermutation occurs in the germinal centers, which are part of lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid organs, including Peyer's patches perhaps. So when the B cells are proliferating, they might be undergoing hypermutation to increase their affinity for the antigen.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other GFP-tagged proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability, suggesting a process that alters the variable regions of antibodies.

To analyze the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, introducing mutations in the variable regions of heavy and light chains to increase antibody diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes and aligns with the context of proliferating B cells in Peyer's patches.

- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not involve changes to the variable regions of antibodies. It is unrelated to the observed variability.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) by recombination at the heavy chain locus. However, it does not alter the variable regions, making it inconsistent with the observed high variability in variable heavy chains.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the heavy chain. It is a primary diversification event but does not occur in mature B cells during an immune response, making it irrelevant to the scenario.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, a process that occurs in activated B cells during the immune response to increase antibody diversity. This aligns with the observed fluorescence in Peyer's patches and the proliferation of B cells.

Answer: A
