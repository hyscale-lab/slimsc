Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. 

Wait, what does the geometrical position mean here? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere. For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, like |φ><φ|, and it corresponds to a vector on the Bloch sphere. But this ρ isn't a pure state; it's a mixed state because it's a convex combination of |0> and |1>.

So the density matrix for a mixed state can be written as a statistical mixture. In this case, it's (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by ½. That means the state is a 50% mixture of |0> and |50% mixture of |1>, so it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

In the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is represented by the maximally mixed state, which is the maximally spread-out state. Wait, no, actually, the maximally mixed state is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. Because for a single qubit, the identity matrix is 2x2, so I/2 would be diag(½, ½). Wait, wait, no, wait, the identity matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[½, 0],[0, ½]]. So the density matrix given here is exactly that, because each |i><i| is the outer product, and when you add |0><0| and |1><1|, you get the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by <x, y, z> where ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. So if ρ is I/2, then all the terms x, y, z must be zero because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. Therefore, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a mixed state can be expressed in terms of its Bloch vector \((x, y, z)\), where the density matrix is related to the Pauli matrices as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{x \sigma_x + y \sigma_y + z \sigma_z}{2}.
\]

For the given \(\rho\), it is equivalent to \(\frac{I}{2}\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. Comparing this to the general form, it is clear that \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position in the qubits space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this represents the origin in the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
