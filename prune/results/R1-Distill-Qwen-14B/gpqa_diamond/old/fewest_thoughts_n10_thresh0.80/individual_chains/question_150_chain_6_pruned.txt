Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

First, the question provides the molecular formula of the compound: C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a couple of rings and double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) plus maybe an enal or something with a double bond and a ring, plus possibly an amide or something else.

The NMR data is given as:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each signal. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet if not split by adjacent protons. Hmm, but if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group, maybe it's a triplet. So like R-CH2-CHO. But wait, the triplet would mean two neighboring protons. So the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe an enol tautomer? Not sure yet.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each with 2H. That suggests two para-substituted aromatic rings. Because in a para-substituted benzene, each proton is a doublet. So maybe two phenyl groups attached. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If there are two benzene rings (each C6H5), that would account for 12 carbons, but our formula is C8. So that can't be. Wait, maybe each substituent is on the same benzene ring. Wait, wait, perhaps the compound is a diaryl ketone or something similar. Or perhaps one of the rings is substituted with another group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: C8. If it's two benzene rings, that's 12 C, but that's too much. So perhaps only one benzene ring. Let me see: benzene is 6 C. Then the rest is 2 C from the substituent. Plus another group with a nitro or something? Wait, the formula has 8 C in total. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let's see: The 9.72 ppm is probably the aldehyde proton. So maybe the compound is a benzaldehyde with substituents.

So, the aromatic signals: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) could be from a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the coupling would give two doublets. So if one substituent is an aldehyde group, and another is something else. Wait, but the aldehyde is at the ortho position maybe?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzyl group attached to another structure. Let me try to sketch this.

Wait, the NMR also shows a 3.66 ppm doublet (2H). That might be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe a CH2-O or CH2-N. But considering that after the reaction steps, perhaps it's a CH2 attached to something like a carbonyl.

The reagents used are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: That's a nitrous acid condition, usually used for diazotization of aromatic amines, especially under cold conditions (like 0-5Â°C). It converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt.

2. H2O: Diazonium salt hydrolysis. If the diazonium is treated with water, especially under acidic conditions, it can undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol.

3. aq. KOH and heat: That's a typical condition for elimination reactions, like the formation of a carbonyl group from a glycol via oxidation, or perhaps an E
