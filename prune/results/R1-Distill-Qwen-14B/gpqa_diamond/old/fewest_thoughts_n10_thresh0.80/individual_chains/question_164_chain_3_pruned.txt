Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to work through it. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. And they've got radial velocity (RV) variations as well. The main goal is to find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the period of the orbit is related to the masses of the stars through Kepler's laws. The formula for the orbital period is linked to the sum of the masses. Oh right, Kepler's third law, which in the binary case is expressed as P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³, where a is the separation between the stars. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula here.

Alternatively, I remember that the radial velocities of the stars are related to their masses. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity, since the center of mass is closer to it. So the velocity amplitude of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the system's center of mass is where the two stars orbit around. So if one star is more massive, it's moving more slowly.

Wait, so if in system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Let's call them V1 and V2. Then, the mass of each star would be inversely proportional to their velocities. So M1 is proportional to V2, and M2 is proportional to V1. Because M1 * V1 = M2 * V2. So the more massive star has a lower velocity.

So for system_1, M1/M2 = V2/V1. So V1 is 10, V2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2. Then the total mass of system_1 would be M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2. Wait no, wait. Because each star's mass is inversely proportional to their velocity. So if M1 is proportional to V2 and M2 is proportional to V1, then
