Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark spots called interference maxima and minima. The shape of the aperture affects the diffraction pattern. For example, a circular aperture produces the famous Airy disk with a central bright spot and surrounding rings.

But wait, the question is about a polygon with a very large number of sides, N approaching infinity. Oh right, when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. So maybe the problem simplifies to the circular aperture case. But wait, no, the options don't all look circular. Wait, the first thing I should consider is what the aperture looks like. All apothems are the same length a. An apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side in a regular polygon. So if N is large, the apothem a would be related to the radius of the circle.

Wait, if N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a would be the radius of the circle. So the problem reduces to a circular aperture. Then, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture would apply here.

But then, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but wait, in the far field, the diffraction pattern for a circle has a central maximum and then minima at specific angles. I think the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ equals approximately 1.22 λ/(π a)? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up some formulas.

Wait, recall the formula for the minima in single-slit diffraction. For a single slit of width d, the minima occur at θ where sinθ = mλ/d, with m = 1,2,3... So for the first minimum, θ = λ/(d). But wait, that's for a single slit, which is different from an aperture. But for a circular aperture, the minima are
