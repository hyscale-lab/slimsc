Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, black hole entropy, I think. Alright, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which relates to their area. Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula! The entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon divided by the Planck area.

The question gives me some data: the distance to the galaxy is 10^10 parsecs, and the angular size of the event horizon is 10^-17 degrees. I need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy.

First, let me jot down what I know. The formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Wait, I should get the exact formula right. Oh, right, the formula is S = (A/(4 l_p^2)) * (1/(k_B)), where l_p is the Planck length. Wait, no, correction. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) multiplied by some constants. Let me see, the standard formula is S = (A/(4 l_p^2)) * (k_B), or is it S = (A/(4 l_p^2)) * (1/(k_B))? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: the area A is in m², Planck length l_p is in meters. So area A in terms of Planck units would be A/(l_p^2). Each unit of Planck area is (l_p)^2, so the number of Planck areas is A/(l_p^2). So the entropy is S = (A/(4 l_p^2)) * (k_B) ? Or is it (A/(4 l_p^2)) * something else?

Wait, the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Let me make sure. Another approach: the entropy S is proportional to the area A of the event horizon. The area of the event horizon for a Schwarzschild black hole is A = 8π (2GM/c²)^2. So A = 32 π (G M)^2/(c^4). Then, substituting into the entropy formula, S becomes (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) = (32 π G² M² / c^4) * c^3 / (4 ħ G k_B) ) = (32 π G M² c^3) / (4 c^4 ħ G k_B) ) → simplifying, S = (8 π G M²) / (c ħ k_B). Hmm, not sure if that's the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the radius of the event horizon (the Schwarzschild radius), then calculate the area, then plug into the entropy formula.

Yes, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by R_s = 2 G M / c². So the area A is 4 π R_s² =
