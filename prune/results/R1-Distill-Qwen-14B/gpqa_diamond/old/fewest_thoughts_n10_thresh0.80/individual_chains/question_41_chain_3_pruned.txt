Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But wait, this glass is moving relative to the observer. So how does that affect the speed?

The setup is that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer. So the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass is moving. But wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, so the light is moving towards the observer too. Or does the direction matter here?

Wait, no, the beam is in the same direction as the glass's movement, but the glass is moving towards the observer. So the beam is going towards the observer, same direction as the glass's velocity. Wait, no, if the glass is moving toward the observer, then the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the glass's velocity is, say, to the left towards the observer, and the light is moving to the left too. Or perhaps I should set up a coordinate system. Let me imagine the lab frame where the observer is stationary. The glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, so let's say the glass is moving in the negative x-direction. The light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion
