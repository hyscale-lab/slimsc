Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target, and they've given some phase shifts. I remember that phase shifts are related to scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics, particularly in partial wave analysis. 

Hmm, the problem states that the measured phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. They also mention to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess higher-order terms beyond l=4 are zero or can be neglected. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, the scattering amplitude... I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula I recall is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cos θ), where k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which would be θ=0°, right? Because the beam is along the direction of motion.

So along θ=0°, cosθ is 1, and the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are known. Let me think about what P_l(1) is. Oh right, P_l(1) equals 1 for any l because P_l(1) = 1 when you plug in x=1. So each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * 1. 

So the scattering amplitude f can be written as (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. But wait, the imaginary part of f would be the imaginary component of this sum. The amplitude f is complex, and the imaginary part would come from the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

Breaking it down, each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ. Let's think about e^{i δ} sin δ. Wait, e^{i δ} is cos δ + i sin δ. So when I multiply e^{i δ} with sin δ, I get sin δ (cos δ + i sin δ). 

Wait, no, actually wait a second. The term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. So expanding e^{i δ}, each term becomes (2l+1) (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) sin δ_l. That would be (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l. Because when you distribute, the i is multiplied by sin² δ. So summing over all l, the imaginary part of f would be (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but what is k? The wave number k is given by (sqrt(2m
