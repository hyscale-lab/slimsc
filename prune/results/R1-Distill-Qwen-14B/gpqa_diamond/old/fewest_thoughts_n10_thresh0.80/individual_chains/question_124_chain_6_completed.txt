Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction. Since the particles are moving at high speeds, their lifetime as seen from the lab frame (the detector's frame) is longer than their proper lifetime. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame.

So the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma times tau. The particles will travel a certain distance before decaying. The distance they travel is speed multiplied by time. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, we can approximate their speed as the speed of light, c. So the distance they travel is approximately c * gamma tau.

Wait, but wait. The speed isn't exactly c, but for gamma around 20, beta (v/c) is close to 1. So for beta = v/c ≈1, the distance L would be beta c gamma tau. But since beta is close to 1, we can just say L ≈ c gamma tau.

So the particles that reach the detector's walls must travel a distance equal to the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. So 30 meters = c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but in the original scenario, with gamma=20, only one third of the particles reach the walls. Oh, wait, no, no. Wait, no, the question says that at gamma ~20, one third reach the walls on average. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. The number of particles that reach the detector walls depends on how long they survive before decaying. If they survive longer, they have a higher chance of reaching the wall. So the fraction that reach the wall depends on the gamma factor.

Wait, perhaps if the lifetime is longer (higher gamma), more particles would reach the detector walls. Because they have more time to travel the distance before decaying.

So when gamma is higher, more particles make it to the wall. That makes sense.

Given that, at gamma=20, one third reach the wall. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds reach the wall.

So the key is to find the gamma such that the number of particles that reach the wall is 2/3 instead of 1/3.

But how does the fraction depend on gamma?

Wait, I think I need to model the survival probability. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The average lifetime is longer, so the particles have a higher chance to travel further.

The probability that a particle decays before traveling a distance L is given by 1 - exp(-L/(c gamma tau)), because the decay process is exponential.

Wait, yes. The decay follows an exponential law. The proper decay rate is 1/tau, so in the lab frame, it's 1/(gamma tau). The probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). Since the particle is moving at speed v, the time taken to reach the wall is t = L/(v). So substituting, the probability is 1 - exp(- L/(v gamma tau)).

But for ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately c, so v ≈ c. Then t ≈ L/(c), and the probability becomes 1 - exp(- L/(c gamma tau)).

So the fraction that decay before reaching the wall is 1 - exp(-L/(c gamma tau)). Therefore, the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-L/(c gamma tau)).

Wait, no. Wait, if the probability of decaying before reaching the wall is 1 - exp(-L/(c gamma tau)), then the probability of surviving (reaching the wall) is exp(- L/(c gamma tau)).

In the initial case, with gamma=20, the fraction reaching the wall is one third, so 1/3 = exp(- L/(c * 20 * tau)).

We can write this as equation (1): 1/3 = exp(-30/(c * 20 tau)).

Wait, because L is 30 meters, so L=30 m. So substituting L=30 m, equation (1) becomes 1/3 = exp( -30/(c * 20 tau) ) → 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) → 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).

Wait, no. Let me compute. Let me take natural log on both sides.

ln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 tau) → ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau) → 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).

But 30/(20 c tau) = 3/(2 c tau) → 3/(2 c tau) = ln(3).

So, 1/(c tau) = (2 ln(3))/(3) → 1/(c tau) = (2 * 1.0986)/3 ≈ (2.1972)/3 ≈ 0.7324.

Wait, let me compute ln(3): yes, it's approximately 1.0986.

So 1/(c tau) ≈ 0.7324 → c tau ≈ 1/0.7324 ≈ 1.365 meters.

Wait, perhaps I don't need to compute it numerically. Let's keep it symbolic for now.

Now, for the desired scenario, we want the fraction reaching the wall to be two-thirds, so 2/3 = exp(-30/(c gamma tau)).

Take natural log: ln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma tau) → ln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma tau).

Multiply both sides by -1: ln(3/2) = 30/(c gamma tau).

But from equation (1), we know that 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3). So 30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3).

We can substitute 30/(c tau) into the second equation.

So the equation becomes:

30/(c gamma tau) = ln(3/2) → 30/(c tau) * 1/(gamma) = ln(3/2).

But 30/(c tau) is 20 ln(3), as from equation (1).

So substituting:

(20 ln 3) / gamma = ln(3/2).

Solve for gamma:

gamma = (20 ln 3) / ln(3/2).

Compute the value of this.

First, compute ln(3) ≈1.0986, ln(3/2)=ln(1.5)≈0.4055.

So gamma ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ (21.972) / 0.4055 ≈ let's compute that.

21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ approximately 54.17.

Hmm, so gamma is approximately 54, which would correspond to option A)54.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, in the initial condition: gamma=20, fraction is 1/3. The desired condition is 2/3. Wait, but wait—wait, the fraction reaching the wall is exp(-30/(c gamma tau)).

In the first case, with gamma=20, 1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)) → ln(3) ≈ 30/(20 c tau) → 30/(20 c tau)=ln(3) → c tau = 30/(20 ln(3)) ≈ 30/(20 * 1.0986) ≈ 30/(21.972) ≈ 1.365 m.

In the second case, we want 2/3 = exp(-30/(gamma c tau)) → ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau).

So 30/(gamma c tau) = ln(3/2) → 30/(gamma c tau) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

But from the first case, c tau is 30/(20 ln(3)) → 30/(20*1.0986) ≈ 1.365 m.

So plugging c tau ≈ 1.365 into the second equation: 30/(gamma * 1.365) = 0.4055.

Solving for gamma:

gamma = 30 / (1.365 * 0.4055) ≈ 30 / (0.553) ≈ 54.25.

So approximately 54, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip any terms. Let me recheck.

We have:

gamma = (20 ln3 ) / ln(3/2 )

Because from equation (1), 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) → 30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3).

Then equation (2): 30/(gamma c tau) = ln(3/2) → 30/(gamma) = c tau * ln(3/2) → but c tau = 30/(20 ln3 ) → substituting:

30/(gamma) = (30/(20 ln3 )) * ln(3/2) → divide both sides by 30:

1/gamma = (1/(20 ln3 )) * ln(3/2) → gamma = 20 ln3 / ln(3/2).

Yes, that's correct.

So gamma ≈20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ (21.972)/(0.4055) ≈54.17.

So the answer is approximately 54, which is option A.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particles' decay probability, and the distance they travel.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decay Probability and Lorentz Factor**:  
   The fraction of particles reaching the detector's inner walls is given by the survival probability, which is an exponential function of the particle's lifetime in the lab frame. The survival probability is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{survive}} = \exp\left(-\frac{L}{c \gamma \tau}\right),
   \]  
   where \(L = 30 \, \text{m}\) is the radius of the detector, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

2. **Initial Condition**:  
   At \(\gamma = 20\), one-third of the particles reach the walls. This gives:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}\right).
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau} = \ln(3).
   \]  
   This allows us to express \(c \cdot \tau\) as:  
   \[
   c \cdot \tau = \frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)}.
   \]

3. **Desired Condition**:  
   We want two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls, so:  
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau}\right).
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
   \]

4. **Solve for \(\gamma\)**:  
   From the initial condition, we know \(c \cdot \tau = \frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)}\). Substituting this into the desired condition:  
   \[
   \frac{30}{\gamma \cdot \left(\frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)}\right)} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   \frac{30 \cdot 20 \cdot \ln(3)}{\gamma \cdot 30} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
   \]  
   Cancel \(30\):  
   \[
   \frac{20 \cdot \ln(3)}{\gamma} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
   \]  
   Solve for \(\gamma\):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{20 \cdot \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
   \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:  
   Using \(\ln(3) \approx 1.0986\) and \(\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055\):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.17.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately **54**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
