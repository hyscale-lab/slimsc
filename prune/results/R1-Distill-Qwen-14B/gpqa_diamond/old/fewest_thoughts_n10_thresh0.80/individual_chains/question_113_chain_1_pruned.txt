Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I'll need to figure out what each of these techniques tells me and then see which formula fits.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch. Also, the problem mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe a ketone or an ester. But 1650 is a bit lower. Oh wait, maybe it's conjugated? Like an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some double bonds or an amide? Wait, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not amide.

Wait, another thought: if there are two carbonyl peaks, that suggests two different types of carbonyl groups. But wait, that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps one of them is a different kind of stretch. For example, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Because aromatic C=C usually absorb around 1600-1680 cm-1. Oh, so maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. But wait, the options are all C6H something, so maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, let me think again. The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So maybe the compound is an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But looking at the options: let's see their possible structures.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2 → (12 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (2)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But since it's C6H12O2, maybe two rings or one ring and a double bond.

B) C6H10O → (12 +2 -10 -0)/2 =4/2=2. So two double bonds or rings.

C) C6H10O2 → (12+2-10-0)/2=4/2=2. Two double bonds or rings.

D) C6H12O → (12+2-12-0)/2=2/2=1. One ring or double bond.

Wait, but the NMR says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, typically in alkenes or aromatic rings. So the compound likely has a double bond or aromatic ring. So the presence of vinyl H in NMR suggests an alkene or aromatic group.

Looking back at the FTIR: 1700 cm-1 is a strong peak. That's a carbonyl. So maybe an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid. But the O-H is broad, which again points to an acid or an alcohol.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, which fits the first FTIR peak. But then would a carboxylic acid have another carbonyl? Wait, no, because the carboxylic acid has a C=O. So maybe the 1700 is the carboxylic C=O, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. So the compound is a benzoic acid derivative? But let's see the options.

Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would appear around 1700-1750. But the O-H isn't present in esters, so that would conflict with the broad peak at 3000. So maybe the compound is a phenol? No, because phenol's O-H is also broad but perhaps less so than carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. But aldehydes have a sharp peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. But the broad peak at 3000 isn't aldehyde. So probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester. Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, like in a benzene ring or an alkene. So maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents that include a carbonyl group and an -OH group.

Wait, another angle: the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. What could that be? Let me think: 45 is a common mass for certain fragments. For example, the methyl group (CH3+) is 15, but that's not 45. Wait, the hexose ion? No, that's for sugars. Maybe it's the (CH2)2O fragment or something else. Alternatively, maybe a ketene ion or a fragment with a carbonyl group.

Wait, the molecular ion for our options:

Option A: C6H12O2 has a molecular weight of (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16) =72+12+32=116 g/mol.

Option B: C6H10O is 6×12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

So the molecular ion would be at 116, 98, 114, or 100. The fragment at m/z=45 is a smaller piece. Hmm, what could break off to give 45?

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone? No, acetone is (CH3)2CO: (3×12) + (6×1) +16=36+6+1
