Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method, but I think that's about how they discovered them, not directly relevant to the temperature question. Anyway, the key here is the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2.

All planets have the same albedo, so that factor should cancel out. Equilibrium temperature depends on a few things, right? I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the effective temperature of the star, R is the star's radius, and 'a' is the planet's orbital distance from the star.

Wait, but in this case, since all planets orbit the same star, T_star and R are constants. So the temperature ratio should only depend on the ratio of the square roots of their semi-major axes inversely. Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T_4 / T_2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4), but wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if a increases, T decreases.

Wait, let's get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * ( L_star / (16 * π^2 * sigma * a^2) )^(1/4) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Oh wait, I think I might have confused the formula a bit. Alternatively, the standard formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) assuming albedo is zero, but maybe that's only for certain simplifications.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the inverse square law for radiation. The flux received by a planet is F = F_star * (R_star / (2a))^2. Wait, or is it (L_star / (4π a²)) * (1 - albedo) / 4? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of ratios.

Let me think step by step. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is:

T_eq = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the semi-major axis.

Since all planets have the same albedo (A), and they orbit the same star (so L is same for all), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would be:

(T_eq4 / T_eq2) = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Because when you take (a²) in the denominator, each a is squared, so the ratio would be (a2/a4)^(1/2) under the square root. Wait, no, let me clarify.

The formula is T ∝ (1/a^2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). So
