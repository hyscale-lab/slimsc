Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. The question says we have an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field intensity pattern. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Wait, so when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinitely many sides is essentially a circle. So maybe this is a problem about circular aperture diffraction. I remember that the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is called the Airy disk. 

In the far field, the intensity distribution is given by the square of the Bessel functions. The minima occur where the Bessel function J1 has its zeros. The first minima are at certain angles. Let me recall, the first minimum of J1 occurs at a particular value. Oh right, I think the first minimum of J1 is at J1(x) = 0, which happens at x ≈ 3.8317. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, J1's first zero is at about 3.8317, but the minima in the Airy disk are actually the zeros of J1. So the first dark ring is when J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k is 2π/λ. 

Wait, but wait, when the aperture is circular, the primary maxima and minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The central spot is the brightest, and the first dark ring occurs at an angle θ where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317. So, for the first minimum, we set k a sinθ = 3.8317. So sinθ ≈ 3.8317/(k a). But wait, k is 2π/λ, so this becomes sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). 

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, the first minimum is at J1's first zero, and the second minimum would be at the second zero of J1, which is at x ≈ 7.0156. So the first minimum is at θ1 = arcsin( (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ), and the second minimum is θ2 = arcsin( (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) ). 

But wait, the problem states that the apothem is 'a'. Wait, in a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a polygon with N sides, the apothem is related to the radius. But when N approaches infinity, the apothem becomes equal to the radius of the circle. Hmm, wait, is that correct? Because for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the side, while the radius 'R' is the distance from the center to a vertex. As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' is equal to the radius R. Because for a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius. So in this case, the 'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.

Wait, but I think the formula for the first minimum in the Airy disk is given by sinθ = 1.22 λ/(π a), wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The first dark ring occurs when J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at about 3.8317. So, k a sinθ = 3.8317. So, sinθ = 3.8317/(k a). But k is 2π/λ, so substituting, sinθ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2 π a). Let me compute that value. 

3.8317 / (2 π) is approximately 3.8317 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.60998, which is about 0.61. So sinθ ≈ 0.61 λ / a. So θ ≈ 0.61 λ / a (since for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ in radians). 

Wait, but the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, wait. The first minimum is at θ1, the second at θ2. So the angular separation is θ2 - θ1. 

Wait, but in the case of a circular aperture, the intensity minima are at the zeros of J1. The first minima occur at θ1 as calculated, and the second at θ2. So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1.

Let me compute θ1 and θ2. 

θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ 0.61 λ/(a) radians.

θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(6.2832) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.116 λ/a.

So θ2 - θ1 ≈ (1.116 - 0.61) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, that's about 0.506 λ/a. Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: what if the question is just about the first minimum, and not the distance between the first two? Because sometimes, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/(a), but that's when using the radius as the first parameter. Oh wait, no, I think I mixed up something. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula for the first minimum in the single-slit diffraction (not circular) is at a sinθ = λ, but for circular, it's a more complicated Bessel function scenario. So in circular, the first minimum is at theta1 ≈ 1.22 λ/(a), because 1.22 is approximately 3.8317/(π), because 3.8317/(pi) is about 1.22. Wait
