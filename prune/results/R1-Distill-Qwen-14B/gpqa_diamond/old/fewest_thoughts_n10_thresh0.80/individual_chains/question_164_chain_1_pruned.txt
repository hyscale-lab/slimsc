Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, and when they eclipse each other, we can observe changes in their radial velocities. The question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor.

Alright, the problem gives me two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think relates to the orbital period of the binary system. So system_1 has a longer orbital period than system_2.

Then, there are the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have RV variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. So in system_1, one star is moving faster (10 km/s) than the other (5). In system_2, the stars move 15 and 10. I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star has a smaller orbit because it's closer to the center of mass. So the less massive star has a larger orbit and thus a higher velocity. Oh wait, no, actually, the star with lower mass would be moving faster because it's farther from the center of mass, so it has a larger orbit. So the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude. So in system_1, the 10 km/s star is less massive than the 5 km/s star? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence smaller velocity. Wait, no—wait, velocity depends on the size of the orbit and the period. But for a given period, a larger orbit (distance from the center of mass) leads to higher velocity. So the star with smaller mass has a larger orbit and higher velocity. So the more massive star has smaller velocity amplitude. So in system_1, the primary star (maybe) has a velocity of 10 km/s, and the companion has 5. So the primary is less massive than the companion? Wait no, that would be the opposite. Wait, no, the more massive star is the one with smaller velocity. So if a star has a larger velocity, it must be less massive. So in system_1, the star with velocity 10 is less massive than the one with 5? Wait, that can't be right because 10 is larger than 5. So that would imply that the 10 km/s star is less massive, and the 5 km/s star is more massive. So the more massive star in system_1 has a lower velocity. But that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass ratio. Let me define some variables. Let’s say in a binary system, star A has mass M_A and velocity v_A, and star B has mass M_B and velocity v_B. Since they are orbiting a common center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because the center of mass condition is M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B, where a_A and a_B are their orbital radii. Since velocity v is proportional to (2π a)/P, so v is proportional to a. So M_A / M_B = a_B / a_A, and since v_A = (2π a_A)/P, v_B = (2π a_B)/P. So M_A / M_B = (a_B) / (a_A) = (v_B P/(2π)) / (v_A P/(2π)) ) * (a_A / a_B?) Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

The mass function comes into play here. Wait, but perhaps I should think about the relationship between the velocities and the masses. The ratio of their masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocities. So M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A. Because M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B (since the momentum must be equal and opposite). So, the product M_A * v_A equals M_B * v_B. Because the center of mass doesn't move, so their momenta are equal in magnitude. So, M_A/M_B = v_B / v_A.

Right, so for system_1: velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So M1 (the more massive star) has v1 = 5? Wait no, because M1 would be the more massive, so it has lower velocity. Wait, no, in system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So let me clarify: which star is which? Let's say star A has velocity 10, star B has velocity 5. Then, M_A / M_B = v_B /
