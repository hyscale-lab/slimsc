Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. So each has charge 2e. But wait, the problem says 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So that means the 13th is at the center, and the 12 are arranged around it, all 2 meters away.

Wait, but how are they arranged? Since they're identical charges, they'd repel each other. But being constrained, perhaps they're placed symmetrically around point P. Maybe like the vertices of a regular dodecahedron or something? Hmm, wait, but 12 points could form a regular icosahedron or maybe a cube, but maybe it's a regular arrangement where each is equally spaced.

But wait, maybe the exact arrangement doesn't matter because the question is about the potential energy of the system. The potential energy for a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges.

But wait, since the 13th charge is fixed at P, the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the distance between any two of those 12 charges would be something else. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the distance between the 12 charges, only that they're each 2 meters from P. So maybe the distance between any two of them is the same? Or perhaps it's not needed for the calculation. Hmm.

Wait, but the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1*q2)/r. Since all charges are identical, each pair will contribute the same amount to the total potential energy. So perhaps I can compute the potential energy for each pair and multiply by the number of pairs.

Wait, but let's think about the system. The 12 charges are each a distance of 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge is fixed. So each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of two parts: the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is about the potential energy of the entire system. So each charge in the 12 contributes energy to the system in two ways: their energy with the central charge, and their energy with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 and the central charge, but I'm not sure.

No, I think the total potential energy of the system is the sum of all pairs. So that would be the energy between each of the 12 and the central one, plus the energy between each pair of the 12.

Wait, but let me think again. The system has 13 charges. So the interactions are:

1. The 13th charge (fixed at P) with each of the 12 others. So that's 12 interactions.

2. Each of the 12 charges with every other of the 12. So the number of pairs there is (12 choose 2) = 66.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of these two contributions.

But wait, each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e, and the 13th is also 2e, right? Because all 13 are identical, each has 2e.

Wait, but the 13th is fixed, but each of the 12 is 2e. So when calculating the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, it's (2e)*(2e)/(2m), because the distance is 2 meters.

Similarly, for each pair of the 12 charges, the distance between them is not given. Wait, wait a minute. Oh wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are all at a radius of 2 meters from P. But the distance between any two of them depends on the angle between them.

Hmm, but without knowing how they're arranged, how can we calculate the distances between each pair? Because the potential energy between a pair depends on their separation. So that's a problem.

Wait, but perhaps the system is arranged such that all 12 charges are equally spaced around P, forming a regular icosahedron or something with maximum symmetry. But without knowing the exact arrangement, maybe the problem is assuming that the distance between any two of the 12 charges is much larger than 2 meters, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the 12 and the central charge, and not between the 12 themselves. Because otherwise, the problem is missing some information about the distances between the 12. So maybe the question is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

Wait, let me re-read the question. It says, "What is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals?" So the minimum energy would be when the system is in the most stable configuration. But since all the 12 are identical and repelling each other, the minimum energy would be when they are as far apart as possible, which would mean arranging them at the vertices of a regular dodecahedron or icosahedron around point P, each 2 meters from P.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and not between the 12 themselves. Because otherwise, we need to know the distances between each pair, which we don't have.

Wait, but the problem says that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So perhaps the distance between any two of the 12 is not 2 meters, but something else, but unless told, we can't compute it.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12. Let me think. The potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 would be 12 * (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2). Because each of the 12 is at 2 m from the central charge.

Wait, but each of those interactions contributes to the total potential energy. Since each pair (central and one of the 12) is considered. So the total energy from that part is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2).

But wait, the potential energy for a pair is U = (k q1 q2)/r. Since each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central is 2e, each contributes (k*(2e)(2e))/2. So that's (k*(4e²))/2 = 2k e².

So 12 of these would be 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

Now, what about the energy between each pair of the 12 charges? Each pair would have a potential energy of (k*(2e)(2e))/r, where r is the distance between them. But since all 12 are at a radius of 2 m from P, the distance between two of them depends on the angle. For example, if they're diametrically opposite, the distance would be 4 m. Otherwise, it's less.

But without more information, we can't compute the exact distances. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges form a regular polygon around P, such that each pair is equidistant. Is that possible? Well, with 12 points, perhaps a regular icosahedron or a dodecahedron, but perhaps the problem is making a simplification.

Wait, maybe the problem neglects the interactions between the 12 charges. Because sometimes, in problems, if the charges are fixed on a sphere, the potential energy between them is considered, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others.

Wait, but the minimum energy of the system would involve all the interactions. Because if you have two positive charges, they repel each other, and that contributes to the potential energy. So if you have 12 charges all positive, repelling each other, the system's potential energy would be higher than if they were closer. So to find the minimum energy, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged as far apart as possible, but without knowing their arrangement, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the central charge and the 12, and not between the 12 themselves. But that can't be right because in reality, the 12 would have mutual repulsion, so their potential energy would add to the total.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the problem again. The 13th charge is fixed at P, the 12 are each 2 meters from P. The question is about the minimum energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual repulsion between the 12 charges is zero because they're arranged symmetrically and their contributions cancel out. No, that can't be right because the potential energy is a scalar, so the contributions from each pair would add up, not cancel.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the central charge. So the total energy is the sum of the potential energies between the central charge and each of the 12.

So the total potential energy U would be 12 * (k*(2e)*(2e)/(2)). Let me compute that.

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So let's compute this step by step.

Each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = (k * 4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Then multiply by 12: U = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me compute the numbers.

Wait, no, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge, so each contributes (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2) = (k *4 e²)/2 = 2 k e².

So 12 of these would sum to 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, substituting the values:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

So, compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute (1.602e-19)^2: (1.602)^2 is about 2.566, so 2.566e-38 C².

Then multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiplying those gives 8.988 * 2.566 = approximately 23. (Wait, 8 *2.5 is 20, 0.988*2.5 is about 2.47 → total around 22.47, but more accurately:

8.988 * 2.566 = Let's compute:

2.566 * 8 = 20.528,

2.566 * 0.988 ≈ 2.566 * 1 is 2.566, so subtract 2.566 *0.012=0.030792 → 2.566 - 0.030792 ≈ 2.535.

So total is 20.528 + 2.535 ≈ 23.063.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.063e-29 → 2.3063e-28.

Wait, exponents: 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.063e-29 = 2.3063e-28.

Now, multiply by 24:

24 * 2.3063e-28 = 55.351e-28 → 5.5351e-27.

Wait, but that would make the energy approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about twice that. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e². So each term is (k * (2e)^2)/(r), where r is 2 m.

So each term is (k *4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Wait, no, 4e² divided by 2 is 2e². So each term is 2 k e².

Wait, 2e is the charge, so (2e)^2 is 4e². So (k * 4e²)/2 is 2 k e².

Then 12 such terms would be 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, so 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute (1.602e-19)^2 again.

(1.602)^2 = approximately (1.6)^2 = 2.56. 1.602^2 exactly is 2.566404.

So (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566404e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:

8.988e9 * 2.566404e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566404 = let me compute that accurately.

8 * 2.566404 = 20.531232

0.988 * 2.566404 → 2.566404 * 1 is 2.566404; subtract 0.012 * 2.566404.

0.012 *2.566404 = 0.030796848.

So 2.566404 - 0.030796848 = 2.535607152.

So total is 20.531232 + 2.535607152 = 23.066839152.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566404e-38 = 23.066839152e-29 → 2.3066839152e-28.

Multiply by 24:

24 * 2.3066839152e-28 = ?

24 * 2.3066839152 = let's compute:

20 * 2.3066839152 = 46.133678304

4 * 2.3066839152 = 9.2267356608

Total: 46.133678304 +9.2267356608 = 55.3604139648.

So 55.3604139648e-28 → 5.53604e-27 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher.

But wait, perhaps I missed the mutual repulsion between the 12 charges. Let's think again.

Wait, each pair of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy. So I need to compute that as well.

So the total potential energy is U = U_central + U_pairs.

U_central is the energy between the 13th and the 12, which is 24 k e² (as computed earlier).

U_pairs is the sum of all interactions between the 12 charges. Each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two of the 12 charges.

But wait, without knowing the exact arrangement, how can we find r_ij for each pair?

Unless the problem is making an assumption that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equidistant from the others, but that's only possible for certain numbers, like 6 points on a circle (hexagon), but 12 doesn't fit that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are much larger, but that doesn't make sense because the 12 charges are constrained to be at 2 meters from P, so some will be closer to each other than 2 meters, depending on the arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual energy between the 12.

But that's probably not the case because the problem states it's an isolated system, so all interactions must be considered.

But without knowing the distances, this seems impossible. So perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the 12 charges are arranged such that the distance between any two is the same as their distance from the center, but that's not possible unless they're arranged in a regular simplex, which for 12 points in 3D space isn't possible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distances are at infinity, but that's not the case because they're all at 2m from P.

Wait, but maybe the problem is intended to ignore the mutual repulsion between the 12 charges, perhaps because they're fixed in place and the question is only about the energy with the central charge. But that feels a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a symmetric pattern where the mutual potential energy cancels out, but that's not correct because electric potential energy is scalar and each pair contributes positively (since they're like charges) to the total energy.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that only the central charge contributes to the potential energy, and the mutual interactions are either negligible or not considered.

If that's the case, then the energy is 5.536e-27 J, which isn't one of the options. The options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Wait, 5.5e-27 is about 5.536e-27, but the closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. No, for the central charge, each of the 12 contributes, so 12 terms.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

First, let's compute (2e)^2 = 4e².

Each pair between the central and a 12 charge is (k * 4e²) / (2m) = (k *4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So 12 of them: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So plugging the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

So 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2: (1.602)^2 is 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 *2.566 = approx 23.066e-29, which is 2.3066e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3066e-28 = 5.5358e-27 J.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 30% higher.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the number of pairs. Wait, wait, another thought: the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges interacts with it once. So that's 12 interactions.

But when considering all the pairs in the system, including the 12 charges among themselves, the number of pairs is (12 *13)/2, but wait, no: the 13th is fixed, so the pairs are:

- 13th with each of the 12 → 12 pairs.

- Each of the 12 with each other → (12 choose 2) =66 pairs.

So the total number of pairs is 12+66=78.

But the problem is that without knowing the distances between the 12, I can't compute their contributions. So perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 pairs with the central charge, and not the 66 pairs among themselves.

But that would make the energy approximately 5.5e-27 J, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times 5.64e-26.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each interaction is counted twice, but no, in potential energy, each pair is considered once.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the charges are 2e each, so each charge is 2e. So when calculating the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, it's (k * (2e) * (2e))/r.

Which is (4 e² k)/r.

But r is 2 m, so 4 e² k / (2) = 2 e² k.

So each interaction is 2 k e².

Multiply by 12, gives 24 k e².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute this accurately.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2:

1.602 * 1.602 = approx 2.566.

So 2.566e-38.

Now, multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 *2.566 = approx 23.066, times 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So 23.066e-29 → 2.3066e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.3066e-28 = 55.3584e-28 → 5.5358e-27 J.

So the energy is approximately 5.5358e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, but since the 13th is fixed, the energy is actually the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their position. So for each of the 12 charges, the energy is (k * 2e * 2e) / (2m) ), which is (4e² k)/(2) = 2e² k.

Multiply by 12: 24 e² k.

Wait, same as before. So that gives 5.5358e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at 2 meters, but perhaps the 13th is also a charge, so when you bring in each of the 12 charges, you have to account for the repulsion from the other 11 as well as from the central charge.

Wait, no, the potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions. So when you bring in each charge, you have to account for the work done against the electric field of all existing charges.

Wait, but in this problem, the 13th charge is fixed, so when you bring in each of the 12, you only have to consider the electric field from the 13th charge, not from the other 11, because they are being brought in one by one. So perhaps the mutual energy between the 12 is considered when they are all in place.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to calculate only the energy between the 13th and the 12, and not the energy between the 12 themselves, but that would give an answer that's not among the options.

Wait, maybe I should think about the system's potential energy as the sum of all pairs. So U = U_central + U_12pairs.

But without knowing the distances between the 12, I can't compute U_12pairs, so perhaps the problem is assuming that U_12pairs is zero or negligible, which I don't think is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct approach is only considering the central charge, leading to an energy of ~5.5e-27 J, but that's not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is in electron volts, but the options are in joules.

Wait, but the options are in joules, so we can proceed.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recheck:

(1.602e-19 C)^2 = (1.602)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9 (N·m²/C²): 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.566 *8.988 = approx 23.066e-29 (since 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29).

So 23.066e-29 → 2.3066e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.3066e-28 = 55.358e-28 →5.5358e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at the options again. The options are:

A)5.645e-26 → 5.645e-26 J = 56.45e-25.

B)2.822e-26 → 28.22e-25.

C)7.056e-27 → 7.056e-27.

D)122.330.

Our calculated value is 5.536e-27, which is roughly 5.5e-27. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 30% higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again.

Wait, the central charge is fixed. Each of the 12 charges contributes an energy of (2e)(2e)/(2) *k, right? So that's 4e²/(2) *k = 2e²k per charge. So 12 charges: 24 e²k.

So 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with more precise numbers.

Let me compute (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 = 2.566004, so 2.566004e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566004e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566004) * 1e-29.

Compute 8.988 * 2.566004:

8 * 2.566004 = 20.528032

0.988 * 2.566004 = let's compute:

2.566004 * 0.988 = ?

Well, 2.566004 * 1 = 2.566004.

Subtract 2.566004 * 0.012 = approx 0.030792.

So 2.566004 - 0.030792 ≈ 2.535212.

So total is 20.528032 + 2.535212 = 23.063244.

So 23.063244e-29 → 2.3063244e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3063244e-28 = 55.3517856e-28 →5.53517856e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before. So about 5.535e-27 J.

So perhaps none of the options match. But the options given don't include this value. The closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think: when you calculate the potential energy between two point charges, it's U = (k q1 q2)/r. But when you have multiple charges, each pair is considered once. So perhaps I didn't account for something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in terms of the work done to assemble the system, which would include both bringing each charge into place and accounting for their mutual repulsion as you add each charge.

In that case, the total energy would be the sum of the potential energies for each step.

When assembling the system:

1. Place the 13th charge at P. No energy required because it's fixed.

2. Bring in each of the 12 charges one by one. For each charge, the work done is the potential energy it has at its position, which is due to the central charge plus the other charges already placed.

Wait, but this complicates things because as you bring in each charge, the existing charges would exert a repulsive force, but since they're all placed at 2 m from P, perhaps their mutual repulsion is considered when calculating the work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is brought into place by the central charge's field, so each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2.

But that brings us back to the same calculation.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around P, each at 2m from P. The distance between any two adjacent charges would then be the same. Let's compute that.

But wait, in a regular icosahedron, the distance between two adjacent vertices can be calculated based on the radius. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between two charges on a sphere of radius R is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them as viewed from the center.

But without knowing theta, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the mutual distances are much larger than 2 meters, so their contributions to the potential energy are negligible. But that's not the case because the charges are all at 2m from P, so the distances between them can't be much larger than 4m (if they're on opposite sides of P). But for most pairs, they'll be much closer than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge, and not the mutual repulsion, so the energy is 5.535e-27 J, which isn't an option, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

Using k =9e9 N·m²/C².

So 24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

24 *9e9=216e9.

So 216e9 * 2.566e-38 = 216 *2.566 = approx 553. 553e-29 →5.53e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation gives 5.535e-27 J, which isn't an option. The closest is option C with 7.056e-27. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering both the central charge and the 12 charges as 2e each, but when the 12 charges are brought into place, the potential energy between each of them and the central charge is (k*(2e)*(2e))/2 = 2 k e².

So 12 *2 k e² = 24 k e².

But perhaps I'm forgetting that the central charge's potential energy is considered once, and each of the 12 contributes. Alternatively, perhaps the central charge is being counted multiple times, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of n charges each at a distance r from a central charge, which is U = (n k q²)/(r).

In that case, with n=12, q=2e, r=2m.

U = 12 * k * (2e)^2 / 2 =12 * k *4e² /2 = 12 *2 k e² =24 k e².

Same as before.

So, the calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 12 charges, not the central one.

Wait, that would make no sense because the 13th charge is fixed and the others are at 2m from it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves, assuming they form a regular icosahedron.

But without knowing the exact distances, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other, which would be the case if they're arranged as a regular polygon around P, but in 3D that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges form a regular icosahedron around P, each at 2m from P, and the distance between any two adjacent charges is the same.

But without knowing the exact distance, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the central charge and the 12, and the correct answer is 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as the one we're bringing in, and the 12 are already in place. So the potential energy would be the work done by the 12 charges on the 13th as it's being fixed at P.

No, that doesn't make sense because the 13th is fixed at P, and the 12 are at 2m from P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a single charge in the field of others, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which isn't correct, but maybe they are arranged symmetrically so that their contributions cancel, but that's not the case for potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a point charge in the field of a ring of charges, but I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about five times 5.645e-26 (option A). Hmm, not directly related.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is using the number of pairs as (12 *13)/2, but that would be 78 pairs, which would include the central charge's 12 pairs and the 66 between the 12.

But without knowing the distances, this doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total potential energy of the system, which includes all pairs. So I need to compute both the central charge's interactions and the 12 charges' mutual interactions.

But without the distances between the 12, I can't compute the latter. So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge, leading to 5.5e-27 J, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a dipole or something else, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge value. The problem says each charge is 2e. So when calculating (2e)^2, that's 4e².

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it as (2e)^2 =4e², and then multiply by k, so 4e² k.

So 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Wait, 4 times that, let me compute.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 4: 10.264e-38.

Then multiply by 8.988e9: 10.264e-38 *8.988e9 = 10.264 *8.988 = approx 91.38, times 1e-29.

So 91.38e-29 →9.138e-28.

Multiply by 12: 12 *9.138e-28 =109.656e-28 →1.09656e-26 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 1.097e-26 J, which is close to option B)2.822e-26, but not exactly.

Wait, but I'm not sure why I multiplied by 4 again. Wait, no, earlier calculation was correct: each term is (k*(2e)^2)/r, which is (k*4e²)/2.

So perhaps I should recast the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each step again carefully.

Compute (2e)^2 =4e² =4*(1.602e-19)^2 =4*(2.566e-38) =10.264e-38.

Each pair with the central charge contributes (k *4e²)/(2) = (8.988e9 *10.264e-38)/(2).

Compute that: 8.988e9 *10.264e-38 = 8.988 *10.264 = approx 92.31, times 1e-29 →92.31e-29 =9.231e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6155e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.6155e-28 *12 = 55.386e-28 =5.5386e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the electric potential energy of a system of point charges, considering all pairs, including the central charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, so the mutual potential energy cancels out, but that's not true because potential energy is a scalar and all terms are positive (like charges repel).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2m, but that's impossible because 12 points can't all be 2m apart from each other and from P.

Wait, no, that's not possible. The distance from P is 2m, but their mutual distances would vary.

In any case, perhaps the correct approach is to only consider the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, which gives 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, which is roughly 30% higher than my calculation.

But I can't see where the mistake is. Maybe I should check the formula again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from P, but the distance between any two charges is 4m (diametrically opposite), but that's not the case for all pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, and the distance between any two is 4m, which is incorrect because that's only if they're on opposite ends.

But that's not possible for 12 charges; they can't all be opposite each other.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is making a mistake in the options, and the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26, but I can't see how that would come about.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation with precise numbers.

Compute (2e)^2 = (2 *1.602176634e-19 C)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 = 10.2654316e-38 C².

Then, each term is (k * (2e)^2 ) / r = (8.988e9 N·m²/C² * 10.2654316e-38 C² ) / 2 m.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *10.2654316e-38 = 8.988 *10.2654316 = approx 92.33 → 92.33e-29.

Divide by 2: 46.165e-29 →4.6165e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.6165e-28 *12 =55.398e-28 →5.5398e-27 J.

So 5.54e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the charge as e, not 2e. Let me see what happens if I use e instead of 2e.

If each charge is e, then each term is (k e²)/(2).

So 12 terms: 12 * (k e²/2) =6 k e².

Compute 6 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

So 6 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =6 * (8.988 *2.566) =6 *23.066 =138.396e-29 →1.38396e-27 J.

That's about 1.38e-27 J, which is not an option either.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match my calculation, perhaps I should consider that the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I can't see where the error in my calculation is. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the mutual energy between the 12 charges, but without knowing the distances, it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a single charge in the field of a ring of charges. Let me consider that.

If the 12 charges are arranged in a ring around P, each at 2m, then the potential energy of a charge brought to P would be influenced by the ring.

But the 13th charge is fixed at P, so perhaps that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy of a single charge in the field of the ring is zero, but that's not the case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, which is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =24 k e².

So, using precise calculations:

24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute as follows:

(1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 =2.566004e-38.

Multiply by8.988e9: 2.566004e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.566004 *8.988 = approx 23.066 →23.066e-29 →2.3066e-28.

Multiply by24:2.3066e-28 *24=55.3584e-28 →5.53584e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the mutual energy between the 12 charges as well, but without more information, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges form a regular dodecahedron with each charge at 2m from P, and the distance between any two adjacent charges is r. Then, the potential energy between each pair would be (k*(2e)^2)/r.

But without knowing r, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of n charges arranged in a regular polygon, but I don't have the exact formula.

In conclusion, after careful consideration, I think the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't spot it.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy, which includes contributions from all pairwise interactions. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \).

### Key Contributions to Potential Energy
1. **Energy Between the Central Charge and the 12 Charges**:  
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge. The potential energy for each pair is given by:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this contribution is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
   \]

2. **Energy Between the 12 Charges Themselves**:  
   The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from \( P \), but their mutual distances are not specified. Without explicit information about their arrangement, the distances between the 12 charges cannot be determined. Thus, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges cannot be calculated and is likely neglected in this problem.

### Calculation of \( U_{\text{central}} \)
Using \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):  
\[
U_{\text{central}} = 24k e^2 = 24 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2
\]  
First, calculate \( e^2 \):  
\[
e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]  
Then, calculate \( k \cdot e^2 \):  
\[
k \cdot e^2 = 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 2.306 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
\]  
Finally, multiply by 24:  
\[
U_{\text{central}} = 24 \cdot 2.306 \times 10^{-28} = 5.534 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated energy \( U_{\text{central}} \approx 5.534 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 28% higher than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup, such as neglecting the mutual energy between the 12 charges or rounding differences.

### Conclusion
Given the available options and the calculations, the most reasonable choice is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**.  

Answer: C
