Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a chemistry problem, probably related to NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly right, except for two peaks that are from the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Wait, that's interesting. So each peak is about 0.5H integral? Or maybe they're overlapping but split due to something else. The question says the peaks are from the same alpha-H, which suggests maybe it's a diastereotopic situation or some kind of coupling.

But the question also says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't explain it. So, if it's not J-coupling, what else could cause extra peaks?

Then looking at the LC-MS part: two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So the mass is consistent, but they have the same mass but different in some way that the LC can separate them. Hmm. Same mass but different something else. Maybe isomers, like diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but if it's enantiomers, LC would usually not separate them because they have the same physical properties except in chiral columns. Oh, but the question says it's at elevated temperature. Maybe the LC is using a chiral column? Or perhaps the separation is due to something else. Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are not enantiomers but diastereomers, which would have different physical properties and thus separate on LC.

So, the options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The precursor would have a different mass, right? Because the mass in LC-MS is the same. So if there's a precursor, the mass would be higher, say, the molecular ion would be different. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected, so this is probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same mass, and in a normal LC (without a chiral column), they would co-elute. Unless the LC is chiral. But the question says the peaks in LC-MS are clearly defined and equal. So if the LC is a chiral column, then enantiomers would split into
