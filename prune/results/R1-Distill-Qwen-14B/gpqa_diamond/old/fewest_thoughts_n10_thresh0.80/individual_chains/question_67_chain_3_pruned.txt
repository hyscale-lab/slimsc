Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So the setup is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l, so for a p orbital, l is 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, I remember that the notation usually goes |l1, l2, L, M>, right? So l1 and l2 are each 1, the total L is 2, and M is -1.

The question is about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z and getting -ħ each. Wait, L1z and L2z are the individual z-components of the orbital angular momenta for each electron. Since each electron has l=1, their orbital angular momentum can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ, right? Because Lz = mħ, and m can be -l, ..., +l. So for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1, which translates to eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, +ħ.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. I'm trying to figure out what this state represents. I think it's an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators L² and Lz. So the coupled state is the combination of the two individual angular momenta.

Wait, when you have two particles, the total angular momentum L is the vector sum of l1 and l2. So the possible values of L can be |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Since both l1 and l2 are 1, L can be 0, 1, or 2. The given state has L=2, which is the maximum possible, so that's the triplet state where the spins are aligned. But wait, wait, wait, no, this is orbital angular momentum, not spin. Oh, but the question says to ignore spin. So we're only considering the orbital parts.

In any
