Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states are the eigenstates of σz, which I remember are the Pauli matrices. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. I need to find this expectation value and choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I should probably recall what the expectation value means. The expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable on a large number of identical systems in the same state. For a given state |ψ⟩, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I think I can compute the expectation value by linearity of expectation. That is, the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations. So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Alright, so I can compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately, then multiply each by their coefficients and add them together.

Wait, but how do I compute each of these expectation values?

Let me think about σz first. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, calculating ⟨σz⟩ should be straightforward. For a state |ψ⟩ that's a linear combination, the expectation value of σz is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes times their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, the eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right? Because σz|↑⟩ = +|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩. So each eigenstate gives an eigenvalue of either +1 or -1.

So the state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write the coefficients as a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. Then, the expectation value of σz would be |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1).

Calculating |a|^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. And |b|^2: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Hmm, that seems right. So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now onto ⟨σx⟩. Oh, this seems trickier because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So σx doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates, so I can't directly use the same approach as with σz.

Wait, I think I should express σx in terms of the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis. Alternatively, perhaps I should write the matrix representation of σx and compute the expectation value.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So σx in the basis {|↑⟩, |↓⟩} has those matrix elements.

The state |ψ⟩ is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So in vector form, it's a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

To compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can compute ψ† * σx * ψ
