Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be substituted carboxylic acids. Let's break down the given data.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since all the options have a COOH group, that makes sense. The O-H stretch in carboxylic acids is usually very broad, around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But wait, the peak here is at 3000, which is a bit lower than the typical O-H. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but maybe it's correct because the broadening might cover a range. Additionally, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with the carboxylic acid group because the carbonyl in COOH is around 1700 cm^-1. So that matches.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data: several signals, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or maybe the double bonds are not with protons attached. That suggests maybe branching or some other structure without allylic protons. All the structures given are saturated except for any possible double bonds elsewhere—wait, checking the options, all the structures are with single bonds except for maybe substituents. So they're all aliphatic.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That sounds complicated, but I think it's about the splitting patterns indicating neighboring protons.

Looking at the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Let me see. This structure has a central carbon attached to two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH. So each C(H) is attached to two ethyls and a CH2COOH. The central CH is attached to two CH2 groups (from ethyls), or wait—the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central two carbons each have two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH. Wait no, the structure is more like:

The molecule is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle two carbons has a H, two ethyl groups, and a CH2COOH. So each of those middle CH's would have how many neighboring H's?

Wait, each CH is connected to two ethyl groups (each ethyl has two CH2 groups, but perhaps the neighboring carbons have H's. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to draw their structures mentally.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure here would be CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons (let's number them 2 and 3) have a CH3 group attached. So each has one H and two CH3 groups. Then, the central CH's are attached. The CH2 from CH3CH2- is on carbon 1, then C2 is CH(CH3), C3 is CH(CH3), and then COOH on C4.

So for option D, the NMR would show the H's on C2 and C3. Each of these H's is attached to a CH that's next to another CH (on C3
