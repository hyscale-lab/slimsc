Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different types of acetates: cis or trans with propenyl or butenyl groups.

First, let me recall what these compounds look like. Acetates are esters, right? So the general structure is R-O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, wait. Acetate would be something like CH3COO-R, where R is the alkyl or alkenyl group. Oh, wait, for propenyl acetate, it's CH3COO-CH2CH2CH2- but wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but as an ester, it's CH3COOCH2CH2CH2- but wait, that's not right. Oh, wait, esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So in this case, the unknown compound is an acetate, so the R' is methyl (from acetic acid), so the structure is CH3COO-R, where R is some group.

Looking at the options, the R groups are either propenyl or butenyl, and whether they're cis or trans. So for propenyl, that's CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so as an ester, it's CH3COOCH2CH2CH2-, but that's not correct because that's a straight chain. Wait, no, the actual structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, the propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2- but wait, that can't be right because the double bond is in the middle. Wait
