Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, okay, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, right? But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps to take here.

Let me read the problem again. It says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I guess I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. But I'm not sure if they'll all react completely. Oh, right, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, in this case, with multiple acids and a base, I'm a bit confused. How do they all react together?

Let me think. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely into H+ and Cl- ions. H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but wait, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is
