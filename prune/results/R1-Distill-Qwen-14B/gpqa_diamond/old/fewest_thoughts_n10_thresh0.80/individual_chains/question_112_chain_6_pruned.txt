Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything from my notes. Let me read through it again.

The question says that there's an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So that part is familiar—those are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The first task is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so if i≠j, it's hbar/2, else zero? So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. That sounds like a specific matrix structure.

Wait, what does that matrix look like? For a spin-½ system, the basis states are |up> and |down>. So the matrix A would be:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Wait no, wait. Wait, no, because in a 2x2 matrix, i and j run from 1 to 2. So when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So position (1,2) and (2,1) are hbar/2, and (1,1) and (2,2) are 0. So the matrix is all zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. So that's the matrix.

But wait, what operator has that form? Because in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices come to mind. The Pauli X matrix, for example, is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if I multiply that by hbar/2, I get exactly this matrix. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Pauli X is the spin-flip operator, which swaps |up> and |down>.

So the eigenstates of the operator A are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of Pauli X are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the problem now reduces to finding the probability of measuring the system in |+x> and |-x> states, given the initial state |alpha>.

Wait, but first, the initial state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me write that as |alpha> = C [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], where C is the normalization constant.

So I need to compute C first. The normalization condition is that <alpha|alpha> = 1. So compute the inner product.

First, compute the coefficients:

Coefficient of |up> is (1+i), coefficient of |down> is (2-i).

The inner product is (1-i)*C*(1+i) + (2+i)*C*(2-i). Because when you take the conjugate, (1+i)* becomes (1-i), and (2-i)* becomes (2+i).

Wait no, wait: the inner product of |up> and |down> is zero, so the cross terms would vanish when computing |alpha|^2.

So compute |1+i|^2 and |2-i|^2, then sum them for the normalization.

Wait, |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2? Because (1+i)(1-i)=1 +1=2.

Similarly, |2-i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7), so C is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, I need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, what are the eigenstates of Pauli X (A in this case)? They are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because Pauli X is the bit-flip operator.

Wait, no, wait: the eigenstates of X are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2), but in terms of our basis, |up> is |0> and |down> is |1>. So yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probability, I need to find the overlap between |alpha> and |+x>, and |alpha> and |-x>, then square the magnitudes to get probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can expand |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis and find the coefficients.

Let me write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, any state can be expressed as a combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

I can solve for a and b by taking inner products. Alternatively, I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner products.

So, the probability of measuring |+x> is | < +x | alpha > |^2, and similarly for |-x>.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | + < down | ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So this equals (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i. So 3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | - < down | ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i.

So the magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (
