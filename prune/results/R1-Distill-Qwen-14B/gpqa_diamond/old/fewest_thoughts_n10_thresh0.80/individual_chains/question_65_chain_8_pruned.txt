Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each. Then, I'll match them with the options given.

First reaction:
1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacting with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A.

Second reaction:
(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, LDA, to give product B.

Hmm, I need to analyze each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure here is a spiro compound with two rings: one is a 3-membered (probably cyclopropane) and the other a 5-membered ring? Wait, no, spiro[3.5]non... so the main chain is nonane, with a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring fused at one carbon. The 1-vinyl means there's a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the spiro atom.

Adding THF, which is a solvent. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. And then H+ is probably an acid workup. So what kind of reaction conditions are these?

Potassium hydride is a strong base. It can deprotonate things. Wait, but the starting alcohol is an enol, perhaps. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the alcohol is on the spiro carbon, which is also connected to the vinyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the structure. The spiro atom is the one where the two rings meet. So we have a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring fused at that spiro carbon. The 1-vinyl group is on that same carbon. So the structure is a spiro compound where the central carbon has a hydroxyl group (since it's an alcohol) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

When we treat this with a strong base like KH (which is a source of H-), maybe we're looking at an elimination reaction. Wait, but what's the structure here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, another possibility: the starting alcohol could undergo some kind of elimination, especially under basic conditions. But with spiro compounds, sometimes they can undergo ring-opening via acid or base. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or some cyclization.

Wait, but the presence of THF and KH: perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by cyclization. Let's think about possible mechanisms.

The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the structure is
