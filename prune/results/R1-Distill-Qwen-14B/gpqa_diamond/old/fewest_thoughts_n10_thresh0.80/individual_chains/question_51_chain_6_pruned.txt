Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system.

First, I remember that when a conducting sphere is grounded, it's connected to the Earth, which means the potential at the surface of the sphere is zero. But wait, does that affect the charge distribution on the sphere? Oh right, for a conducting sphere, the charges reside on the surface. So when a charge is placed near it, the sphere's charges will redistribute.

Wait, but waitâ€”what's the induced charge here? If the charge q is placed outside the sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. Since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would go to the ground, right? Hmm, no, wait. No, because the sphere is a conductor. When you bring a charge near a conductor, the charges in the conductor (sphere) will rearrange. But since it's grounded, the sphere can lose or gain electrons to stay at zero potential.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the method of images. That's used in problems with conducting spheres and point charges. The image method says that the induced charges can be represented by an image charge inside the sphere.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize this. The charge q is outside the sphere. So the sphere being a conductor
