Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by breaking it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron's state and some probabilities and an average value. I remember that in quantum mechanics, states are represented as vectors, and probabilities come from the square of the amplitudes.

The state given is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Wait, proportional, so I'll have to normalize it. Right, because the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients must equal 1.

So first, let's find the normalization factor. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 -i). The absolute squares are |1+i|² and |2 -i|².

Calculating each: |1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. And |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the operator given has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what are i and j here? I think the indices refer to the basis states. So for a 2x2 system, the operator matrix would be:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0     ]

Because when i and j are different, the elements are hbar/2, and diagonal elements (i=j) are 0.

Wait, that's a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. Hmm, what operator is this? Oh, that looks like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply by hbar/2, you get the matrix given. So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the question is about measuring the system in the eigenstates of this operator. So the measurement basis is |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, but our state is in the z-basis (|up> and |down>). So to find the probabilities, I'll need to express |alpha> in the x-basis.

Alternatively, since the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. But perhaps more accurately, the eigenvalues are hbar/2 times the eigenvalues of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the operator's eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator. So each eigenstate is |+x> and |-x>. So we need to find the probability that the state |alpha> is in |+x> or in |-x>.

So to find that, I can compute the overlap between |alpha> and each of the |+x> and |-x> states.

What are |+x> and |-x> in the z-basis? I recall that |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, etc.

So let's write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Alternatively, maybe I should represent them as 1/sqrt(2) times (1,1) and (1,-1) in the z-basis.

Wait, let's write |alpha> as a vector in the z-basis. |alpha> is (a, b), where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So in vector form: |alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 , (2 - i)/√7 ]^T.

Now, to find the probability of each outcome when measuring in the x-basis, I need to compute the projections onto |+x> and |-x>.

The inner product < +x | alpha > is the amplitude for measuring +x. Similarly for < -x | alpha >.

Let's compute these inner products.

First, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Inner product with |alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Simplify the numerator: (1+i + 2 -i) = 3. So this becomes (1/sqrt(2)) * (3/sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude. So |3/(sqrt(14))|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, the amplitude for |-x> is the inner product with |-x>.

|-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra vector is (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

Inner product: (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ].

Numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is ( (-1 + 2i) ) / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The square of the absolute value is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me recheck these calculations.

Wait, for |+x>:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Inner product with |+x> is (a + b)/sqrt(2), right?

Wait, no. Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when taking the inner product with |alpha>, it's (a)(1/sqrt(2)) + (b)(1/sqrt(2)) ) = (a + b)/sqrt(2).

So a + b is (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) → (3) / sqrt(7).

So (a + b)/sqrt(2) = 3/( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) )= 3 / sqrt(14).

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), and the probability is (3^2)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428.

Similarly, for |-x>, it's (a - b)/sqrt(2). Let's compute a - b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
a - b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ -1 + 2i ] / sqrt(7).

So (a - b)/sqrt(2) = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The absolute value squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.64 and 0.36 as I initially thought. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So option A's probabilities match.

But wait, let's make sure. 9/14 is 0.642857... So 0.64 is accurate to two decimal places. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimals. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me check the average value of the operator. The operator is A, whose matrix is [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ].

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2.

So average value is (hbar/2) * <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the state is |alpha>, which is in the z-basis, perhaps we can compute <sigma_x> = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Sigma_x in the z-basis is [[0,1],[1,0]], so let's compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

In matrix terms, |alpha> is a column vector [a, b]^T, where a=(1+i)/√7, b=(2 - i)/√7.

The bra vector is [ a*, b* ].

So sigma_x |alpha> is [ b, a ]^T.

Then <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = a* b + b* a.

So a* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = (1 - i)(2 - i) /7.

Let me compute that: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 → (1 -3i).

Similarly, b* a is (2 + i)(1 + i)/7.

(2)(1) + (2)(i) + i(1) + i(i) → 2 + 2i +i +i² → 2 + 3i -1 → (1 +3i).

So a* b + b* a = (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) /7 → (2)/7.

Wait, so <sigma_x> is 2/7. Then the average value of the operator A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar /7.

Putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is hbar/7. So looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that matches.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me confirm the average value calculation.

Another way: the operator A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So <A> = Tr( A rho ), where rho is |alpha><alpha|.

Alternatively, compute the expectation value as:

(alpha| A |alpha) = (hbar/2) * (alpha| [[0,1],[1,0]] |alpha).

Which is (hbar/2) [ <up| + <down| ] [ [0,1],[1,0] ] [ |up>, |down> ] multiplied by the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute it as (hbar/2)( <up|down> + <down|up> ) but wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no. Let me write |alpha> as a vector: [a, b], then A |alpha> is [b, a].

So <alpha| A |alpha> = a* b + b* a.

Which is the same as before, 2 Re(a* b) ?

Wait, in our case:

a* = (1 -i)/√7.

b = (2 -i)/√7.

a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

So the real part is 1, imaginary part is -3.

So a* b is (1-3i)/7, and b* a is (1+3i)/7.

Adding them: (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> is 2/7. Then <A> = (hbar/2)(2/7) )= hbar/7.

So that matches.

Looking back at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 (which are 9/14 and 5/14) and average hbar/7.

So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron's state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator with matrix representation A, where Aij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of the operator must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |α⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the absolute squares of the coefficients:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), and the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Express the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This corresponds to \((\hbar/2)\sigma_x\), where \(\sigma_x\) is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of \(\sigma_x\) are \(|+x⟩ = (|up⟩ + |down⟩)/\sqrt{2}\) and \(|-x⟩ = (|up⟩ - |down⟩)/\sqrt{2}\), with eigenvalues \(+1\) and \(-1\), respectively. Therefore, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of \(\sigma_x\), and the eigenvalues of A are \(+\hbar/2\) and \(-\hbar/2\).

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \(|+x⟩\) and \(|-x⟩\), we compute the overlap of |α⟩ with these states. In the z-basis, \(|+x⟩ = (|up⟩ + |down⟩)/\sqrt{2}\) and \(|-x⟩ = (|up⟩ - |down⟩)/\sqrt{2}\). The inner products are:
\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1+4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of A
The average value of A is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α | A | α \rangle.
\]
Since \(A = (\hbar/2)\sigma_x\), we compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle α | \sigma_x | α \rangle.
\]
In the z-basis, \(\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and |α⟩ is represented as:
\[
|α⟩ = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \\ \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle α | \sigma_x | α \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{(1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1+i)}{7}.
\]
Expanding:
\[
(1+i)(2-i) = 2 - i + 2i - i^2 = 2 + i + 1 = 3 + i, \quad (2-i)(1+i) = 2 + 2i - i - i^2 = 2 + i + 1 = 3 + i.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{(3+i) + (3+i)}{7} = \frac{6 + 2i}{7} \implies \text{Real part is } \frac{6}{7}.
\]
Therefore:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), and the average value of the operator is \(\hbar/7\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
