Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a dicarboxylic acid that's been dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. The products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3, and their NOESY NMR spectra show some differences. The major product has a cross-peak in its NOESY, while the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, let's understand the starting materials. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The NMR data of the anhydride is given: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Hmm, what could that mean?

In the 1H NMR, a singlet at 7 ppm suggests maybe an aromatic proton, but wait, that's usually in the 7 ppm region. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid that becomes an anhydride. Anhydrides typically have carbonyl groups, but maybe the structure has some conjugated double bonds or something else. Alternatively, the 7 ppm peak might be from an aromatic ring, perhaps a substituted benzene. Wait, but the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride, which would have two ester-like groups. But if the anhydride has a double bond... perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is around the range for a spÂ² hybridized carbon, maybe a carbon in a double bond. 165 is a carbonyl carbon, maybe an ester or anhydride carbonyl. Oh, wait, the anhydride would have two carbonyl groups. But in the 13C spectrum, there are only two peaks. That suggests that maybe the two carbonyls are equivalent. So perhaps the anhydride is cyclic and symmetrical. For example, a cyclic anhydride where the two carbonyl groups are in equivalent positions.

Wait, let's think about what a diacid with a cis-alkene would look like. Suppose the diacid is something like cis-butenedioic acid. When it dehydrates, it forms a cyclic anhydride. For example, if the diacid is maleic acid, which is a diacid with a trans double bond, but wait, the starting material has a cis alkene. So maybe it's
