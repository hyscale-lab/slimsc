Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states, and we're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, where each part represents the orbital angular momenta of the two electrons and their total.

Wait, so l1 and l2 are each 1, right? Because p orbitals have l=1. And the total angular momentum quantum numbers l and m are 2 and -1. 

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So each measurement would give -ħ for their respective z-components.

I remember that for angular momentum, the eigenvalue for L_z is mħ. So if we have l=1 for each electron, the possible m values for each are -1, 0, +1. So the possible eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

But wait, they're asking about both electrons having Lz = -ħ. So both m1 and m2 would be -1. That would make the total m = m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2. Because the total angular momentum m is the sum of the individual m's.

But the total state given has m = -1. Oh wait, that's the total m is -1, not -2. So if the total m is -1, how can both individual m's be -1? Because that would sum to -2, which doesn't match the given state's m of -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum L² and L_z. So when you have this state, any measurement involving L_z will give mħ = -ħ in this case.

But what about the individual m1 and m2? Since the state is a coupled state, it's a combination of the product states of the individual electrons. So for two electrons each with l=1, the possible total l's can be l=2,1,0. Because adding two angular momenta l1 and l2, you get possible l values from |l1-l2| to l1+l2. So 1+1=2, 1-1=0, so l can be 2,1,0.

In this case, the state is l=2 and m=-1. So we're looking at the state where the total angular momentum is 2 and m is -1.

Now, the possible ways to combine m1 and m2 to get m_total = m1 + m2 = -1. So possible pairs (m1, m2) are:

(-1, 0): because (-1) + 0 = -1,

(0, -1): same as above, but order swapped,

And (-2,1) but wait, no, because each m can only be -1, 0, +1 for l=1. So possible m1 and m2 each can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but wait. For each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible pairs that sum to -1 are:

(-1, 0): sum to -1,

(0, -1): same,

and (-2, 1) is not possible because m can't be -2 for each electron. So only two possibilities contribute: (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

So in the coupled state, the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of these product states. But what's the exact form? I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two l=1 states into l=2, m=-1 is given by some formula. Do I remember the expansion? Let me think. For l1=1 and l2=1, the state |l=2, m=-1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = m.

So for m=-1, m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible m1 and m2 pairs are:

m1=-1, m2=0,

m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state |2, -1> is a combination of these two product states.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each term is sqrt( ( (2(2+1) ) / ( (2+1)(2+2) ) ) ) )? Wait, I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe I can remember the general formula for the CG coefficients for adding two angular momenta.

Another approach: The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into l=2 are known. For m = 2:

Only possible as (1,1). For m=1: (1,0) and (0,1). For m=0: (-1,1), (0,0), (1,-1)? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when combining two l=1 states, the possible m values for the total state can be from 2 down to -2. So for each m, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

m=2: (1,1)

m=1: (1,0), (0,1)

m=0: (1,-1), (0,0), (-1, 1)

m=-1: (-1,0), (0,-1)

m=-2: (-1,-1)

So for m=-1, the possible terms are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these states would be the same for each, and the state |l=2, m=-1> is a linear combination of these two product states. Let me write this as:

|2, -1> = a |1, -1> |1, 0> + b |1, 0> |1, -1>

Wait, no. Wait, the first state is for the first electron,
