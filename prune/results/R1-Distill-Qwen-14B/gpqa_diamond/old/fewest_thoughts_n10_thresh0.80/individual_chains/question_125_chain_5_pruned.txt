Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's being asked. 

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential because it looks like the potential energy in Hooke's law. So the force is proportional to r, and it's the same in all directions, hence isotropic.

The question is asking for two things: the value of the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, let me think about the energy levels first. In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. I remember that the energy depends on the quantum numbers in each dimension. Wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels can be considered as a sum of the three one-dimensional oscillators. So the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Wait, no, more accurately, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total is the sum of all three.

But wait, I think the energy can also be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number. For a three-dimensional isotropic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. The energy is given by E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N is the sum of the three quantum numbers in each direction: N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each energy level corresponds to a certain N.

Wait, the ground state is when all n_x, n_y, n_z are zero. So N=0. The energy is (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. That's the ground state. The first excited state would be when N=1. So the energies go like (3/2 + n) ħω where n is 0,1,2,...

Wait no, because N can be 0,1,2,... and E = (
