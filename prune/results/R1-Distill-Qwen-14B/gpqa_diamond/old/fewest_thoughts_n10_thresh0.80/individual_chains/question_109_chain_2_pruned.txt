Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see if I can break it down step by step.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle affects the symmetry of the wavefunction when identical particles are involved. Oh wait, the system is NN, so they're identical particles, right?

The problem states that Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think—T is the isospin, S is the total spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So T equals S + L plus one, modulo 2. That means it's about the parity of these quantum numbers.

The initial state is 1S0. Breaking down the term symbol: 1S0. The general form is (2S+1)LJ. So here, 1 means 2S+1=1, so S=0. L is S, which is 0 (s orbital), and J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So X has parity -1. Now, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave isn't allowed, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to another state plus some particle emission. The options involve different angular momentum states for X. The options are:

A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s

Wait, I think each option is of the form initial -> final + X. So the initial is 1S0, and the final is some state, with X being the emitted particle (p, p, f, s? Maybe p stands for photon? Or perhaps for other particles. Wait, wait, X is a particle emitted, so in the options, the X is denoted by the lowercase letters: p, s, f, etc. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think, the options are like 1S0 goes to another state plus a particle X. So for example, option A is 1S0 emits to 7D1 and emits a p. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the notation, maybe I should look closer.

Wait, the term symbols in the options are of the form 7D1, 3S1, etc. So the numbers before the letter are the spectroscopic notation, where the first number is 2L+1. So 7D1: 7=2L+1 → L=3 (since 2*3+1=7?), wait no, wait 2L+1=7 → L=3. Because 2L+1=7 → L=3. So D corresponds to L=2? Wait, no, wait letters are L=0: S, 1:P, 2:D, 3:F, etc. So D is L=2. Wait, but if the first number is 7, that would imply 2L+1=7 → L=3. That can't be right because D is L=2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again: the term symbol is (2L+1)L J. So for example, 7D1: 7 is 2L+1 → L=(7-1)/2 = 3; D is L=2. That seems conflicting. Maybe the letter is the spectroscopic symbol, so D is L=2. So 7D would have 2L+1=7 → L=3. That doesn't match. So perhaps each term symbol in the options is (2S+1)LJ, but the letters are different, so 7D1 would be 2S+1=7 → S=3; L = D → L=2; J=1. Oh, right, because the letters are in spectroscopic notation where S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc.

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0: 1=2S+1 → S=0. So the initial state has spin 0, and orbital angular momentum L=0 (since S is 0, and the term is S, which is 0). The initial state has J=0.

Now, when the system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So X's parity is -1. The system's parity must
