Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, so what's the deal here? I think I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with EDTA, the concentration of the free metal ion is really low because the formation constant is so large. Because the K is big, the reaction favors the formation of the complex, which means most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, leaving very little free.

Let me think about the reaction. The Ca-EDTA complex would form like this: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant, K, is given by [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}). So K = 5e10 is a very large number, indicating a stable complex.

But wait, the solution contains the complex itself. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, I can write the expression:

K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

But wait, in a solution where the complex is already present, the dissociation would depend on the K. Let me think about the initial setup. The solution has 0.02 M of the complex. So, initially, [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-} would be zero? No, that can't be right because the complex can dissociate a bit.

So, when the complex dissociates, let's say the change is x. So:

[
