Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The problem describes a series of reactions involving different substances, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that has to do with the shapes of molecules and their symmetry elements.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the reactions step by step. The first reaction is solid A reacting with gas B in an 8:1 ratio to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Thirdly, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Lastly, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let me try to deduce each one.

Starting with the first reaction: A + 8 B â†’ C (bright red). Bright red product... Hmm, I'm trying to think of a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in such a high ratio to form a red product. Oh, maybe something like the synthesis of a metal sulfide or oxide? Wait, but 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur or another element.

Wait, another thought. If B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2, maybe. If A is a metal, perhaps. Let's say A is a metal, and B is Cl2. Then, 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with A would form a metal chloride. But what's a bright red product? Oh! I remember that when copper reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid and is heated, it forms copper sulfate, water, and sulfur dioxide. But that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the red product is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, not red. Chromium(VI) compounds are usually orange or yellow. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak). Or wait, another possibility: F could be H2SO4 (strong) and G could be something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, hydrolysis of a compound to give a metal and two acids. Oh! Maybe C is a salt of two different acids. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which when hydrolyzed gives NaOH (strong base, but in the reaction, A is formed. Hmm, not matching.)

Wait, another angle. If C is a sulfide, like a metal sulfide. When metal sulfides react with water, they usually produce H2S gas, but that's a weak acid. But the problem states that two different acids are formed. Hmm, maybe it's a more complex salt.

Wait, another approach: let's look at reaction D and B forming H, which is a solvent. D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. If B is Cl2, then D might be a gas like H2O? No, because H2O is a liquid. Or perhaps D is O2? If B is Cl2 and D is O2, then 1:1 would form something like ClO2? But I'm not sure if that's right.

Wait, another thought. D and B form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are things like ethanol, water, acetone, etc. But B is a gas, so maybe D is another gas. If B is Cl2, then D could be H2O, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, if B is O2, D might be another gas.

Hold on, perhaps B is Cl2. Let me think: if A reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2 to form C, which is bright red. What bright red solid is formed when a metal reacts with chlorine? Oh, perhaps it's a chromium compound. Wait, no, CrCl3 is green. Alternatively, maybe it's MnCl2, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product C is CuCl2, but that's blue. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a metal with Cl2. Let's think of another possibility.

Wait, think about the second reaction:
