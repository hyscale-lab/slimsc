Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in a certain decay process, two heavy nucleons of flavor A convert into two B's and emit two E and two V particles. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It also mentions that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some maximum value Q.

Now, there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the E particles' energy spectrum changes in this new scenario.

I remember that in radioactive decay, the energy spectrum of emitted particles depends on whether there are conservation laws involved. For instance, in beta decay, the electrons have a continuous spectrum because of the energy sharing between the electron and the antineutrino. But in some other decays, like alpha decay, the emitted alpha particles have discrete energies because the daughter nucleus is in a specific energy state.

Wait, but why does the spectrum change? Let me think about the original decay first. The E particles (maybe electrons or positrons) have a continuous spectrum. That suggests that their energies aren't fixed, implying that energy isn't entirely going into E's; some must be shared with other particles.

In the original reaction, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So for each E, maybe they carry off some energy, and the V's take the rest. If the E's have a continuous spectrum, that implies that the V's must also take away energy, so the E's can't have a fixed maximum. But wait, the endpoint is Q. So the maximum energy each E can have is Q. Hmm, perhaps when the V particles are emitted, they have some mass, which affects the maximum possible energy.

Wait, in the original case, the E particles' maximum energy would be determined by the available energy (Q value of the reaction) minus the rest masses of the other particles. Since the V particles are much lighter than A and B, maybe their rest mass is negligible, or perhaps they are photons (which are massless), but the question says E and V are much lighter.

Wait, no, the problem says that in the original decay, E and V are much lighter. So in that case, maybe V's are like pions or something with small mass compared to A and B. But in the variant, instead of two V's, it's one M, which is an exotic, massless particle. So M has zero mass.

In the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. Why? Because when you have multiple bodies emitting, the energy can be shared in different ways. For instance, each E could take some energy, and the V's take the rest. Since the Vs are light, their energy can vary, allowing the Es to have a range of energies. So the E's have a maximum energy when the Vs take as little as possible, perhaps when they are emitted in the same direction, but I'm not entirely sure.

In the variant, the reaction emits M instead of two V's. So the equation is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Now, M is massless and exotic. Wait, so M must be like a photon or something similar. But since it's a single particle emitted, that could affect the energy sharing.

Now, in the original decay, because you have two V particles, each E's energy can vary. If the Vs are emitted in such a way that their energies sum up to some value, the E's can take the remaining energy. Since there are two Vs, their energies can be distributed, leading to a continuous spectrum for E.

But in the variant, only one M is emitted. Since M is massless and presumably
