Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed. So that means the number density of stars is constant throughout space, right? Uniform distribution implies that stars aren't clustered anywhere; they're spread out evenly.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance—closer stars have larger parallaxes, farther ones have smaller. Remember, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So if a star is at a distance d (in parsecs), its parallax plx is 1/d. Wait, no, actually it's the other way around: plx = 1/d. So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1", a star at 2 parsecs has 0.5", and so on.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's say we're looking at a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are in that range?

Since the distribution is uniform, the number density of stars (n) is a constant. Let me think about the volume. The distance corresponding to a parallax plx is d = 1/plx parsecs. So the volume of a shell between d and d + dd would be the volume of a sphere minus the inner sphere. But wait, actually, for a thin shell, the volume is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the derivative with respect to r is 4πr² dr.

But since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. So let's express the volume in terms of parallax.

Substituting d = 1/plx into the volume formula, the shell volume in terms of d is 4π(1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). Hmm, wait, maybe I should do it step by step.

Let me define the range of parallax as from plx to plx + dplx. Each parallax corresponds to a distance d and d', where d = 1/plx and d' = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, but for small dplx, we can approximate d' ≈ d - (d² * dplx). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the range in distance and then relate that to parallax.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the number of stars in a given parallax range. Since the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume.

So for a given d, the volume element is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, that's correct. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dplx = - plx² dd.

So
