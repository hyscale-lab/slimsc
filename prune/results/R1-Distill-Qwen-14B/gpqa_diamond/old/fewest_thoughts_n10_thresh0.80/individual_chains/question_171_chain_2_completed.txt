Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in bromination of different substituents on a benzene ring. Substances 1 to 6 are all benzene derivatives, and when they react with excess bromine, each forms a monobromo derivative. We need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. That means from the one with the least para product to the most.

Wait, wait. Electrophilic substitution on benzene... the substituents can direct the incoming electrophile. Oh right, activating and deactivating groups. Activating groups (like OMe, NH2) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating (like NO2, COOH) are meta directors. But wait, some deactivating groups can be ortho/para directors if they're strong enough, but I think nitro is definitely meta.

So each substituent directs the bromine to certain positions. But the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction, meaning how much of the product is para-substituted. But wait, wait, in mono-substitution, the product can be a mix of ortho, meta, para. So the substituent's directing effect will influence where the bromine adds.

But wait, the substituents are already on the benzene ring, and the question is about substitution on the benzene. Wait no, no: the substituent is on the benzene ring, and bromine is adding as an electrophile. So each substituent on the benzene will direct the bromine to certain positions.

Wait, but the substituents are in the para or ortho positions relative to themselves. Wait no, the substituent is on the benzene, and the incoming Br+ will attack at ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the substituent.

Wait, no: when substituents are present, the incoming group adds in certain positions relative to the substituent. So for example, if the substituent is a strong activating group (like -NH2, -OCH3), it's an ortho/para director. So bromine will tend to add at ortho or para positions relative to the substituent.

But in this case, the substituent is attached to benzene, and the bromine is adding to form a new substituent on the same ring. So our substituents are the existing groups, and the question is about where the bromine adds—ortho, meta, or para to those groups.

Wait, but the question states that each undergoes an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, forming only one monobromo derivative. So each starting substance is a benzene ring with a substituent, and upon bromination, only one product is formed. But that seems a bit odd, because usually, you get a mixture unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that only a single position is available for substitution. For example, in para-substituted benzene, adding Br in the meta position relative to the substituent might be the only possible position. Or maybe the substituent is so strong that it only allows a single product.

Wait, but the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm. So perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible for bromination. Then, the substituent directs the bromine to a specific position, and that's the only product.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, if the substituent is a strong meta director, then bromine would add in the meta position relative to it. But in some cases, if the ring has multiple substituents, the position may be fixed. But in this problem, each compound is a benzene ring with a single substituent.

Wait, okay, so each compound is benzene with one substituent. Let's list them:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The substituent is methyl.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: Benzoyl ethyl ester? Wait no, wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So that's a benzene ring with an ester group: O=C-O- attached to benzene and ethyl. So the substituent is OCOCH2CH3.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's chlorobenzene.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid.

So each substituent is on the benzene ring. Now, when bromine is added as an electrophile, the substituent directs the bromine to certain positions.

First, the substituents' directing effects:

1) Methyl (CH3-) is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it is an ortho/para director.

2) OCOCH2CH3 (ester group): Esters are deactivating (due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl), so they are meta directors.

Wait, no, esters are meta directors? Wait, activating groups are ortho/para, deactivating can be meta or sometimes ortho/para if they're strong enough.

Wait, nitro groups are deactivating and meta directors. Carbonyl groups, like in ketones, are deactivating and meta directors. Esters are similar to ketones in this regard, because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing.

So for substituent 2, which is an ester, it's a meta director.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a substituent. It's a deactivating group (because of the electronegativity, but it's also ortho/para directing because of resonance. Wait, yes: substituents with lone pairs, like Cl, can donate electrons through resonance, making them ortho/para directors despite being deactivating (since they're deactivating because of inductive effect, but activating through resonance).

So Cl is ortho/para.

4) NO2: Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

5) C2H5: Ethyl group. Alkyl, activating, so ortho/para.

6) COOH: Carboxylic acid group. It's a strong deactivating group (due to the electronegative O and the withdrawal of electrons through resonance), and it's a meta director.

So for each substituent, the direction is:

1) CH3: o/p

2) OCOCH2CH3: m

3) Cl: o/p

4) NO2: m

5) C2H5: o/p

6) COOH: m

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So in each case, how much of the product is para-substituted relative to the substituent.

Wait, but wait. When you have a substituent, the bromine can add in various positions. If the substituent is o/p directing, then Br can add in ortho or para positions. But sometimes, para is more favorable. So the para fraction is the proportion of the product that's para.

Wait, but the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So maybe that's not the case. For example, if the substituent is such that the bromine can only add in one position. That would happen if the substituent is in a way that only one position is possible, perhaps due to steric hindrance or the substituent's directing effect making only one position major.

Wait, but in reality, most mono-substituted benzene rings with an o/p director would form a mixture of o and p Br products. However, sometimes the para isomer is more stable or favored, leading to a higher yield.

But the question states that each produces only one monobromo product. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the bromine can only add in one position. For example, if the substituent is in a position that blocks all other positions except one.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent must be in a position that only allows substitution in one specific spot. For example, if the substituent is in the para position of another substituent, but that's not the case here because each compound has only one substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each substituent and where the bromine adds.

The substituent's directing effect determines where the Br goes. So for each compound:

1) CH3 (toluene): o/p. So Br can add in ortho or para positions, leading to o and p isomers. But the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That doesn't make sense for toluene. Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait, maybe the substituent is such that the bromine can only add in one position. For example, if the substituent is meta to another substituent, but no, each has only one substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that the ring is so activated in a single position that only that position is possible. But that's not the usual case. For instance, if the substituent is a strong activating group, like NH2, but in that case, you'd get multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is so bulky that the ortho positions are blocked, so bromine can only add para. But most substituents aren't that bulky.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that only para is possible, due to steric reasons. For example, a very bulky group would lead the bromine to add in the para position because the ortho positions are too crowded. But that's more of a steric effect, not electronic.

But in the problem, perhaps it's assumed that the substituent directs the bromine to a specific position, and that the reaction forms a single product. So perhaps, for each substituent, the bromine can only add in one position.

Wait. Let me think again. If the substituent is a meta director, then bromine adds in meta. So the product is meta-substituted relative to the substituent. Wait, but the question is about the para-isomer. So perhaps we're considering the substituent as the reference point, and the bromine could be either ortho, meta, or para to it. But the substituent directs where the bromine goes.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in a position that makes the bromine add in the para position relative to the substituent. Or maybe the substituent is such that the bromine can only add in the para position.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me step back.

Each substance is a benzene ring with one substituent. When bromine (as an electrophile) adds, it substitutes in a position relative to the substituent.

The substituent's effect:

- If activating (o/p director): Br adds to o or p positions.

- If deactivating (m director): Br adds to m.

But wait, in some cases, a substituent may allow only one position due to ring structure. For example, if the substituent is in a position where only one possible position for Br is available. Like, if the substituent is in the para position of another substituent, but in our case, each has only one substituent.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the substituent is such that the ring is so symmetric that adding Br in any position would lead to the same product. But that's not the case unless the substituent is in a position of high symmetry.

Wait, no, for example, if substituent is para to another substituent, but in our case, each has only one substituent, so the ring is not symmetric.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about each substituent and decide whether the bromine adds para to it, or whether the substituent's directing effect leads to the para product being major.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, which is the position where Br is added, and how much is para.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in a position that, when Br adds in the para position, it produces the para-isomer relative to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent directs Br to a certain position, and that position is the para position relative to the substituent.

Wait, no. The substituent is on the benzene ring, and the Br adds in a position relative to it. So for example, substituent is in position 1. If Br adds in position 4, that's para to substituent. If it adds in position 2 or 6, that's ortho.

So each substituent directs Br to either ortho, meta, or para.

So for each substituent, the Br adds in a specific position relative to it.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, what's the percentage of Br adding in the para position.

Wait, but the problem says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in each case, Br can only add in one position, making that the only product. So each substituent directs Br to a single position, either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because substituents like methyl, ethyl, Cl are o/p directors, which would allow Br to add in both ortho and para positions. However, the problem states that only a single monobromo product is formed. So maybe in reality, the substituent is such that only one position is possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in a position that only allows one product. Let me think:

For substituent 1: CH3. If the substituent is in position 1, Br can add in positions 2 (ortho), 4 (para), or maybe 3 or 5 (meta, but CH3 is o/p director, so meta isn't favored). So CH3 would lead to Br adding in o and p positions.

But the question says only one product is formed, which suggests that for each substituent, Br can only add in one position. That must mean that for some substituents, only one position is possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the substituents are such that the ring is highly activated in one specific position, making only that position reactive. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is adding in the para position of the substituent, but the substituent's directing effect makes it so that only the para product is formed.

Wait, no. For example, a substituent that is a strong o/p director could lead to a major para product, but not necessarily 100%.

Wait, but the question says only one monobromo product is formed, so perhaps each substituent is such that the Br can only add in a single position. So for each substituent, based on its directing effect, the Br will add in a particular position, leading to only one product.

So for each substituent, which position does the Br add, and is it para to the substituent?

Wait, let's think:

1) CH3 (activating, o/p director): So Br can add in o or p. But the problem says only one product. So why is that?

Wait, perhaps for toluene, the para position is more favored. So the major product is para, but the question says only one is formed. Alternatively, perhaps some substituents only allow one position due to steric hindrance. For example, a bulky substituent like tert-butyl, but CH3 isn't that bulky. So maybe for CH3, Br adds only para.

Wait, but I don't think that's correct. I think methyl is small enough that both ortho and para substitution are possible. So perhaps the question's assumption is that each substituent only allows one major product, which is the para.

But in reality, for toluene, the para product is more favored than the ortho because of less steric hindrance. So the para isomer is major, but both are formed. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so perhaps in this case, the para isomer is the only product.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of each substituent:

1) CH3: o/p director. So if only one product forms, perhaps it's para. Or maybe it's ortho. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's position is such that only one substitution is possible. For example, if the substituent is in the position that makes the para position the only available. But in a benzene ring, each substituent has symmetric positions. So substituent in position 1, Br can go to 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, but the substituent is a single group, so symmetrical positions should be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps for each substituent, the para product is the major one, but the question says that only one is formed. So maybe the substituent is such that the para position is the only possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in a position that allows only the para substitution. But that doesn't make much sense because the substituent is on the ring, and substitution is relative.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of each substituent and whether it's meta or ortho/para director, and then determine where the Br adds, and whether it's para.

1) CH3: o/p director. So Br can add in ortho or para. But the problem states only one product. So maybe the para is the only product.

Wait, but that's not true. In reality, toluene bromination gives a mixture, but the para is more favored. But the question says only one product is formed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the ring is so activated in only one position, making that the only possible substitution. For example, substituents like -NH2 are strong activating, so the ortho and para positions are activated, but perhaps in some cases, only one is possible.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So we need to arrange the substituents based on how much of the product is para.

But each substituent may only produce para or meta. Wait, if the substituent is a meta director, then the Br adds in meta, which would make the para-isomer zero. Similarly, if the substituent is an o/p director, the Br adds in ortho and para, so the para fraction is the proportion of para product.

Wait, but the problem states that only one monobromo product is formed, which suggests that for each substituent, the Br adds in a single position, either ortho, meta, or para.

So for each substituent, determine whether the Br adds in ortho, meta, or para, which would determine the para fraction.

If the substituent is meta director, then Br adds in meta, so the para fraction is zero.

If the substituent is o/p director, does Br add in ortho or para, or both? But according to the question, only one product is formed. So perhaps for o/p directors, the Br adds only in para, making the para fraction 100%.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. For example, in toluene, the para product is major but not exclusive. However, the problem says only one product is formed, so perhaps in this scenario, we must assume that each substituent produces only the product that corresponds to the most favorable position.

So, for substituents with o/p directing, Br adds in para position (assuming para is the major product, perhaps due to less steric hindrance).

Wait, but I've read that para is more favorable because it has less steric hindrance than ortho. So for o/p directors, the para is the major product, but in some cases, like when the substituent is bulky, the ortho may not form, and only para forms.

So, if the substituent is o/p director, then the para fraction is high, perhaps 100% if only one product is formed.

So for each substituent, the para fraction is:

Substituent 1: CH3 (o/p) → para product is major → para fraction is high (say 100% as per the question).

Substituent 2: OCOCH2CH3 (meta director) → Br adds in meta → para fraction is 0.

Substituent 3: Cl (o/p) → Br adds para → para fraction is high.

Substituent 4: NO2 (meta) → Br adds meta → para fraction 0.

Substituent 5: C2H5 (o/p) → Br adds para → high.

Substituent 6: COOH (meta) → Br adds meta → para fraction 0.

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is o/p. So Br adds in ortho and para. But according to the question, only one product is formed. So perhaps in this case, the para is the only product because of steric reasons, making the para fraction 100%.

Similarly for substituent 1 and 5 (CH3 and C2H5), which are o/p. So para fraction is 100%.

Substituent 2,4,6: meta directors. So Br adds in meta → para fraction is 0.

Wait, but this would mean that substituents 2,4,6 have a para fraction of 0. So their order in terms of increasing para fraction would be 0.

But the question is about arranging them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the substituents with 0% para would come first, then those with 100%, but the options don't seem to match that.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer options are all different sequences.

Wait, but maybe substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para, and 1,3,5 have 100% para, which would make the order 2,4,6 <1,3,5. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. For substituents that are o/p directors (1,3,5), the para product is a major product but not necessarily the only one. However, the question states that only one monobromo product is formed. So perhaps each substituent leads to Br adding in a single position, either para or meta.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if the substituent is o/p, then Br can add in both ortho and para. But the problem says only one product is formed, which suggests that each substituent directs Br to a single position.

So perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible, either ortho or para. But how?

Wait, maybe the substituent is in a position that only allows substitution in one specific spot. For example, substituent in position 1, and the Br can only add in position 4 (para), because the ortho positions (2 and 6) are blocked by something. But in the given compounds, there's only one substituent, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the para position is the only possible. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in a position that makes the para position the only possible due to ring symmetry.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of each substituent's product and arrange them according to their para fractions.

Let's list the substituents:

1) CH3: o/p → Br can add at o and p. So if only one product is formed, perhaps it's para (so para fraction is 100%).

2) OCOCH2CH3: meta → Br adds at meta, so para fraction 0.

3) Cl: o/p → para is major, so assuming only para (100%).

4) NO2: meta → para fraction 0.

5) C2H5: o/p → para is major, so 100%.

6) COOH: meta → para fraction 0.

So the substituents with 100% para are 1,3,5. Those with 0% are 2,4,6.

Now, the question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

So the order would be substituents with lower para fractions first.

So 2,4,6 have 0% → then 1,3,5 have 100%.

But the options don't have this. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5

B)6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3

C)4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3

D)3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4

Wait, none of the options have 2,4,6 first. So perhaps my assumption that substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps some substituents which are o/p directors don't have 100% para, but a certain percentage.

Wait, maybe for substituents that are o/p directors, the para fraction varies. For example, some substituents may direct more to para than others.

Wait, but the question says each forms only one monobromo product. So perhaps for each substituent, the para fraction is 100% or 0%.

Wait, but in reality, substituents like -Cl are o/p, but the para product is more favored. So perhaps in this scenario, substituents that are o/p directors have higher para fractions, but not 100%.

But the problem says only one product is formed, so perhaps each substituent leads to only one product: either meta or para.

Wait, perhaps substituents that are meta directors lead to meta products, so 0% para.

Substituents that are o/p directors lead to para products, so 100% para.

But in that case, substituents 1,3,5 have 100% para, and 2,4,6 have 0%.

So when arranging in order of increasing para fraction, the order would be 2,4,6 <1,3,5.

But the options don't have that. The options have more detailed orderings.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that all o/p directors lead to 100% para. Maybe some substituents have a more selective directing effect.

Wait, perhaps substituents that are strong o/p directors favor para more than others. For example, substituent 3 is Cl, which is a weaker activating group than CH3 or C2H5. So perhaps Cl directs more to ortho than para.

Wait, but that's not the case. I've read that Cl is ortho/para directing, but in practice, para is the major product because of steric reasons. So Cl would have a higher para fraction than methyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. In nitration of chlorobenzene, the para product is major, but some ortho is formed. Similarly, in toluene, the para is major.

So perhaps the para fractions are:

Substituent 1 (CH3): high para fraction.

Substituent 3 (Cl): also high para.

Substituent 5 (C2H5): high para.

But perhaps the order depends on how strong the activating effect is. For example, stronger activating groups (like -NH2) lead to more para product.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the order is based on how selective the substituent is in directing to para.

Alternatively, perhaps substituents that are more strongly activating have a higher percentage of para product.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring determines how much para product is formed.

Wait, but in any case, the substituents 2,4,6 are all meta directors, so their para fractions are zero. Substituents 1,3,5 are o/p, with varying para fractions.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the order from least to greatest would be substituents with 0% first, then those with higher percentages.

But the options don't have such an arrangement. Looking at the options:

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5

So substituents 4,2,6 have lower para fractions than 3,1,5.

But substituents 4,2,6 are all meta directors (so 0% para), and 3,1,5 are o/p directors (so maybe higher para fractions).

But this would imply that 4 has lower para than 2, which has lower than 6, which doesn't make sense because 4,2,6 all are meta.

So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about para relative to the substituent, but about the position of the substituent in the product. Hmm, that would complicate things. Wait, no, the substituent is on the benzene, and the bromine is adding another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in the para position relative to the bromine. But in that case, the substituent's position would determine the para fraction.

Wait, no, the substituent is already on the ring, and the bromine is adding another substituent. The question is about the position of the bromine relative to the existing substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position in the molecule affects the availability of positions for substitution. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes the para position to itself the same as the substituent's position, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in such a position that the para position is the same as itself. No, that's not possible unless it's a di-substituted benzene.

But each compound is mono-substituted.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider the possibility that some substituents lead to the para product being the major product, while others may have a lower percentage of para.

Wait, another approach: in some cases, the substituent is such that the para position is not available. For example, if the substituent is meta, then bromine adds in meta, so the substituent is in the meta position relative to itself, which would make the para product.

Wait, no, that's not correct. If the substituent is in position 1, and Br adds in position 3 (meta), then the bromine is meta to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the substituent's position in the molecule. For example, the substituent could be in the para position relative to another substituent, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the bromine can only add in the para position relative to itself.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each substituent and determine where the bromine adds.

For substituent 1: CH3. Bromine can add in ortho or para. If only one product forms, perhaps para is the only product. So para fraction is 100%.

Substituent 2: ester. Ester is meta director, so Br adds meta. Para fraction 0.

Substituent 3: Cl. o/p director. So Br can add in ortho or para. If only one product forms, perhaps para is the only product. Para fraction 100%.

Substituent 4: NO2. meta director. Br adds meta. Para fraction 0.

Substituent 5: C2H5. o/p director. Br adds para. Para fraction 100%.

Substituent 6: COOH. meta director. Br adds meta. Para fraction 0.

So substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para; 1,3,5 have 100%. So their order would be 2,4,6 < substituents 1,3,5.

But the options don't have this. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5

So substituents 4,2,6 have lower para fractions than 3,1,5.

But 4,2,6 are meta directors, so their para fraction is 0. So substituents 3,1,5 have higher para fractions.

But in option A, substituent 3 comes after 6, which contradicts because 3 has higher (100%) than 6 (0%).

So this can't be correct.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3

Substituents 6,2,4 are meta directors (0% para), 5,1,3 are o/p (100% para). So this would arrange them as 6 (0)<2(0)<4(0)<5(100%)<1(100%)<3(100%). But the option lists 5 after 4, which is correct. But why would 5 be before 1 and 3?

Alternatively, perhaps within the o/p directors, the substituents have different para fractions. For example, substituent 5 (C2H5) may have a lower para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3).

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction depends on the substituent's activating strength. Stronger activating groups (like -NH2) would direct more to para.

So perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is less activating than CH3 and C2H5. So Cl directs more to ortho, leading to a lower para fraction.

Wait, but I thought Cl is o/p and para is major. So perhaps substituent 1 (CH3) has higher para than 3 (Cl), which has higher than 5 (C2H5). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the activating effect of substituents can vary. For example, -OCH3 is a stronger activating group than -CH3. So perhaps substituents with stronger activating effects have higher para fractions.

Wait, but substituent 1 is CH3 (activating), 3 is Cl (activating, but deactivating via inductive effect), 5 is C2H5 (activating). So Cl is not as strongly activating as CH3 or C2H5.

So perhaps substituent 5 (C2H5) is a stronger activating group than Cl. So perhaps substituent 5 has a higher para fraction than Cl.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: the para fraction may depend on the substituent's ability to direct. For example, substituents that are more strongly activating may have a higher percentage of para product.

So, substituent 5 (C2H5) is more activating than substituent 1 (CH3)? No, I think CH3 is a stronger activating group than C2H5. Because methyl is smaller and more activating.

Wait, perhaps the order of activating strength is:

–NH2 > –OCH3 > –CH3 > –C2H5 > ... 

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the activating effect increases with the size of the substituent. But I think -CH3 is a stronger activating group than -C2H5, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the activating effect of substituents correlates with their ability to donate electrons. So, the more they donate, the more activating. So –CH3 is more activating than –C2H5 because it's smaller and has more +I effect.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, this line of thinking may not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. The problem asks to arrange the substituents in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the substituent with the smallest para fraction comes first, followed by those with larger fractions.

Given that substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, their para fractions are 0. So they come first. Then the o/p directors come next, with their para fractions.

Now, among the o/p directors (1,3,5), which have higher para fractions? Let's think about their activating strength.

Substituent 1: CH3 (methyl) is an activating group. 

Substituent 3: Cl (chlorine) is a deactivating group because of its electronegativity, but it's ortho/para directing due to resonance.

Substituent 5: C2H5 (ethyl) is an activating group, like CH3.

Wait, but Cl is a deactivating group (overall), but it's still o/p directing.

So substituents 1 and 5 are activating (strong o/p directors), while substituent 3 is a deactivating but o/p director.

So the para fraction for substituent 1 and 5 would be higher than substituent 3. Because their activating effect makes the para position more favored.

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group. So the ring is less reactive, but Cl is o/p director. So the para product is formed, but perhaps in lower amounts compared to activating groups.

So the para fractions would be: substituent 1 (CH3) > substituent 5 (C2H5) > substituent 3 (Cl).

Wait, but all three are o/p directors, so their para fractions are 100% as per the problem's condition.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is based on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state for para substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's position affects the possibility of adding bromine in the para position. For example, substituent in position 1, bromine can add in position 4 (para), but if the substituent is in position 2, bromine adds in position 5 (which is para to substituent 2).

But in all cases, each substituent is in a single position, so the bromine can add in para position.

Wait, perhaps I should list each substituent and their impact on para fraction.

Substituent | Director | Para fraction
--- | --- | ---
1 | o/p | 100%
2 | meta | 0%
3 | o/p | 100%
4 | meta | 0%
5 | o/p | 100%
6 | meta | 0%

But according to the options, substituents 2,4,6 are lower in the order.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the substituents are arranged based on their ability to form the para product. So substituents that are meta directors have 0% para, and those o/p directors have higher.

So the order would be substituents with 0% first, then those with 100%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's position affects the ease of para substitution. For example, substituents that are in positions that make the para position more or less accessible.

Wait, but each substituent is in a single position, and the benzene ring is symmetric. So substituent position doesn't affect substitution positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's own position (e.g., being in a para position relative to another substituent) is causing a ring effect. But each has only one substituent.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the answer options.

Looking at the options, the correct order should have meta directors (substituents 2,4,6) with lower para fractions than o/p directors (1,3,5).

So the order would be meta directors < o/p directors.

Which option follows this?

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5

But substituents 4,2,6 are meta, and 3,1,5 are o/p.

But according to our earlier analysis, substituents 3 is o/p, but perhaps it has a lower para fraction than 1 and 5.

So within o/p directors, substituents 3 has lower para fraction than 1 and 5.

Thus, the order would be 4,2,6 <3 <1,5.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than 1 and 5.

Because Cl is a deactivating group (so less activating than CH3 or C2H5), the para fraction could be lower. So substituent 3 has lower para fraction than 1 and 5.

So the order would be:

2,4,6 (0%) <3 (say 50%) <1,5 (100%).

But the problem states only one product is formed, so perhaps substituent 3 has 100% para.

But if that's the case, then all o/p directors have 100% para.

But this isn't helping. Let me think of the options again.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3

So substituents 4,6,2 (all meta) have lower than 1,5,3.

But substituents 1,5,3 are o/p directors.

But according to this option, substituent 1 comes before 5, which comes before 3.

But why would 1 have lower para than 5? Maybe because CH3 is a stronger activating group than C2H5, leading to higher para fraction for 1 than 5.

Wait, perhaps the para fraction is inversely related to the substituent's activating strength. No, stronger activating groups should lead to more para products.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction depends on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state, with larger groups leading to more para substitution.

But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the substituents:

- Substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para fraction is 0.

- Substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors, so their para fraction is 100%.

So the order from least to greatest para fraction would be: substituents 2,4,6 < substituents 1,3,5.

Looking at the options, none of them have this exact order. But let's look at option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But substituents 4,2,6 are meta, so they come first, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But according to our analysis, 3,1,5 are o/p directors, so they should have higher para fractions than 2,4,6.

So the option A would place 3,1,5 after 4,2,6, which aligns with them having higher para fractions. So substituent 3 is after 6, which is a meta director.

But substituent 3 is an o/p director, so it should have a higher para fraction than 6. So in the order, substituent 3 should come after the meta directors.

So option A's order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Which would have meta directors (4,2,6) first, then o/p directors (3,1,5).

But why is substituent 3 after 6?

Ah, perhaps because substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5). So within the o/p directors, substituent 3 has a lower para fraction than 1 and 5.

So the order would be substituent 3 has lower than 1 and 5. So the order among o/p directors is 3 <1 <5.

So the overall order is:

meta directors 4,2,6 (0% para) < o/p directors 3,1,5 (each 100% but ordered as 3 <1 <5).

So the full order would be: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Which is option A.

But wait, why would substituent 3 have a lower para fraction than 1 and 5? Because Cl is a deactivating group, so it's less activating than CH3 and C2H5, which are activating. So perhaps for substituent 3, the para fraction is lower than for 1 and 5.

Wait, but the problem states that only one product is formed. So perhaps for substituent 3, the para product is the only product, making its para fraction 100%. But then, why would it come before substituents 1 and 5 in the order?

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else. Perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects how easily the para product is formed. For example, stronger activators (like CH3) lead to para products being formed more quickly, so higher para fractions.

But according to the problem, each reaction only forms one product, so perhaps the substituent with stronger activating effect leads to a higher rate of para substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's own position affects the possibility of para substitution. For example, substituent in position 1 may have para at 4, but substituent in position 2 would have para at 5.

But I'm not sure.

I think I've spent too much time on this and should pick the option that makes sense. Based on the analysis, substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para, and 1,3,5 have 100% para. But in the options, only option A has the meta directors first, followed by o/p directors. But why would substituent 3 (Cl) come before 1 and 5?

Perhaps because Cl is a deactivating group, so the para fraction is lower than for activating groups. But in that case, substituent 3's para fraction would be lower than 1 and 5. So the order would be 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, which is option A.


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in the bromination of the given benzene derivatives, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents:

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **CH3 (Methyl)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing. Bromine adds predominantly in the para position due to reduced steric hindrance compared to the ortho positions.
2. **COOCH2CH3 (Ester)**: Deactivating, meta-directing. Bromine adds in the meta position, resulting in a para fraction of 0.
3. **Cl (Chlorine)**: Weakly deactivating (due to inductive effect), but ortho/para-directing (due to resonance). Bromine adds predominantly in the para position.
4. **NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. Bromine adds in the meta position, resulting in a para fraction of 0.
5. **C2H5 (Ethyl)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing. Bromine adds predominantly in the para position.
6. **COOH (Carboxylic Acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. Bromine adds in the meta position, resulting in a para fraction of 0.

### Para Fraction of Each Substituent:
- **Substituents 2, 4, 6**: Meta-directing groups. Para fraction = 0.
- **Substituents 1, 3, 5**: Ortho/para-directing groups. Para fraction = 100%.

### Ordering by Increasing Para Fraction:
Substituents with 0% para fraction (meta directors) come first, followed by substituents with 100% para fraction (ortho/para directors). Among the ortho/para directors, substituents are ordered based on their relative activating effects:
- **Cl (Substituent 3)**: A weaker activating group compared to CH3 and C2H5, leading to a slightly lower para fraction.
- **CH3 (Substituent 1)**: Stronger activating group than Cl, leading to a higher para fraction.
- **C2H5 (Substituent 5)**: Strongest activating group, leading to the highest para fraction.

Thus, the order is: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
