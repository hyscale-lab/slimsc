Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in different monobrominated derivatives. We have six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to a different substituent. They all undergo a bromination reaction with excess bromine. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can either activate or deactivate the ring towards electrophilic attack. Also, substituents can direct incoming electrophiles to specific positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para.

So for each substituent, I need to figure out its directing effect. Let's list them out:

1. C6H5-CH3: This is a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's electron-donating (via the inductive effect, but wait, isn't methyl donating through sigma bonds? Oh right, as a activating group, it donates electrons, making the ring more reactive. So methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent.

2. C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzyloxy group, so it's an ester substituent. Wait, no, wait. The structure is C6H5-COO-C2H5. So the substituent is a benzoyloxy group? Or wait, no. Wait, COOEt, so it's an ester group. So, the substituent is an ester. Wait, no, wait: the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Or is it C6H5-O-CO-C2H5? No, the formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. So it's a phenyl group connected to a carbonyl group, then an O, then ethyl. So, the substituent is an acetyloxy group? Wait, no. Let me think. The group is O-CO-OEt? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is R-O-CO-R'? No, wait. The substituent is -O-CO-OEt? No, maybe I got it wrong. Wait, the substituent is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Because the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Wait, no, the substituent is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? No, the substituent is the entire group attached to benzene. So it's benzyl acetate? No, wait. The substituent is a benzoyloxy group? Or maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -COOEt (ethyl ester), but attached where? Wait, the benzene is attached to a carbonyl group, then an O, then ethyl. So the substituent is a phenyl group attached via a carbonyl to an oxygen, which is then attached to ethyl. Wait, that's maybe a bit unclear, but I think the substituent is a carbonyl group connected to an oxygen and then an ethyl group. So the substituent is -COOEt. So, what is the nature of that group? The -COOEt group is an ester, so it's an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, so the ester group is meta-directing, and deactivating. Because the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it deactivates the ring, making it less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. Also, being a meta director, electrophiles enter at the meta position relative to the substituent.

3. C6H5-Cl: So this is a chlorobenzene. Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's a halogen, so it's an electron-withdrawing group via induction (since Cl has higher electronegativity), but it's also ortho/para-directing because of its lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance. So even though it deactivates the ring (because of the -I effect), the +R effect (resonance) can direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para director.

4. C6H5-NO2: This is nitrobenzene. Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Because the nitro group is highly electron-withdrawing, it makes the ring less reactive. It directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.

5. C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. Ethyl is an alkyl group, which is electron-donating via the inductive effect (since it's an activating group). So ethyl is activating and ortho/para-directing.

6. C6H5-COOH: This is benzoic acid. The COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group due to the two electronegative oxygens. It's deactivating. The -COOH group is meta-directing because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So the substituent is meta-directing.

Wait, no. Wait, for substituents like -COOH, are they meta or para directors? I think that the -COOH is a strong deactivating (EWG) group and is meta-directing. Because the EWG effect dominates, so the substituent directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.

So now, the next thing is that when a substituent is ortho/para-directing, the incoming electrophile can attack at both ortho and para positions, so the major products would be a mixture of ortho, para, and maybe some meta if there's steric hindrance or other factors. But for meta-directing groups, the electrophile will attack mainly at the meta positions.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So we need to find for each substituent, what's the percentage of para product formed.

But wait, for substituents that are meta-directing, the para product would be minimal, because the directing is towards meta. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Wait, substituents can be ortho/para (activating or deactivating) or meta (deactivating). So for an ortho/para director, the major products are the ortho and para isomers. For meta directors, the major product is the meta isomer.

So, for each substituent, the percentage of para product depends on the substituent's directing effect.

So to find the yield of the para-isomer, let's think about each substituent:

1. Methyl (CH3): Ortho/para director. So the para is a major product. But wait, in benzene with a substituent that is ortho/para directing, the para product can be a major part, but it's not the only product. Additionally, the substituent's activating or deactivating nature can influence the reactivity, but in this case, the question is about the position, so the substituent's directing effect is the key.

But wait, when a substituent is ortho/para directing, the major products are ortho and para. So, for each substituent, we need to determine the relative amounts of para isomer.

Wait, but for some substituents, the para product might be more favored than the ortho due to steric hindrance. For example, bulky groups tend to have more para product because the ortho positions are more crowded.

So, for substituent 1 (methyl): It's a small substituent, so the ortho positions are less hindered. So in this case, the para product might be less favored than the ortho. I think for methyl group, the para isomer is usually less than the ortho. Wait, but wait, in toluene bromination, the major product is para, but wait no, I think it's more ortho. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the substituent's effect on the directing and activation, and how that affects the relative amounts of para product.

So:

1. CH3: activating, ortho/para. The major products are ortho and para, but because the ortho positions are more crowded (for small substit
