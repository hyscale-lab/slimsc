Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, so the situation is that there's a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows something a bit off. The spectrum looks right except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each must be about half, maybe. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so they aren't splitting each other.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temp, there are two peaks with equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So, the mass is the same, hence same molecular weight. But why two peaks?

Let me think about possible explanations. The first thing that comes to mind is that maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. If it's a mixture of enantiomers, then in the NMR, each enantiomer would have the same chemical shifts because they're mirror images. But wait, in that case, for an alpha-proton, if it's in a chiral center, each enantiomer's proton would be in a different environment. Oh wait, but if the proton is in the same environment in each enantiomer, maybe they would have the same shift. Wait, no. For a chiral center, the alpha protons would be in different environments if they're not equivalent. But if the molecule is symmetrical, maybe those protons are equivalent. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. If it's enantiomers, the shifts would be the same, right? Because enantiomers are mirror images, so the environment around the protons would be the same. So if the alpha protons are in a chiral center, but the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps they are equivalent. That could cause two separate peaks because of the two enantiomers, but wait, wouldn't the NMR see them as a single peak because they're identical in that aspect? Because when you have an enantiomer, the NMR doesn't distinguish between them unless the sample is chiral and has a chiral environment. Wait, no, because the NMR doesn't differentiate between enantiomers; they would cause the same peaks. So, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same peaks as a pure sample. So that might not explain the two peaks in the NMR. Hmm, so maybe B is not the answer.

Another option is that it's a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including NMR shifts. So, if the compound is a diastereomeric mix, each diastereomer would have different NMR shifts. But wait, in the question, the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So, maybe they're diastereomers but with very similar shifts, perhaps due to being close in structure. But then, why would the integrals add up to 1H? Because each diastereomer contributes a peak, each integrating to about 0.5H, maybe. Or perhaps each has an alpha proton in a different environment, but the shifts are close. So, in the NMR, you'd see two separate peaks for the same proton in each isomer. That could fit the scenario. So D is a possibility.

Option C says 'double coupling' during an amide bond formation. I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it refers to some coupling where two bonds form, leading to some isomeric forms. Like, perhaps, in an amide coupling, if there's some sort of tautomerism or different regiochemistry? Or maybe it's about the formation of two different diastereomers during the coupling, leading to different products. Hmm, but I'm not certain. I might have to think more about this.

Option A suggests contamination with a precursor. If there's a precursor, it would have a different molecular weight. But the LC-MS shows both peaks have the same mass. So, the same molecular weight as
