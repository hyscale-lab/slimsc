Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question has two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with water) to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, what usually happens? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, the nitrile group would add to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in the product, I see a hydroxyl group. Oh, right! Maybe it's some kind of addition followed by a substitution or another reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with CN- in a basic medium. The mechanism involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, then protonation, and then perhaps some tautomerism or another step. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has both an OH and a CN group on the same carbon.

So, the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. To form a cyanohydrin, the ketone reacts with a nitrile source like NaCN, but under what conditions? I think the reaction typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. Like H3O+ or H2SO4. So, in this case, reagent A would be H3O+.

So, looking at the options, for A, options A and B have H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3. So, the first part of the reaction (reagent A) is probably H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (but wait, no, in the second reaction, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, it's a nitrile with a substituted group and a hydroxyl on the same carbon.

The product is a butanoic acid derivative, specifically 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? Well, the typical process involves several steps. One common method is hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. But wait, in this case, the starting material has both a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. I'm thinking maybe it's
