Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's go through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data.

First, let's read the problem again. The chemist found a white solid and ran some tests: mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR. The options are four different compounds. I need to analyze each of the spectroscopic data and match it to the correct structure.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest, so that's the molecular weight. Additionally, there's a peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, that's interesting. The molecular weight is 156, but a fragment is at 158? Wait, that's heavier. Maybe it's an isotope peak or a fragment with an added something like a Cl? Or perhaps a double bond or something else. Wait, the molecular ion is usually the highest, but sometimes there can be fragments. Oh, but waitâ€”158 is two more than 156. Maybe it's something like a Cl isotope? Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and 25% for 37Cl. So when a molecule has a Cl atom, the molecular ion peak would have two peaks: one at m/z (M) and another at M+2. Let me calculate: if the molecular weight (M) is 156, then M+2 would be 158. So the ratio is 100% for M and 32% for M+2. Wait, but usually the Cl isotope would be around 75% and 25% for the two isotopes, but here the M is 100%, and the M+2 is 32%, which is about 43% of the M peak. Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. Unless perhaps the molecular formula includes Cl or another element with a higher isotope abundance. Wait, maybe the molecule has two Cl atoms? Then the M peak would be lower because the isotopic pattern would have more peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the M is 156, and the 158 is not a fragment but a doubly charged ion? Or maybe it's a different kind of peak. Alternatively, the M is 156, and the 158 is a fragment that lost something. Wait, let's think about the molecular formula.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl (35.5) and another O (since 2-hydroxy would add another O). Wait, benzaldehyde is C7H6O, and if it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, that's C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is (12*7) + (5*1) +35.5 + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, so approximately 156.5, which rounds to 156 as the molecular ion. The M+2 would be 158.5, but the peaks are at 156 and 158. So the 32% at 158 makes sense as the Cl isotope. Because the major isotope of Cl is 35Cl at 75%, and 37Cl at 25%. So the molecular ion would be a peak at 156 (35Cl), and 158 (37Cl). The ratio would be 75% for 156, and 25% for 158. But in the data, the molecular ion is at 10
