Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but their observing capacities are different.

First, let me look at the information given. The ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So stars with apparent V magnitude ≤17, because brighter means lower magnitude. Oh right, because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag.

HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag. Because anything brighter (smaller mag) than 16.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the question says: for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag. So brighter than 17 means m_V <17, so they can see stars down to 17 mag? Or up to 17 mag? Wait, brightness is inversely related to magnitude. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a star with m_V = 17 is dimmer than one with 16. So if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, that would mean m ≤17. Because if a star is brighter than 17, its magnitude is less than 17. So maximum apparent magnitude that ESPRESSO can detect is 17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So their maximum apparent magnitude is 16. So HIRES can see brighter (lower mag) stars than ESPRESSO. Wait, no. Wait, because 16 is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can go up to 17, while HIRES goes up to 16. So a star that is brighter than 16 would be observable by both, because if m_v is 15, both can see it. But a star with m_v =16.5 would be too faint for HIRES (since HIRES can go up to 16
