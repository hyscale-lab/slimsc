Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for a given electron spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? So I guess it's a two-level system, like spin-up and spin-down states. The components must be in the order of the eigenstates of some operator, probably the Pauli matrices. Oh, right, for spin-1/2 particles, the spin states are usually represented with two components, each corresponding to the eigenvalues ±ℏ/2.

The question is about the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state multiplied by the operator, and then multiplied by the state (ket). So, in formula terms, it's ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator.

Wait, the operator here is S_y. Oh, right, the Pauli matrices are related to the spin operators. The spin operator S along a direction is given by (ℏ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, and S_y would be (ℏ/2)σ_y.

The given σ_y matrix is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y is (ℏ/2) multiplied by this matrix. Let me write that out.

So S_y = (ℏ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The state vector is given as ψ = (3i, 4). Wait, but typically, the spin states are written as column vectors. So ψ is a column vector with first component 3i and second component 4. So ψ = [3i; 4].

Wait, but wait a second. When you take the expectation value, you need to compute ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ† would be [ -3 (since 3i conjugate is -3) , 4 ].

Wait, actually, no, wait. Let me correct that. The components are (3i,4). The conjugate would be (-3i,4), right? Because the conjugate of 3i is -3i and
