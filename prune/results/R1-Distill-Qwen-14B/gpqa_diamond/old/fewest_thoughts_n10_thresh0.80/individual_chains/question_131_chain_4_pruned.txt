Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the question describes a series of reactions and the resulting products. Let me start by understanding each part.

The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dicarboxylic acids have two carboxylic acid groups. When they dehydrate, they form an anhydride. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride because two carboxylic acid groups lose water and bond together.

The anhydride formed has some specific NMR data. Its 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which usually corresponds to aromatic protons. But wait, anhydrides aren't typically aromatic unless there's conjugation or ring structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with some double bonds affecting the protons. So perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure, like a cyclic di-anhydride.

Looking at the 13C NMR: two peaks, one at 137 ppm and another at 165 ppm. 137 is likely a spÂ² carbon, maybe part of a double bond. The 165 ppm is probably a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone or ester. But wait, anhydrides have carbonyl groups around 170-185 ppm. Oh, wait, maybe the 165 is a carbonyl from an anhydride. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic anhydride with some conjugation. Hmm.

Wait, if the anhydride is formed from a cis-alkene, perhaps the dehydration leads to a bicyclic structure or a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a maleic anhydride type structure. Wait, maleic anhydride has two double bonds, one in the anhydride and another from the starting diene.

Wait, but the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. So maybe all the protons are equivalent. So perhaps it's a symmetrical anhydride, like a five-membered ring where the two substituents are the same. Like a cyclic anhydride where the two carbonyl groups are across from each other.

Let me think about the structure. A cis-alkene in the dicarboxylic acid would, upon dehydration, form an anhydride that has a conjugated double bond. For example, if the acid was (Z)-butenedioic acid, then dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. Wait, but the anhydride has a single peak in H NMR at 7 ppm, which suggests all protons are equivalent. Maybe it's a structure where the protons are all the same, like a cyclic structure where the protons are in equivalent environments.

Wait, another thought: if the anhydride is symmetrical, like a five-membered ring with
