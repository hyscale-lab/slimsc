Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Wait, p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l equal to 1, right? Each electron has l=1 because p orbitals are l=1. So the state of the system is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Let me parse this. I think the notation is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and M is its z-component. 

The problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum, so we're only dealing with the orbital part here. We need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is measured, and we want the probability that both are -ħ.

Let me think about the state |1,1,2,-1>. Since the total orbital angular momentum quantum number L is 2, and M is -1.

Wait, but each electron has l=1, so the possible L values when combining two l=1 particles are L = |l1-l2| to l1+l2. So that would be L=0,1,2. In this case, the state is L=2, M=-1.

The state is a coupled angular momentum state, meaning it's expressed in terms of the total L. I remember that when dealing with angular momentum coupling, the states can be expressed as combinations of the individual states. 

I think the state |L, M> is a linear combination of states |l1, m1> |l2, m2> where m1 + m2 = M. So for L=2 and M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 combinations that sum to -1 are:

m1=1, m2=-2 => sum is -1, but wait l1 and l2 are both 1. So for each particle, m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible m2 can't be -2. Oh, so that's not possible. So what other combinations are there?

Another possibility is m1=0, m2=-1. That sums to -1. And another is m1=-1, m2=0. Because  (-1) + 0 = -1. Are there any others? Let me see, m1=+1 and m2=-2: but m2 can't be -2, so that's impossible. So the only possible combinations are (0, -1) and (-1, 0).

Wait, but wait, the total L is 2. So the state |1,1,2,-1> should be a combination of these possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to M=-1.

I think the general approach is to find the expansion of |L=2, M=-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. Because each product state has certain m1 and m2, which are the eigenvalues of L1z and L2z respectively.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1, and the coefficients come from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but given that the individual electrons have l1=1 and l2=1, so each can have m1 = -1, 0, +1, same for m2. But since L is 2 and M is -1, the only possible product states (m1, m2) that contribute are those where m1 + m2 = -1.

So those would be (0, -1) and (-1, 0). Because m1 can't be 1 and m2 can't be -2.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>. The coefficients for these would be given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but what's the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding two l=1 to get L=2, M=-1? I'm not exactly remembering the coefficients, but perhaps I can reason it out.

The general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients when adding two angular momenta is a bit involved, but for specific cases, sometimes it's easier to look them up or remember them.
