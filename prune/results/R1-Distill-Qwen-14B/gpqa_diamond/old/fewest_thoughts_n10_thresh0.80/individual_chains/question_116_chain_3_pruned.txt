Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll do my best to think it through.

So the question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's break down each part.

First, let's look at compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting can tell us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet implies each is next to three.

Looking at the integration: 6H as a triplet. That sounds like two sets of three equivalent protons each. Maybe like two methyl groups attached to something that splits their signals. Wait, a triplet could be from coupling with two neighboring protons. Oh, maybe it's a di-substituted ethyl group? Or perhaps it's two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons.

But wait, the quartet is 4H. Quartet suggests each proton is next to three others. So 4H as a quartetâ€”maybe a methylene group (CH2) next to a CH with three protons? Like maybe a CH2CH3 group? But wait, that would give a triplet for the CH2 and a quartet for the CH3, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet could be from a methylene group that's next to another CH2 group. Let me think. For example, if it's a CH2CH2 group, but that's not common. Oh wait, maybe it's a geminal coupling? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to a CH that has three protons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps compound A is 2,2-dimethylbutane? No, let me think again. Or maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? No, probably not.

Wait another approach: the triplet (6H) could be from two equivalent methyl groups on adjacent carbons, each next
