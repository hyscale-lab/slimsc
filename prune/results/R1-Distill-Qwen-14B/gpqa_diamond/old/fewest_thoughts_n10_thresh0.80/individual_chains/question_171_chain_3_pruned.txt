Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to electrophilic substitution reactions. Let me try to think this through step by step. The question is about the para-isomer yield in substitution reactions of various benzene derivatives with bromine. 

First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have six different compounds, each is a benzene ring with a substituent. When each reacts with excess bromine, which is a strong electrophilic substitution agent, they will form monobromo derivatives. The question is about the order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer for each. So, arrange them from the lowest to highest percentage of para product.

I remember that the para-directing groups activate the ring, making substitution more likely in certain positions. But wait, activating and deactivating substituents affect where the substitution happens. Oh right, activating groups are ortho/para directors, and deactivating are meta directors. So, the first thing I should do is classify each substituent based on whether they are activating or deactivating and their directing effect.

Let me list each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The substituent is a methyl group.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: This is benzene with an ethyl ester group, so it's like a benzoate ester.
3) C6H5-Cl: Benzene with a chlorine atom.
4) C6H5-NO2: Benzene with a nitro group.
5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. The substituent is an ethyl group.
6) C6H5-COOH: Benzene with a carboxylic acid group.

Now, for each substituent, I need to determine if it's activating or deactivating and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing.

1) Methyl group (-CH3): It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So, it's an ortho/para director.

2) COOEt (ester group): The carbonyl oxygen is more electronegative. Esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So, they are meta directors. Wait, but wait: esters like -COOR are actually ortho/para directors. Because even though the carbonyl is a deactivating group, the lone pairs on the oxygen can conjugate, making them ortho/para directors. Hmm, actually, wait. I'm a bit confused here. I think substituents with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro are meta directors, but esters are weaker and might be ortho/para. Wait, no. Wait, ester group is an activating group? No, wait. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's deactivating but ortho/para directing. Hmm, that's right. So for substituents: -COOR (ester) is deactivating (because of the carbonyl), but they are meta directors. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing this up. Wait, the ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so it deactivates the ring
