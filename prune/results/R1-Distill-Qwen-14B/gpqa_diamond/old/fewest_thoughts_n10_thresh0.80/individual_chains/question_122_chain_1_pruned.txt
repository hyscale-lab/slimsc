Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with acetic acid and going through several steps to form product 4. Then, we're supposed to determine how many distinct hydrogen signals are in product 4's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, let's break down each reaction step.

Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. I remember that acetic anhydride can act as a acetylation agent. Oh wait, when acetic acid reacts with bromine in presence of pyridine, that's probably a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait, acetic acid isn't an aromatic compound. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for arenes. Maybe it's a bromination? Or perhaps it's something else. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Oh, wait, acetic acid has a hydroxyl group. Oh, right! When acetic acid is treated with bromine and pyridine, it's likely undergoing bromination at the alpha position. Because the hydroxyl group is acidic, and in the presence of a base like pyridine, the -OH is deprotonated, making the alpha carbons susceptible to electrophilic substitution. So the alpha (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) would get brominated.

Wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH. The structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OH
   |
   CH3

Wait, no, the correct structure is CH3COOH. So when treated with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride, maybe it's an acetylation first. Oh wait, wait. Pyridine can act as a base, it can also help in absorbing HBr as it's a weak base. Also, acetic anhydride is a good acetylating agent. Oh wait, perhaps the conditions are for making an acetylated bromide. Or maybe it's a bromination of the alpha carbon.

Wait, when acetic acid reacts with Br2 and a base like pyridine, it undergoes alpha bromination. In this case, the alpha position is the methyl group attached
