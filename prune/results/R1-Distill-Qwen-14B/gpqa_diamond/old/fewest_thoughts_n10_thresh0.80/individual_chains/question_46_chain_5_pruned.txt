Okay, so I've got this question about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis means breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right? It's a process that can lead to the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Oh wait, Grubbs does ring-closing and ring-opening metathesis too, but I think in this case, it's about the ring-opening or maybe cross-metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. Let me draw this correctly.

Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3, but with a methyl group on the third carbon. So it's CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Let me think again. For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure should be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, the formula is C5H10? No, wait, no. Wait, the molecular formula of pent-1-ene is C5H10, but with a methyl branch on C3. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that makes sense. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, but wait, that's actually 3-methylpent-1-ene.

But wait, the molecule is symmetric around the double bond? Let me see: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So on C2, the substituents would be a methyl group (from the CH(CH3)) and a CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. So C2 has CH2 (from CH2=
