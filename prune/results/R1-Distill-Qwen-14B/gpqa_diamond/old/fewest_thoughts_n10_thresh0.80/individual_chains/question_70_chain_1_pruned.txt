Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are various point groups: C2, D4h, Dâˆžh, and C2v.

Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are determined based on the arrangement of atoms and their symmetry elements. So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what E is, and then its structure, which will tell me its symmetry.

Let me break down the reactions one by one.

1. Reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.
   - I'm thinking of a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas to form a colored product. Bright red makes me think about compounds like copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, which is blue, but maybe something else? Alternatively, maybe it's a metal sulfide? Oh wait, maybe reaction involving sulfur. Or perhaps a reaction where a metal oxide reacts with something. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide and B is a halogen.

Wait, let me think about another approach. The second reaction says that C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, a hazardous product. Then, C reacting with water gives back A and two acids F and G, with F being strong and G weak. That suggests that C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives a strong acid and a weak acid.

Hydrolysis of a salt typically gives an acid and a base. If F is strong and G is weak, that would imply that the salt of a strong base and weak acid. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If you have a salt like NaC, when it's hydrolyzed, it forms a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm, perhaps C is a sulfide? Because when sulfides react with water, they produce H2S (a weak acid?) and maybe another acid.

Wait, but sulfides reacting with water usually produce H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding base. Wait, maybe it's more likely that C is a nitride? Like Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But wait, NH3 is a weak base, but not an acid. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate or carbonate. Wait, another approach: the hydrolysis of a salt of a strong acid and weak base would produce a strong acid and a weak base. Wait, when a salt of a strong base and weak acid is hydrolyzed, it produces a weak acid and a strong base. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about specific examples.

For instance, consider NH4Cl. When NH4Cl is hydrolyzed in water, it produces NH4OH (which is NH3 + H2O, so NH3 is a weak base) and HCl. So, F would be HCl (strong acid), and G would be HNCOH (which is actually NH4OH, but since it's a weak base, when it dissociates, the acid formed is H+ from H2O? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis of C (a salt) produces two different acids. So, that would mean that C is a salt composed of two anions which are both acidic. Or perhaps one cation and one anion, each of which can hydrolyze to form acids
