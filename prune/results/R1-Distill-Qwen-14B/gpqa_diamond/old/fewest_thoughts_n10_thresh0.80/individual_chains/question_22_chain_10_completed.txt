Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here about oxygen acting as an oxidant in different solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. And the options are about whether it's stronger or weaker, and faster or slower.

Wait, I remember that thermodynamic and kinetic factors are different. Thermodynamics deals with the feasibility (whether a reaction is spontaneous) while kinetics deals with the rate (how fast it happens).

So, first part is about thermodynamics. In basic solutions, is oxygen a stronger or weaker oxidant? I think that in basic conditions, the oxidation of elements is more favorable because of the availability of OH- ions. Wait, oxygen is a good oxidizing agent because it's a strong oxidizer. But how does the solution pH affect its strength?

Wait, in acidic solutions, the reaction with oxygen might involve different ions. In basic solutions, oxygen could form hydroxide ions or something else. Let me think about standard reduction potentials. For O2, the reduction potential in acidic solution is higher than in basic. Oh wait, no. Let me recall: the standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic is E° = 1.23 V. In basic, I think it's the same because the reaction is adjusted for pH. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the effective concentration of H+ affects the potential. Oh wait, the Nernst equation considers concentration. So in basic solution, H+ is low, which would affect the potential. But how?

Alternatively, another approach: the ability to act as an oxidant relates to the ease of being reduced. In basic solutions, the O2 molecule is more likely to be reduced because the solution has more OH- which can stabilize the products. So maybe in basic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidant. Because in basic conditions, the reaction O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- is more favorable. Since the reduction potential would be higher in basic because OH- is available, making it a stronger oxidant.

So thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions. So the first blank is 'stronger'.

Now the second part: kinetically, in acidic solutions, how does oxygen react? Kinetics is about the rate. If in acidic conditions, the reaction might be slower because maybe the activation energy is higher. Or perhaps because of the presence of H+ ions that can affect the reaction mechanism.

Wait, I remember that in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 might involve the formation of H2O. The reaction is O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e- → 2 H2O. But in acidic conditions, perhaps the reaction is more kinetically favorable because H+ is available. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Because in basic conditions, the reaction might have a lower activation energy because OH- can stabilize the transition state more than H+? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, think about real reactions. For instance, in acidic conditions, the O2 might have a higher reaction rate because of the presence of H+ as a catalyst. But wait, sometimes, like in the oxygen electrode, the reaction is more favorable in basic conditions because of lower H+ which could cause lower overpotential. Oh wait, overpotential is about how much extra voltage you need to overcome the kinetic barriers. In basic solutions, the overpotential for O2 is lower, meaning the reaction can proceed more readily, hence faster kinetics.

Wait, so in acidic solutions, the reaction might be slower because the activation energy is higher. So kinetically, oxygen reacts slower in acidic solutions.

Putting it together: thermodynamically, stronger in basic. Kinetically, slower in acidic. Which would make the combination stronger and slower. Wait, the options are:

Looking at options, option B is stronger – slower. So the first blank is stronger, the second is slower.

Wait, the question says, which combination is correct? So the first statement is about the thermodynamic strength: stronger in basic solutions, and the second is kinetic behavior: react slower in acidic.

So the correct option is B.


To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of oxygen in different solutions.

1. **Thermodynamic Behavior in Basic Solutions**:  
   Thermodynamics deals with the spontaneity of a reaction. In basic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant because the reduction reaction, \( \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \), is more favorable. The availability of \(\text{OH}^-\) ions stabilizes the products, making oxygen a stronger oxidant in basic conditions compared to acidic conditions.

2. **Kinetic Behavior in Acidic Solutions**:  
   Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. In acidic solutions, the reaction of oxygen involves the formation of water, \( \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \). However, the presence of \(\text{H}^+\) ions can increase the activation energy, leading to slower reaction kinetics. Additionally, in acidic conditions, the overpotential for oxygen reduction is higher, further reducing the reaction rate.

Combining these insights, oxygen is thermodynamically a stronger oxidant in basic solutions and kinetically reacts slower in acidic solutions. The correct combination is **stronger – slower**, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
