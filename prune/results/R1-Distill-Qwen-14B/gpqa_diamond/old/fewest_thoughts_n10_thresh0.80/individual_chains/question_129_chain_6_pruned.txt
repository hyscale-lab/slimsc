Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out compound E based on the reaction steps given. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E. There are also some hints provided, which I'll need to use.

First, let me outline the steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm⁻¹, and E's IR is around 1715 cm⁻¹.

Okay, let's start by analyzing what each step does.

Step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, B would be a cyanohydrin as well. Wait, but looking at the IR hint, A has a peak at 1750 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is likely a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. But given the product from step 2, which is a reduction, and the possible structures, I think A is a cyclic ketone.

But wait, I should also consider the hint (a). It says when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. A phosphorous ylide is typically used in the Wittig reaction, which forms alkenes. So the ylide would attack a carbonyl group, replacing the O with the R2P=CH- part, creating an alkene.

So in the product, there's a cyclopentane ring. The substituents are 1,2-dimethyl and 4-(propan-2-ylidene). Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 being methyl groups, and position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group (which is like a CH(CH2CH3)= group? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C=, right? No, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=. Wait, maybe I should think of propan-2-ylidene as CH2-C(CH3)=, so the ylidene group is CH2–C(CH3)=.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at 1 and 2 positions, and at position 4, a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene. But propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C–, as in the ylide. So in the cyclopentane, position 4 is attached to a CH2 group which is connected to a carbond with a double bond (ylidene). So the structure would have a ring with two methyl groups on adjacent carbons and another substituent which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group.

Wait, but the Wittig reaction forms an alkene. So the starting material (A) must have a carbonyl group. So when the ylide (which is a strong base and a good nucleophile) reacts with the carbonyl, it forms an alkene.

So
