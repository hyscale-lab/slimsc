Okay, so I have this question about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with angular momentum states of electrons. Hmm, I remember that electrons have orbital angular momentum, which is quantified by quantum numbers. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbitals. P orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1 and l2, both equal to 1. The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, isn't that a bit confusing? Let me break it down. The state is |l1, l2, L, M>, I think. So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, L is 2, and M is -1.

Wait, but wait. The maximum L can be when adding two angular momenta. Each has l=1, so the possible L values are 0, 1, or 2. So L=2 is allowed. That makes sense because when you add two vectors with magnitude 1 each, the maximum possible sum is 2 (since 1+1=2).

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Specifically, what's the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ? Hmm. So each L_z has eigenvalues m * ħ. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, the eigenvalues for L_z are m * ħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1 because l=1.

So when we measure L1z and L2z, each can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. The question asks for the probability that both are -ħ.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, but wait. I've sometimes seen states written as |l1, l2, L, M>, but I have to remember that the state is a combination of the individual angular momenta. However, in this problem, we're ignoring the spin, so we're only considering their orbital angular momentum.

But wait, the state |1,1,2,-1> is the coupled state. That means it's a combination of the product states of individual states. So to find the probability, I think I need to expand this coupled state into the product basis states and see what the coefficients are for the product states where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Wait, but in the coupled state notation, the quantum numbers are L and M. L is 2 and M is -1.

Hmm. So the state |l1, l2, L, M> is a combination of all possible |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = M. Since M here is -1, m1 + m2 = -1. But in the problem, they are asking for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So adding them gives m1 + m2 = -2, which is not equal to M=-1. So that product state is not included in the coupled state?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The coupled state is a linear combination of product states where m1 + m2 = M. So in our case, M is -1. So all possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

So our state is a combination of:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0; 

m1 = 0, m2 = -1;

Wait, but wait, wait. For l1=1, m1 can be -1,0, +1.

Similarly for m2. So to get m1 + m2 = -1, the possible pairs are:

(-1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0), and any others?

Wait, no. Let me list all possible (m1, m2):

Possible m1 values: -1, 0, +1.

Possible m2 values: same.

So for m1 + m2 = -1:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0.

- m1 = 0, m2 = -1.

Are there any others? No, because the next possible would be m1 = -2, which isn't allowed since l=1, m can't be less than -1.

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> will be a combination of these two product states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but wait. How do the coefficients work in the expansion of the coupled state into product states? For two particles, the coupling involves Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, right?

I'm a bit rusty, but I think for two particles with angular momenta l1 and l2, the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = M. The coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, let me confirm: For L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 must sum to -1.

So the possible product states are:

|m1= -1, m2=0>,

|m1= 0, m2= -1>.

Other possibilities? Suppose m1=1 and m2=-2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1. So no.

So, the coupled state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a * |m1=-1, m2=0> + b * |m1=0, m2=-1>.

What are a and b? The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. I remember that for L=2, M=-1, the coefficients are sqrt( (2*(L-M) ) / ( (2L- M +1)(2L + M +1) ) ) ) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall that for two particles with l1 = l2 =1, the states |1,1, L, M> can be built by combining the m1 and m2 values.

But maybe I can think about the general approach without getting bogged down in the exact coefficients. Because ultimately, I'm trying to find the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ, which would correspond to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, in the coupled state, would the product state where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 be present? Because in that case, m1 + m2 = -2, and M for the coupled state is -1. So that product state isn't included in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, because for that state, M = -1. So the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> would have M = -2, which isn't the case here.

So, in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the only product states are those where m1 + m2 = -1. So the product states with m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

Therefore, the coefficients for the product states |m1=-1, m2=-1> is zero. So the amplitude for that product state is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero, because the square of the amplitude is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says that the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So that's a specific state. We're told to ignore the spin, so we're only dealing with the orbital angular momentum.

The problem is asking for the probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues -ħ. That would correspond to measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is |1,1,2,-2>? Wait, no, because L is 2, and M would be m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2. So the coupled state would be |1,1,2,-2>.

Wait, but our given coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So we're in a state where M=-1. The product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> (which would have M=-2) is not part of this state. Because our coupled state is built from product states that have M=-1, not lower.

So when we express |1,1,2,-1> in product states, the only terms are those where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the coefficients for any product state where m1 + m2 != -1 must be zero. Therefore, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not present in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>. Therefore, the amplitude for that product state is zero.

Hence, the probability is zero.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L^2 and L_z. So when you measure L_z, you get M=-1. The orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z are being measured. So the state is a combination of product states where m1 + m2 = M=-1. So the state can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, in terms of product states, the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by some Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

But the product state where both m1 and m2 are -1 isn't part of this state, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

So the correct answer is D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state, with the coupled angular momentum state given as $|1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $L = 2$, and $M = -1$. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$ where $m_1 + m_2 = M = -1$. The possible product states contributing to this coupled state are:

1. $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0>$
2. $|m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1>$

The product state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ is not included because $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \neq M = -1$. Therefore, the coefficient of the product state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ in the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is zero. Consequently, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: D
