Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can be tricky. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question has two separate reactions, A and B. I need to figure out what's happening in each and then match the products with the options provided.

Starting with Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+ to form product A.

Hmm. Spiro compounds are like two rings connected by a single atom, right? So 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol would have a spiro structure with a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring, and there's a vinyl group on the spiro atom, which is also the alcohol group.

The reagents are THF as a solvent, potassium hydride (KH), and then H+. I think THF is just a solvent here, maybe for the reaction. So KH is a strong base; it's often used for deprotonation. But wait, in some cases, especially with enolates or when forming rings, it might be used to deprotonate something and then form a new structure, like a cyclopropane or some kind of ring expansion.

Wait, another thought: spiro compounds can sometimes undergo ring-opening or form new rings under certain conditions. Maybe under basic conditions, the alcohol could deprotonate, but wait, the alcohol is on a spiro structure. Alternatively, the vinyl group might participate in some kind of conjugate addition or elimination.

Wait, wait. I remember that when there's a spiro structure with a conjugated double bond, heating or using a base can lead to a ring-opening, perhaps forming a diradical or undergoing some kind of electrocyclic reaction. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, I've heard of the Cope rearrangement, but that's more about 1,5-dienes. Or maybe a Claisen rearrangement? Not sure. Or perhaps this is a case of a ring-expansion via an enolate?

Wait, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro junction is at position 1, which is an alcohol and also has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So the structure probably looks like a five-membered ring (maybe cyclohexene?) and a three-membered ring attached at the same carbon.

When you have a spiro structure with an alcohol and a conjugated double bond, using a strong base like KH could deprotonate the alcohol to form an oxide (or an alkoxide). But with the presence of a double bond, maybe some kind of conjugate addition or elimination happens.

Wait, I think there's a reaction where an enol ether or similar structure can undergo a ring-opening upon heating or with a base. Alternatively, perhaps a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a pinacol rearrangement. But the pinacol rearrangement usually involves
