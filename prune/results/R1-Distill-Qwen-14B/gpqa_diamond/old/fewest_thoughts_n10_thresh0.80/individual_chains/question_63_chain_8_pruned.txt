Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D, each with different momentum values.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is also called the rotation-vibration model. So, I remember that in such a model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, the molecule is currently in the lowest possible energy state, and a photon is absorbed to make it go to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the next state—so perhaps the first excited state, but I'm not sure if it's about rotation or vibration. Alternatively, maybe it's a combined state, like a vibrational and rotational change.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which suggests that both rotation and vibration are considered. So, the energy levels are quantized for both.

But when the molecule is in its fundamental state, that's the state of lowest energy. So, the next state with the lowest possible energy—so maybe it's the next higher energy state. But what's the structure of these states?

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. For a rigid rotor, the vibrational energy levels are given by the quantum harmonic oscillator: E_vib = (n + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency.

But wait, the problem states it's using the non-rigid rotor model, which complicates things a bit because the bond length isn't fixed, but I'm not sure how that affects the analysis here. Maybe I can proceed with the rigid rotor approximation for now.

So, the fundamental state would have the lowest possible vibrational and rotational energies. So, the vibrational state is n=0 (the ground state), and the rotational state is J=0 (the ground state). So, the total energy is E = E
