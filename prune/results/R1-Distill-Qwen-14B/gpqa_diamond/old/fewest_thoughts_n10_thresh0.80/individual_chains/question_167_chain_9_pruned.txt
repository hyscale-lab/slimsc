Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the problem defines the state |psi> as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

The non-Gaussianity is measured using the relative entropy, del_b, which is calculated as the trace of (rho ln rho) minus the trace of (tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a density matrix with a Gaussian distribution in phase space, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are those that don't fit into this category, like Fock states (number states) or Schrödinger cat states, which are superpositions of coherent states.

The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. If the state is Gaussian, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero because rho would be the same as tau.

But wait, so how do I compute this for the given state? Let me break it down.

First, the state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Let me plug in the given values. phi is -pi/4, so sin(2*phi) is sin(-pi/2) which is -1. Oh, but wait, in the normalization N, we have sin(2*phi) times exp(-2 alpha^2). So let me compute that.

Alpha is 0.5, so alpha^2 is 0.25, and 2*alpha^2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. Then sin(2*(-pi/4)) is sin(-pi/2) which is -1. So sin(2*phi)*exp(...) is (-1)*(0.6065) = -0.6065. So the denominator N is sqrt(1 + (-0.6065)) because N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2 alpha squared)). Wait, 1 + (-0.6065) is 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) which is approximately 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275. Let me compute the coefficients. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.
