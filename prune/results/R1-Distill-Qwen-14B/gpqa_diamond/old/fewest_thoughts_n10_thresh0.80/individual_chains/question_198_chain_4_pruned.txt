Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on. The question is about cobalt ions reacting with thiocyanate to form complexes, and I need to find the percentage of a specific blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species. Hmm, I remember that dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached to Co(II).

Alright, the given data: the concentration of Co(II) is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but here β3 is higher than β2 and β4 is lower. So maybe the complexes aren't following a straightforward trend beyond a certain point. Oh, that's interesting.

I think the first step is to write down the possible complexes. Co(II) can form complexes with SCN- as a ligand. The possible complexes are:

Co²+ → [Co(SCN)]²+ (monodentate?), [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (maybe dithiocyanato?), [Co(SCN)_3]^2-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^0? Or maybe I'm getting the charges wrong. Wait, each SCN- is -1. So the charge of the complex would be Co²+ plus n*(-1). So:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ : n=1 → 2+ -1 = +1
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0: n=2 → 2+ -2=0
- [Co(SCN)_3]^−: n=3 → 2+ -3= -1
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2−: n=4 → 2+ -4= -2

Wait, but the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is for the first complex, which has one SCN- ligand. So β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-]) = 9.

Similarly, β2 is for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0: β2
