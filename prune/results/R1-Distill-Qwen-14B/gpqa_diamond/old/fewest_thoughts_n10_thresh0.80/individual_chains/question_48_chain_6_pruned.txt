Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I need to track each step and then determine the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

First, let me outline the reactions:

1. Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1.
2. Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.
3. Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming product 3.
4. Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (which I think is a strong reducing agent), forming product 4.

The question is, how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4?

Let me break down each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a ketone bromination. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group. But bromine in what conditions? Oh, wait, maybe it's an addition reaction if it's in a certain solvent. Or is it more likely a substitution? No, wait, I think when ketones react with Br2, it's an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, where a bromide is added to the alpha position. But wait, that usually requires a catalyst like a Lewis acid. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Another possibility is that cyclohexanone might undergo an enolate formation, leading to some kind of addition. Or maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexanone undergoes a diels-alder-like reaction with bromine? No, that's more for conjugated dienes. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via an enol intermediate. Let me think. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens. So when treated with Br2, perhaps it undergoes bromination at the alpha position. So the product would be alpha-bromo cyclohexanone.

Wait, the reaction of ketones with Br2 is typically for the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, which adds bromine to the alpha position. So cyclohexanone would form 2-bromocyclohexanone. So product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with NaOH.
