Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, specifically about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, neutral hydrogen clouds absorb it, right? So if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the wavelength we observe would be longer than 1216 Angstroms because of the redshift.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm, in the far UV). If the cloud is moving away from us (due to the expansion of the universe), this wavelength would be redshifted. So what we observe would be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

But optical telescopes on the ground can't detect wavelengths longer than about 1 micrometer (1000 nm or 10000 Angstroms) because the atmosphere absorbs them. So the observed wavelength must be less than around 10,000 Angstroms for optical telescopes to see it. Wait, but wait, I think the cutoff is actually lower. I've heard that the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths longer than about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), so optical telescopes can't see beyond that. Or is it 1000 nm? I might be mixing things up.

Wait, visible light is roughly 400-700 nm. So anything beyond 700 nm (like near-infrared) is not visible to the human eye. But ground-based optical telescopes might not be able to detect wavelengths longer than about 1 micrometer (1000 nm) in some cases. But I'm not too sure about the exact cutoff.

So the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) is in the far UV, which can't penetrate the atmosphere. But if it's redshifted into the optical range, ground-based telescopes can observe it.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength.

So emitted wavelength λ_emit = 1216 Angstroms.

Observed λ_obs must be less than the maximum wavelength that the optical telescope can detect. Let's assume that maximum is about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), but wait, no, 7000 Angstroms is 700 nm, which is in the visible. Wait, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So if the observed wavelength is just reaching 7000 Angstroms, that's the maximum.

Wait, but wait, if the observed wavelength is 7000 Angstroms, then:

z = (7000 - 1216) / 1
