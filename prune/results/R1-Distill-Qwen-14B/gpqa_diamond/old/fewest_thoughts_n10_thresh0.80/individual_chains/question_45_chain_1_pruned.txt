Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of a given energy E, where E is pi² ℏ²/(2mL²). The options are multiple-choice, from A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n²) * (pi² ℏ²)/(2mL²), right? So each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. Since E is given as pi² ℏ²/(2mL²), that means E_n = n² * E.

Wait, but wait a second. The particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers, including their spin. So each energy level can hold a certain number of particles.

In a one-dimensional well, each state is characterized by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since the particles are spin-1/2, each has two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can hold two particles: one with spin-up and another with spin-down.

Wait, but wait again. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n, because there's only one spatial direction. So for each n, you can have two particles (spin up and spin down). But wait, the problem says four identical particles. So I need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion principle.

So for four particles:

- The ground state would have the lowest possible n's. Let me think: n=1 can hold two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can also hold two. So the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) are each filled with two particles. So the energies would be E_1 and E_2.

Wait, but wait, the ground state is the lowest possible energy. So the particles would fill the lowest possible n values with their spins. So n=1: two particles (spin up and down). n=2: two more (spin up and down). So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Each particle in n=1 has energy E, so two particles: 2E. Each particle in n=2 has energy 4E (since E_n = n² E), so two particles: 8E. Wait, wait, no: wait, no, each particle in n=2 has energy 4E, but there are two particles. So 2*4E=8E. So total energy is 2E +8E =10E? Wait, no, wait a second.

Wait, all the particles are spin-1/2, so each n can hold two particles. So for four particles, we need n=1 and n=2 each filled with two particles. So their energies are E each for n=1, so two particles contribute 2E. For n=2, each particle contributes 4E, two particles: 8E. So total energy is 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the ground state is the first energy given in each option. Let's see:

Option A) 30E, 39E,50E: those are all way higher than 10E.

Option B) 4E,10E,50E: ground state is 4E? That doesn't make sense. Because four particles in the ground state should have lower energy than that.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps
