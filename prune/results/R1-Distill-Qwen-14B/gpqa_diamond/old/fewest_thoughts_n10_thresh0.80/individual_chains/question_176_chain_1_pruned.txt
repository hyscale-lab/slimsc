Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors with complex numbers, right? Oh wait, but maybe here they're just using real numbers for simplicity. Or perhaps the state is being normalized. Hmm, maybe I should check that first. Wait, but the problem is about measuring observables P and Q. Observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, so the eigenvalues are real, and the probabilities are calculated based on the state's projection onto the eigenstates.

First, the operator P has a matrix. Let me write that down. P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, let me see if P is Hermitian. Since all elements are real, it's symmetric. So yes, it's Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real.

The operator Q is another 3x3 matrix. First row [1, 0, 0], second row [0, 0, 0], third row [0, 0, -1]. That looks diagonal, so the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. Oh, wait, no. Because the diagonal elements are 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.

The question is: what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the sequence is first measure P, then measure Q. Wait, no, wait: the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the process is measure P first, then Q. Wait no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, it says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order
