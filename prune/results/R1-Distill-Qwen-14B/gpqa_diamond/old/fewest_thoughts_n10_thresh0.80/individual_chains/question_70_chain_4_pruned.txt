Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions with various compounds A, B, C, D, etc. The key part is determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. 

First, I need to figure out what each compound is based on the reactions described. Let's break down each reaction one by one.

1. **Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.**
   - The mention of '8 equivalents' suggests that the mole ratio of A to B is 1:8. So, perhaps A is something that reacts in a 1:8 ratio with B. Bright red product C might give a clue. What compounds are bright red? I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur or perhaps a product involving transition metals. Another thought: in some reactions, like the synthesis of certain complexes, stoichiometry can be high. For example, if A is Fe (iron) and B is Cl2, maybe forming FeCl3? But iron(III) chloride isn't red. Alternatively, maybe A is something else, like sulfur reacting with oxygen? Not sure yet.

2. **Reaction 2: Product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.**
   - The fact that E is extremely hazardous makes me think of something like phosgene (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas—like chlorine gas? Wait, but C reacting with D to form E. Let's think about possible reactions. If C is a metal chloride, and D is perhaps a gas like Cl2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if C is something like SO3, and D is H2O, but that forms H2SO4, which isn't extremely hazardous in that form. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, and D is something else. Hmm, maybe C is a nitride? Wait, but I'm not getting it yet.

3. **Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid.**
   - So, when C is treated with water, it produces A, which is a solid, and two acids. One strong, one weak. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak are like CH3COOH, H3PO4, etc. Since two different acids are formed, perhaps C is an acid derivative. For example, maybe C is a sulfite or something that can hydrolyze into different acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like ammonium sulfide, which on hydrolysis gives NH3 (but that's a base) and H2S. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For instance, if C is FeS, reacting with water would produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S, but I'm not certain. Or perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is NaNO2, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonamide? No, perhaps another approach.

Wait, if C reacts with water to form A, which is a solid, and two acids. Let's think about the possible compounds. Suppose A is NaCl, but then C would need to be something that, upon hydrolysis, gives NaCl and two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like MgSO4·7H2O, which when heated gives MgSO4 and water. But that doesn't produce acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. Let's think: if C is CaCO3, and upon reaction with water (maybe under certain conditions), but I'm not sure. Wait, but CaCO3 is inert in water unless with acid. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if C reacts with water to form A, which is a solid, and two acids. Let's think about the possible acids. Strong acid F and weak acid G. So, maybe F is HCl and G is H2S? Or F could be H2SO4 and G something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like NH4Cl and another salt. Wait, no, because C reacts with water to produce A (a solid) and two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if C is K2S, then reacting with water
