Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says the crystal is rhombohedral with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) is calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ) ), or something like that. Or wait, is it related to the reciprocal lattice? Oh right, the general formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system might be a bit different because all the angles are the same.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, it's a type of hexagonal crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are equal too. In this case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a special case where a = b = c, and the angles are all the same.

Wait, but when a, b, c are equal and angles are equal, it's actually a cubic system if the angles are 90 degrees. But here, the angles are 30, so it's a rhombohedral or maybe a hexagonal? No, hexagonal has two different angles. So rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal, but with all angles equal. Wait, I think in the hexagonal system, a=b, c is different, and angles are alpha=90, beta=90, gamma=120 or something. But here, all three angles are 30, but a=b=c, so it's a rhombohedral system.

Wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Hmm, wait—the interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between adjacent atoms. In a simple cubic structure, that would be the lattice parameter a. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the vertices of the unit cell, but I'm not sure if the interatomic distance is just 'a' or not. Wait, no
