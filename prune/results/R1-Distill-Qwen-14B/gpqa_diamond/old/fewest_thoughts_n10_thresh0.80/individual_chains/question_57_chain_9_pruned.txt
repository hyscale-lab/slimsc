Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is a key concept. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, phase shifts... right, in partial wave analysis, each partial wave is associated with a phase shift δ_l. The scattering amplitude f is related to these phase shifts. Oh right, the formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) / sin(θ - something). Or wait, maybe it's more involved.

Oh wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the direction of the incident beam. That probably corresponds to the case where the scattering angle θ is zero, meaning the particles are scattered along the same direction as the incident beam. So, θ = 0 degrees.

I think the scattering amplitude for each partial wave is given by f_l(θ) = (1/(k)) * (2l + 1) * [sin(δ_l) / (1 + cosθ) ] * e^{2iδ_l} or something along those lines. But wait, when θ is zero, cosθ is 1, so the denominator becomes 2. 

Alternatively, I've heard about the optical theorem which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The optical theorem says that Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Because the problem gives individual phase shifts, maybe it's better to approach it directly.

Wait, each partial wave contributes to the scattering amplitude. The full scattering amplitude is a sum over l of the partial waves. So, f(θ) = Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l * (something) ]

Let me think about the exact formula. The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = ∑_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) / (k (2l + 1)) )? Wait, no, maybe it's f(θ) = (1/(k)) ∑ (2l
