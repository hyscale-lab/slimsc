Okay, so I have this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm. Let's think through this step by step.

The question says both planets have the same minimum mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1. 

They also have the same host star radii. But their host stars have different masses: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But since both stars have the same radius, that probably affects other factors.

Wait, transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh, right, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, actually, the geometric probability for a transit is roughly (R_planet + R_star)/(a) where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me recall: the probability P is approximately (R*/a), where R* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective. The chance depends on the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit.

Wait, wait, more accurately, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P ≈ (R_*/a), where R_ is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Because the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a, and the chance it aligns in front is the area of the star's disk compared to the area of the orbit, but actually, it's more like (R_*/a) because it's the ratio of linear dimensions, not area. So P ∝ R*/a.

But wait, how do we get a? We can relate the orbital period to a using Kepler's third law. Since both planets are around their respective stars, with masses M1 and M2, and orbital periods P1 and P2.

Kepler's third law says (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M + m)/(4π²). Since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars', we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So a^3 ∝ P^2 * M, so a
