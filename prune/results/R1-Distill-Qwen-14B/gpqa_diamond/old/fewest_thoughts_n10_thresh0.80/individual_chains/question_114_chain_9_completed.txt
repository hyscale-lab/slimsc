Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. It's about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I need to go step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with cyanide, I remember that sometimes it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, the product here has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, but wait a second. Butan-2-one (acetone) reacting with NaCN. I think when ketones react with HCN (or its sources like NaCN with acid), they add a cyanide group. Oh, but in this case, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh, maybe it's a substitution of the carbonyl oxygen.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydroxy group formation. Oh, right! The first reaction is probably the formation of a cyanohydrin. Acetone (butan-2-one) reacting with HCN (or NaCN in the presence of acid) would form a cyanohydrin. The product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, I think. So the reagent A here would be an acid, like H3O+ (since NaCN plus acid would generate HCN, which adds to the ketone).

So for the first part, reagent A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical reagents for oxidizing nitriles are things like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or using other strong oxidizing agents. But wait, in the presence of water, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. The conditions for that usually involve strong acid or base. Oh right, in acidic conditions, H+ and heat. Or maybe using something like H2O with HCl (concentrated) as a catalyst.

But wait, the product here is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. The typical reagent for that is H2O with H3O+ (acidic conditions) and heat. Oh, but sometimes they use other acids as catalysts. Alternatively, maybe using HCl as the reagent B.

Looking at the options, reagent B is H2O, but the actual reagent is possibly HCl. Wait, the second step says reagent B is H2O. Wait no, the question says that the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. Wait, the way the question is written: the second reaction is the nitrile compound plus B (H2O) leading to the acid. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the reaction is written as 2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) gives the acid. So perhaps B is an aqueous solution, but what's the catalyst?

Wait, the reagent B is H2O, but the actual reagent might be something else. Wait, looking at the options, the choices are for reagents A and B. Let me check the options. The options are A and B for each part.

In the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is given as H2O? Or is it that the reagent is H2O and another substance? Let me re-read the question.

The second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, so H2O is the reagent B. But for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, you usually need an acid catalyst. So H2O alone might not be enough; you need something like HCl or another acid.

Wait, perhaps B is HCl. But the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH, looking at the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl
Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH
Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl
Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So for the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, the way it's written is a bit confusing. The question says "reagent B (H2O)"? Or is B the reagent, and H2O is part of it? Hmm, perhaps the reaction is that the compound is treated with H2O in the presence of reagent B. Or maybe B is the reagent, perhaps an acid like HCl or acetic acid, along with H2O.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically occurs under strong acidic conditions with H2O. For example, using concentrated HCl and heating, or using aqueous H2SO4 with heat. Alternatively, using H2O in acidic conditions.

So in the second reaction, reagent B is H2O. But to make the nitrile into a carboxylic acid, you need an acid catalyst. So perhaps the reagent is H2O with HCl, but looking at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, the question says that reagent B is H2O. Wait, no, the way it's written: "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid."

Wait, perhaps B is H2O in the presence of another reagent. Wait, perhaps B is HCl, because the reaction needs acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reagent is H2O and HCl as the acid. So in the options, for part B, the reagent is HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B, D).

Wait, but the reaction is written as the compound plus B (H2O) yields the product. So perhaps B is H2O, but that can't be correct because H2O alone won't cause the hydrolysis. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the reagent is B, which is H2O, but that seems unlikely because the reaction conditions probably require more.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent is H2O in the presence of acid. So, for example, if B is HCl, then in the reaction, HCl and H2O are present.

But in the options, when looking at reagent B, the options for B are either HCl or acetic acid.

So the first reaction required A to be H3O+ (acid) because it's a cyanohydrin formation. So looking at options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So options A and B are possible.

So the first part's reagent is H3O+ (A), so options A and B are candidates.

Then for the second reaction, reagent B must be something that can cause the nitrile to become a carboxylic acid. So in acidic conditions, we can use HCl (like option A) or acetic acid (option B).

Wait, but what's the typical conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid? I think concentrated HCl with heat or strong acids like H2SO4. Alternatively, using a solution of H2O with HCl (like aq. HCl) as the catalyst.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B would be HCl, which is option A (since B in option A is HCl) or option C where B is HCl.

Wait, but looking back, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Hmm, perhaps B is H2O but with a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the reagent is H2O and another acid. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says: the reagents are A and B, corresponding to the two reactions. So the first reaction uses A, and the second uses B.

Wait, looking at the question again:

1. butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

2. product + B (H2O) → another product.

Wait, the wording says that B is H2O. So for the second reaction, the reagent is H2O. Oh wait, no, that can't be right because H2O alone wouldn't cause the nitrile to hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. So perhaps B is the catalyst for the hydrolysis, such as HCl or another acid.

Wait, perhaps reagent B is HCl, and the reaction uses H2O as the solvent. So the reagent B is HCl. So in the second reaction, it's H2O as the solvent, but the acid is HCl.

So looking at the options, which have B as HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+; and for the second, B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. That would fit.

Wait, but wait another possibility: another way to get the nitrile to become a carboxylic acid is through hydrolysis with a strong base, but that usually gives a carboxylate, which is then acidified. But here, the product is the acid, so probably acidic conditions.

So for the second reaction, the reagent is HCl (B=HCl) in H2O.

So putting it all together, the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me check the options again.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

Wait, no, another thought. Could the second reaction be using a different reagent? For example, perhaps it's a hydrolysis in basic conditions, but the product is acid. So maybe using a strong base and then acidifying. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The standard condition for that is HCN (or NaCN) in acidic conditions, so A is H3O+.

The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Hydrolysis under acidic conditions with H2O and H+ (like HCl) would do that.

So reagent B is HCl.

So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acidic environment to generate HCN from NaCN, which then adds to the carbonyl group of the ketone. Therefore, the reagent A must be an acid, specifically H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This hydrolysis reaction requires strong acidic conditions, typically using HCl (H₂O as the solvent). The reagent B must therefore be HCl to facilitate this transformation.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (acetic acid) is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid that promotes cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are incorrect for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
