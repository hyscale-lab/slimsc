Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because substitution reactions aren't my strongest topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of some benzene derivatives with excess bromine. The goal is to arrange six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, weight fraction... so the percentage of the para product in each reaction.

Each compound is a benzene ring with a substituent. Let's list them:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, I should note which substituents are activating and which are deactivating. Because activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions.

Electrophilic substitution usually occurs where the substituent directs. So activating groups are ortho/para directors, while deactivating are meta directors. But wait, there's a twist. Some substituents are strongly deactivating, like nitro groups, which are meta directors. Others, like -Cl, are deactivating but ortho/para directors because they are lone pairs available.

Let me list each substituent's directing effect:

1) CH3 (toluene): activating, ortho/para director.
2) COOEt (ethyl ester): the ester group is deactivating (since it's an electron-withdrawing group), but it's an ortho/para director. Wait, wait. No, wait. Esters have a carbonyl group. The carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group, which makes the ring less reactive. So the ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group? Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are classified based on their electron effects. 

Let me recall: the carbonyl group in an ester (like O=C-O-) is a meta director. Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing by induction, so it deactivates the ring. But wait, sometimes substituents can
