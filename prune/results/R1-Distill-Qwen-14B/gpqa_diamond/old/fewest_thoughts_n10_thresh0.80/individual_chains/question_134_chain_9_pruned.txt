Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy change when mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. They give the volumes and concentrations for each. Oh right, enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. I remember that strong acids and strong bases typically release a lot of heat, but this might get complicated because there are three substances involved.

Wait, but wait, I think that when you mix an acid with a base, the neutralization reaction can sometimes be more complex, especially if it's a polyprotic acid. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is diprotic. So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base—barium hydroxide. Each Ba(OH)2 can provide two OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So the first thing I need to do is figure out the moles of each acid and base, then determine the limiting reagent to see how much reaction actually happens.

Let's break it down.

First, calculate the moles for each solution.

For HCl: Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Concentration 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. But wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. So each mole can produce two H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Concentration 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the reaction between acids and bases is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. But wait, I have a mix of two acids and a base. Hmm, so probably, the acids will donate H+ and the base will provide OH-, and they'll neutralize each other.

So total H+ from both acids is HCl's + H2SO4's H+.

HCl gives 0.1 moles of H+ (since it's a monoprotic acid).
H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles of H+.
So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles.

So when they react, the H+ and OH- will combine. Let's see which is the limiting reagent.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So moles of H+ and OH- needed are 1:1.

We have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So OH- is the limiting reagent because 0.2 is less than 0.28. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles. So the moles of water formed is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy change for each mole of
