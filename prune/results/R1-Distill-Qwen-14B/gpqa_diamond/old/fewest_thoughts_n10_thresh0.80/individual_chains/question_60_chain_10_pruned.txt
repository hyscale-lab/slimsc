Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens live about 150 solar years on average. Their astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective. The options are, well, whether he dies or not, and some years.

Wait, the question is about the astronaut's experienced time. So I think this is a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to another observer. From the astronaut's perspective, they're stationary, and the Earth is moving towards them. But wait, no, the ship is moving towards Earth, so from Earth's frame, the ship is moving fast, and from the ship's frame, Earth is moving towards them. But the time experienced on the ship would be less due to time dilation.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the time from Earth's frame and then apply the Lorentz factor to get the astronaut's time.

Wait, I think the key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the shortest time measured in the moving frame, right? So in this case, the astronaut is in the moving frame, so their proper time is shorter than the time observed from Earth.

But wait, how do I find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth? Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is one of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Let me recall, the distance from the Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years. Wait, is that right? I think it's about 160,000 light-years away, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think, the Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million light-years away. So if the LMC is about 160k ly, that seems about right. So the distance is roughly 160,000
