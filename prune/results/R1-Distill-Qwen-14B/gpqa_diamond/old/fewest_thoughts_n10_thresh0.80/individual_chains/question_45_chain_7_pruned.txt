Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let's see. The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh wait, they're spin-1/2, so electrons or something similar. But wait, in a one-dimensional well, do the spin states affect the energy levels? I think for the energy levels, it's the quantum number that matters, spin might influence the possible states but not the energy. So maybe for calculating the energy, I can treat them as fermions obeying the Pauli exclusion principle.

The system is a 1D infinite potential well of length L. I remember that the energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. So E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), which means each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared. So for a particle in state n, energy is n² E.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Since they are spin-1/2, they are fermions, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can be occupied by at most two particles because of the two possible spin states (up and down). So the total number of particles can't exceed twice the number of available quantum states.

So the problem is to find the ground state, first excited, and second excited energies. Each state will have the particles filled up according to the lowest possible energy with the exclusion principle in mind.

Let me think about how the particles fill the energy levels. For four particles, the first few energy levels would be filled in order.

Let me outline the possible states:

Each energy level n can hold 2 particles (since spin up and down). So the first level (n=1) holds 2, the second (n=2) holds 2, and then n=3 holds 2, etc.

But wait, since we have four particles, let's see:

- The ground state (lowest energy) would have the two particles in n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two in n=2 (again, opposite spins). So n=1 and n=2 filled, with each holding 2 particles. That would account for all four particles.

Wait, but no, wait. For four particles, each level can take two, so n=1: 2, n=2: 2. So all four are filled into the first two levels.

So the ground state energy is the sum of each particle's energy, but wait, no, the energy of the system is the sum of all individual energies. So for the ground state, two particles are in n=1, and two in n=2.

Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1²)=E. There are two of them, so 2E. Particles in n=2 contribute E*(2²)=4E each, two particles: 8E. So total E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, each particle in n=2 contributes 4E, so two particles contribute 8E. So total energy would be 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. But let me check the options. Looking at the options, let's see: option B has 4E, 10E, 50E. Option C has 4E, 10E, 15E. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because if particles are spin-1/2, each quantum state can hold two particles. So for four particles, the filling would be:

n=1: 2 particles (each with m_s = +1/2 and -1/2)
n=2: 2 particles.

So energy would be E*(1²) for each particle in n=1, and E*(2²
