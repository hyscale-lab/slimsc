Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Since we're mixing two equal volumes, the concentration should be halved. Let me calculate that.

Original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When diluted with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Wait, 20 divided by 40 is 0.5, so 0.05 * 0.5 is 0.025 M. So diluted to 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react with the weak acid (acetic acid) in a neutralization reaction. The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the moles of acetic acid and then see how much has been neutralized.

Wait, but first, maybe I should calculate the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me compute the moles of acetic acid initially. The diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. Moles = concentration × volume (in liters). So 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol. But the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So first, let's tackle the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but wait, when titrated, the NaOH reacts with the acetic acid. So
