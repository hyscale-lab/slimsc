Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question about a transmission electron microscope. Hmm, let me read it again.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution TEM that's operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment—like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, right? The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible so that the electron beam doesn't get scattered too much. But even then, some gas particles are left, and the mass spectrometer detected them. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on the pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecule, and P the pressure. So lower pressure (higher vacuum) means a longer mean free path.

But when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path becomes λ2 instead of staying λ1. The temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. The question is why λ2 would be different.

Wait, the electron beam is being used. So what happens when the electrons are fired? Oh, right, the electrons interact with the gas molecules. But how does that affect the mean free path?

In the initial state, the gas molecules are just moving around, but when the electron beam is on, the electrons must be scattering off the gas molecules. So the electrons are providing additional collisions for the gas molecules. 

So the gas molecules now have another source of collisions—the electrons. So if the gas molecules are colliding more frequently because of the electron beam, their mean free path would decrease. Because mean free path is inversely proportional to the number of collisions. If collisions happen more, the mean free path is shorter.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the mean free path formula again. The mean free path λ is proportional to 1/(P). But when you have an electron beam, the gas molecules can collide not only with each other but also with the electrons. So the effective pressure increases because there's another factor causing collisions.

Wait, but the pressure in the compartment is still the same, right? Because the pumps are running and the pressure hasn't changed. So the vacuum level (pressure) is the same as before. But the presence of the electron beam introduces more interactions. So the gas molecules are now being hit by electrons as well as possibly colliding with each other.

But wait, the mean free path λ1 was calculated without considering the electron beam. When the beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which would cause more frequent collisions. So the effective mean free path should be shorter than λ1. Because the electrons are acting as another source of scattering, thereby reducing the average distance the gas molecules can move without hitting something.

So λ2, the mean free path during the electron beam operation, should be less than λ1. So among the options, C says λ2 < λ1, which would be correct.

But let me make sure. What else could affect the mean free path? The presence of the electron beam might ionize the gas molecules, but even if they become charged, their mean free path would be affected. But I think the main effect here is the collision frequency.

Alternatively, if the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move faster, that could change the mean free path. But the temperature is the same, so thermal speeds shouldn't change. The electron beam's energy is much higher than the thermal energy, but the molecules' average kinetic energy is still based on temperature. So that part remains the same.

Wait, but the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, right? The electrons in a TEM are accelerated to a high voltage—like 1000 kV here. That's a lot. So when they collide with the gas molecules, the electrons might transfer some momentum, but since the gas molecules are much heavier, the effect on the electrons' speed is negligible. But for the gas molecules, each collision with an electron would cause a change in their velocity, but perhaps not as much as a collision with another gas molecule, which might have a similar mass.

So each collision with an electron would contribute to reducing the mean free path. So the presence of the electron beam effectively increases the collision rate of the gas molecules, making their mean free path shorter than λ1.

So the correct answer should be C: λ2 < λ1.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment with a mean free path of gas molecules determined to be λ1. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. This change can be explained by the additional interactions between the gas molecules and the electron beam.

The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions and is inversely proportional to the collision frequency. Initially, λ1 was calculated based on the vacuum state, considering factors like pressure, temperature, and molecular size. When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules now experience additional collisions due to interactions with the high-energy electrons. These collisions increase the effective collision frequency, thereby reducing the mean free path. Since the temperature remains constant, the primary factor affecting λ is the increased collision frequency caused by the electron beam.

Thus, λ2, the mean free path during electron beam operation, is shorter than λ1. This conclusion aligns with the fact that the electron beam introduces additional scattering events, reducing the average distance gas molecules can travel without colliding.

Answer: C
