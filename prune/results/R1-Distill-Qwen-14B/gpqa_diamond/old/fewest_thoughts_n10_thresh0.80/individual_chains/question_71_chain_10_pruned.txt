Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. They're in orbital resonance with periods in a specific ratio: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. And the planets have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the calculation.

The main thing I need to find is the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So, I need to find T4 divided by T2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I think the formula for that is T = T_earth * ( ( L / (1361) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ) * ( ( (d_earth) / d ) )^(1/2) )... Wait, no, I'm mixing some variables here. Let me get that right.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The planet radiates as a blackbody, so the power it emits is proportional to T^4. The planet absorbs energy from the star, which is L (luminosity) multiplied by the area it intercepts, which is πr², and then divided by the distance squared, so L/(4πd²) multiplied by πr², leading to (L r²)/(4 d²). But wait, that's when the planet's radius is r.

Wait, no, equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy. So,

Absorbed power: (L * (π R²)) / (4π d²) * (1 - a) ) = (L R² (1 - a)) / (4 d²)
Emitted power: 4π R² σ T^4

Setting them equal:
(L R² (1 - a)) / (4 d²) ) = 4 π R² σ T^4
Simplify: L (1 - a) / (16 π d²) ) = σ T^4

Solving for T:
T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d² ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, but L is the star's luminosity. Since all planets are around the same star, L and σ are constants. Also, the albedo (a) is the same for all planets here.

So, the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance, because d^2 in the denominator. So T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(d).

But wait, since T scales with (1/d)^(1/2), the ratio of T4 to T2 would be sqrt(d2/d4). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), so T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2) ).

Wait, no, let me think again. If T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), then T4 = k / sqrt(d4), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So the ratio is T4
