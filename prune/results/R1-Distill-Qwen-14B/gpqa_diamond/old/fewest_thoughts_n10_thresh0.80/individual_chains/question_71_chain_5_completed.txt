Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L/L_sun) / (a^2) )^0.25, but wait, L is the star's luminosity. Oh wait, but in this case, all the planets are around the same star, so L is the same for all. So the T ratio would depend only on the square of the distance.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: T = T_effective of the star * ( (R_star / (2a)) )^(-2) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. But wait, all planets have the same albedo, so that factor cancels out when taking the ratio. So the main factors are the distance a.

But wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5. But since A is the same for all, when we take the ratio of T4 to T2, the (1-A) terms will cancel. So the ratio is sqrt( R_star/(2a4) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). Because R_star is same, 2 cancels, and sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let's correct the formula. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the formula is T = T_eff * ( (L/(16πσ a²) ) )^0.25. But since L is the same for all planets, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (1/a^0.5), because sqrt(a) is in the denominator.

Wait, more precisely, the formula for equilibrium temperature, assuming a star like the Sun and circular orbit, is T = T_sun * sqrt( R_sun / (2a) ). Because more distance means lower temperature. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio of T4 to T2 would be sqrt(a2 / a4). Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So T4/T2 = (1/sqrt(a4))/(1/sqrt(a2)) )= sqrt(a2/a4). 

But wait, another approach: The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is T4 / T2 = ( (P4/(P2)) )^(-1/4) * ( (1 - A4)/(1 - A2) )^0.5. But since A is same, that part is 1. So it's (P4/P2)^(-1/4). Wait, but wait: orbital period is related to distance by Kepler's third law. 

Kepler's law says P² ∝ a³. Because P² = (4π²/G M) * a³. So a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Wait, so a4 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) * a2. Because if P increases, a increases. Because P is proportional to a^(3/2), so a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4 = a2 * (P4/P2)^(2/3).

But now, the ratio a2 / a4 = a2 / ( a2 * (P4/P2)^(2/3) ) ) = 1/(P4/P2)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So going back to T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Alternatively, since the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of a. So T ∝ 1/√a. Thus, T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4).

But the periods are given as a ratio: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1-5. Wait, planet 2 is the second in the list, so its period is 2. Planet 4 is third in the list, but wait, looking at the question, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5. So Planet_2 has P=2, Planet_4 has P=3.5.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So the ratio P2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.571. 

So putting it into the T ratio: T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). 

Wait, let me make sure. Wait, T ∝ (1/√a). So T4/T2 = (sqrt(a2) )/( sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2/a4 ).

But a4 = a2 * (P4/P2)^(2/3), since a ∝ P^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So sqrt( a2/a4 ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). 

So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.571. The cube root of 0.571.

What's the cube root of 0.571? Let me think. 0.8³ is 0.512, because 8^3=512. 0.82³ would be about 0.550, because (0.8)^3=0.512, 0.81^3=0.81*0.81=0.6561 *0.81 ≈ 0.531, 0.83^3? Let me compute 83^3= 571,787. So 83³=571787, so 0.83³ ≈ (83/100)^3 = (571787)/(1e6) )= 0.571787. So 0.83³ ≈ 0.571.

So cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83. So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Because T4 is the temperature of planet 4, and T2 is planet 2. So the ratio, T4 over T2, is around 0.83. So the equilibrium temperature of planet 4 is about 0.83 times that of planet 2. So the ratio is 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Using Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \( a \) is proportional to the cube of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{P_2^{2/3}}{P_4^{2/3}}} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

From the given orbital period ratios, Planet_2 has \( P_2 = 2 \) and Planet_4 has \( P_4 = 3.5 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{2}{3.5} \), we get \( \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \). The cube root of \( 0.571 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \), as \( 0.83^3 \approx 0.571 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Among the given options, the closest match is **C) ~0.83**.
