Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, what's the structure of a qubit in density matrix form? Oh right, a qubit's density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. For a pure state |ψ><ψ|, it would be a projector matrix with 1 in the direction of |ψ> and 0 elsewhere. But this ρ is a mixture. So let me compute it.

Each term is |n><n|, so |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0), and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (1,1). So adding them together, the diagonal elements would be 1 and 1, off-diagonal are 0. Then multiply by 1/2. So the matrix becomes:

[ 0.5 0 ]
[ 0 0.5 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], then multiplied by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]]. Right.

So the density matrix ρ is diagonal, with both diagonal elements equal to 0.5. Now, what does this represent geometrically?

I recall that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere. The Bloch vector r = (x, y, z) corresponds to the parameters in the general density matrix.

The general form of a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector.

So let's express our ρ in that form. Our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], which is (I * 0.5). So I + r·σ must be equal to I. Because when we factor out 0.5, it's (I)/2. So (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 implies that r·σ must be zero. Because I + r·σ = I → r·σ = 0. So the only possibility is that r is the zero vector.

Wait, because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ is rxσx + ryσy + rzσz. For this to be zero matrix, each coefficient must be zero. So rx=0, ry=
