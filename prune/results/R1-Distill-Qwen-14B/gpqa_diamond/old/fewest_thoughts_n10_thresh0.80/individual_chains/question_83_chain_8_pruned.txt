Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I'll try to remember.

So the problem says: we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction between them will produce the acetate ion and water.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the initial concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution.
2. Find out the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration and at equivalence.
3. For each case, determine whether it's a buffer solution or if we need to use some other method to find pH.
4. Use the appropriate formula (like Henderson-Hasselbalch or just the dissociation equation) to find the pH.

Starting with step 1: Diluting the acetic acid.

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L.

The molarity after dilution can be found using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, that's 0.025 M acetic acid after dilution.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, M1V1 is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then when diluted to 0.04 L, M2 is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, right, 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, the next step is the titration. The titrant is 0.1 M NaOH. So when we add a certain volume of NaOH, it will neutralize some of the acetic acid.

At 25% titration: I think this means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So first, let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Moles of acetic acid originally: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So the NaOH added will be 0.00025 moles because each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid.

Wait, wait, but wait. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. So yes, 1:1 molar ratio.

So moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.00025 moles.

The volume of NaOH used would be moles / Molarity = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. Not sure if I need that right now, but perhaps for later when considering equivalence point.

But for the pH at 25% titration, I need to figure out the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion in the solution.

Wait, let's think about the solution before adding any NaOH.
