Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mice. The setup is that they've engineered a construct to overexpress GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and are having trouble getting the protein expressed.

Looking at the plus strand sequence they provided, I should check for any issues that would prevent proper translation or expression.

First, let's think about the sequence. The construct includes a coding sequence with an HA tag. The HA tag is from the influenza hemagglutinin, and it's usually placed at the N-terminus. So the first few codons should code for the HA tag.

Wait, looking at the sequence provided, the very beginning is 5' ATG TAC ... So ATG is the start codon, which is methionine. The next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. That's the HA tag's first amino acid. Then comes CAT (which is histidine), then CGA (which is arginine). Wait, the HA tag is usually something like YPYDVPDY, right? Let me check: HA tag is HA, so maybe the DNA sequence would be TAC CAT CGA or something like that. But wait, the HA tag is a short peptide from the hemagglutinin, which starts with YPYDVPDY. So the DNA sequence would be TAC (Tyr), CAT (His), CGA (Arg), etc. So the first few codons are correct.

But wait, maybe the issue is a premature stop codon. If the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, but there's a stop codon in the HA sequence, that would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. Let me check the sequence.

Looking at the plus strand, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Oh wait, after the start codon, the sequence is TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (Stop). Wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh, wait a second, that's right after the HA tag. Let me recheck the exact sequence.

The first part is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... So, the start codon is ATG, then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (Stop). So the first 14 nucleotides after ATG would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.

Wait, that would mean the HA tag is only a few amino acids long before a stop codon. Because the HA tag is usually longer. For example, the HA tag is about 11 amino acids: YPYDVPDYDDV (I think). So the DNA would be TAC CAT CGT GCT GTA TAC CGA TAC CGT GCA TAA ACT TAC... something like that.

But in the provided sequence, after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (Stop). So that's only 10 codons after ATG, which would make the HA tag too short. Wait, the HA tag in the construct might be incorrect. Because the HA tag should start with Tyr, then His, then Arg, etc., but if in their construct, after the start codon, the first codon is Tyr, then Pro, then Tyr again, that doesn't match the HA tag. Alternatively, maybe the HA was inserted incorrectly, leading to a stop codon early on.

Wait, the HA tag is being added to the N-terminus. So the sequence should be the HA coding sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA tag is inserted incorrectly, perhaps a stop codon is introduced in the HA region
