Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is involved here. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron given the uncertainty in its position.

Let me read the problem again. The electron is moving at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. Wait, 0.1 nanometers is the same as 1e-10 meters, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m.

So, the problem is asking for the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. I think I need to use the Uncertainty Principle here. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. 

The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). But wait, how does that relate to energy uncertainty? Oh right, because the momentum p is related to the kinetic energy E. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So maybe I can express the uncertainty in energy in terms of Δp.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Find Δp using Δx and the uncertainty principle.
2. Use Δp to find ΔE, since ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum.

Wait, but how exactly? So, if Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, then the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in kinetic energy. So maybe I can approximate ΔE as (Δp²)/(2m), because the kinetic energy E is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty would be similar.

First, let's compute Δp. The uncertainty principle gives Δx * Δp ≈ h/(4π). So Δp ≈ h/(4πΔx). Let me remember the constants: Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. 

So plugging the numbers in: Δp ≈ (6.626e-34) / (4 * π * 1e-10). Let me calculate that denominator. 4 * π is about 12.566. So 12.566 * 1e-10 is 1.2566e-9. So 6.626e-34 divided by 1.2566e-9 equals approximately (6.626 / 1.2566) * 1e-25. Let me compute 6.626 / 1.2566. Hmm, 1.2566 is roughly 4/π, but more accurately, 6.626 / 1.2566 is about 5.28. So Δp ≈ 5.28e-25 kg·m/s. 

Wait, wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculation. Let me compute 6.626e-34 divided by (4 * π * 1e-10):

Compute 4 * π = 12.56637, so 4π * 1e-10 = 1.256637e-9 m.

So 6.626e-34 / 1.256637e-9 = (6.626 / 1.256637) * 1e-25. Let me calculate 6.626 / 1.256637: 

6.626 divided by 1.256637 is approximately 5.28 (since 1.256637 * 5 = 6.283, which is a bit less than 6.626, so maybe 5.28 is right.)

So Δp ≈ 5.28e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the next step is to find the uncertainty in energy ΔE. Since E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). So let's compute that.

The mass of the electron m is approximately 9.109e-31 kg. Plugging into the formula:

ΔE ≈ (5.28e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.109e-31)

Let me compute the numerator first: (5.28e-25)^2 = (5.28)^2 * 1e-50. 5.28 squared is about 27.8784, so 27.8784e-50 J²·s²/kg² or something? Hmm, but when we compute it, it's just 2.78784e-49. 

Wait, no: (5.28e-25)^2 is (5.28)^2 * (1e-25)^2 = 27.8784 * 1e-50. So 2.78784e-49 J² s²/(kg²), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's compute this as a number.

So numerator = (5.28e-25)^2 = 2.7878e-49.

Denominator: 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

So ΔE ≈ (2.7878e-49) / (1.8218e-30) )= (2.7878 / 1.8218) * 1e-19. 

Calculating 2.7878 / 1.8218 is approximately 1.53. So 1.53e-19 J.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that the correct approach? Because I think the uncertainty in energy is directly given by ΔE ≈ Δp²/(2m), but sometimes I remember that the uncertainty in energy can also be thought of in terms of the momentum uncertainty and the relation between energy and momentum. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the standard deviation in momentum leading to the standard deviation in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle gives the minimum uncertainty product for position and momentum. So Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). So I used that to find Δp.

Then, since E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Because if you take the derivative of E with respect to p, it's p/m. So the relative uncertainty in E would be roughly (Δp/p) * (p/m) ) = Δp/(m). But perhaps that's another way to approach it. Hmm, but maybe my initial calculation is correct.

Wait, let me make sure the approach is right. So, I have ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). Let me compute that.

Δp is about 5.28e-25 kg·m/s.

So (5.28e-25)^2 = (5.28)^2 = 27.8784, so 27.8784e-50 = 2.78784e-49.

Divide that by 2m, which is 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

So 2.78784e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = (2.78784 / 1.8218) * 1e-19.

2.78784 / 1.8218 is approximately 1.53, so 1.53e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, and option B is 1e-17, which is two orders higher. So 1.5e-19 J would be closest to option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this again. Could there be any other factors I'm missing, like a factor of 2 or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is ΔE ≈ (h^2)/(8m (Δx)^2). Because sometimes I've seen the uncertainty in kinetic energy derived as (h^2)/(8m (Δx)^2). Let me see.

Let me rederive this. The uncertainty in momentum, Δp, is h/(4πΔx). So, when we square that, (Δp)^2 = h²/(16 π² (Δx)^2). Then, ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m) = h²/(32 π² m (Δx)^2). 

Wait, but in the earlier approach, I used (h/(4πΔx))² / (2m) which is h²/(16 π² (Δx)^2 * 2 m) = h²/(32 π² m (Δx)^2).

Alternatively, taking another approach, perhaps the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ (h/(4πΔx))^2/(2m) ) = h²/(32 π² m (Δx)^2).

Let me compute this.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

32 π² is 32 * (9.8696) ≈ 315.827.

m is 9.109e-31 kg.

Δx is 1e-10 m, so (Δx)^2 is 1e-20 m².

So the denominator is 315.827 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1e-20 m².

Putting it all together: 4.39e-67 / (315.827 *9.109e-31 * 1e-20 )

Compute denominator: 315.827 *9.109e-31 = let's compute 315.827 *9.109 = approx 315*9=2835, but more accurately, 315.827 *9.109.

Let me compute 315 *9=2835, 315 *0.109=34.335. So approximate? Let's say 315*.109= approx 34.335. So 315.827 *9.109 ≈ 315.827 *9 = 2842.443, plus 315.827 *0.109 = approx 34.44. So total is around 2876.88. So 2876.88e-31.

Wait, no: 315.827 *9.109e-31 = (315.827 *9.109) * 1e-31.

So 315.827 *9.109 ≈ 315 *9=2835, 315 *0.109=34.335, 0.827 *9=7.443, 0.827 *0.109≈0.09.

Adding up: 2835 +34.335=2869.335, plus 7.443=2876.778, plus 0.09=2876.868. So 2876.868e-31. Now multiply by 1e-20: 2876.868e-31 *1e-20 = 2876.868e-51 = 2.876868e-48.

So numerator is 4.39e-67.

So 4.39e-67 / 2.876868e-48 = approx (4.39 / 2.876868) *1e-19. 

4.39 / 2.876868 is around 1.526. So 1.526e-19 J. Which is about 1.5e-19 J. So that's consistent with my initial calculation.

So the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.5e-19 Joules. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, option B is 1e-17 which is two orders higher. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the exponents. Because 1.5e-19 is in the same order as 1e-19, so option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the problem is about the uncertainty in energy due to the uncertainty in position. Oh, but that's what I did.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy can be written as p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy would be (Δp)²/(2m). But perhaps I should have used the average value of p, but I think the approach is correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, people use the relation between momentum and wavelength, but I don't think that's necessary here.

So yeah, I think the correct answer is option C, ~1e-19 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}
\]

Here, \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), and \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Solving for \( \Delta p \), we get:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta x}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4\pi \cdot 1 \times 10^{-10}} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.2566 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.28 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

Next, the uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) by the kinetic energy formula:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}
\]

Here, \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting \( \Delta p \):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5.28 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(5.28 \times 10^{-25})^2 = (5.28)^2 \cdot (10^{-25})^2 = 27.8784 \cdot 10^{-50} = 2.78784 \times 10^{-49}
\]

Now, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} = 1.8218 \times 10^{-30}
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{2.78784 \times 10^{-49}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} = \left( \frac{2.78784}{1.8218} \right) \cdot 10^{-19} \approx 1.53 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

This value is closest to \( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option C. The other options are either too large or too small by orders of magnitude.
