Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one matches the given spectral data.

First, let me read the information again. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. A broad peak here suggests that the compound has an -OH group, probably from a carboxylic acid because those have strong, broad O-H stretches.

Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a region where carbonyl groups (like C=O) absorb. So the compound likely has a carbonyl, and since the O-H is present, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So the structure probably ends with a COOH group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: several signals, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or at least no protons adjacent to double bonds. That means it's probably a saturated molecule, maybe with branching.

Now, looking at the splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complicated. Let me think about what that implies. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. The more neighbors, the more splitting. So a quartet suggests three neighboring Hs. A triplet suggests two Hs. A doublet would be one neighbor. So when you have a doublet of triplets, it's like each H is split by two different sets of neighboring Hs.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Let's look at the options.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like CH2CH2 groups attached to a central CH, then CH2COOH. Wait, actually, more accurately, it's a symmetrical structure. The central part is CH connected to two ethyl groups and another CH connected to two ethyl groups, then a CH2 and COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each connected to an ethyl group and a methyl group. Then a COOH at the end.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each attached to two methyl groups. Then a CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Here, the central part is two CH groups, each connected to a methyl and an ethyl group. Then a COOH.

Wait, perhaps the structures are similar but with varying substituents. Let me think about the NMR signals. Since there are no vinyl protons, all
