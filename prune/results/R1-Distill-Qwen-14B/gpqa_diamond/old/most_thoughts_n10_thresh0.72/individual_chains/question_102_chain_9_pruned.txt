Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetic construct and why the green signal isn't showing up in the mice. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: there's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the vector has two genes, the ligand and the receptor. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Both are under different promoters? Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh right, IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed as a separate transcript but from the same vector or something.

Wait, no, bicistronic vectors often have two ORFs in a single transcript. So maybe the ligand is under a promoter, and then the receptor is after an IRES, which allows for the translation of the second ORF. So the construct would be something like: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop with loxP -> then IRES -> receptor ORF -> stop with lox2272. And each is fused to their respective fluorescent proteins.

Then, the vector is designed so that when Cre is present, the stops are removed. So the loxP and lox2272 sites flank the stops. Cre recombinase will recognize these sites and excise the stops, allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed. So, without Cre, the proteins are not expressed because of the stops. But in the presence of Cre, like in mice that have the Cre transgene, the stops are removed, and the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the question, they've bred a mouse model that's homozygous for their construct in the wild-type background. Then they crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the SOX10-Cre would provide the Cre enzyme, right? Because SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think, which is where the ligand and receptor are initially expressed.

So the F1 offspring would have the construct and the Cre. So the Cre should excise the stops, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. So when they look under the confocal, they should see either red (mCherry) and green (eGFP) signals, depending on where each is expressed. But in this case, they don't see green. Hmm.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how this affects the Western blot or the expression. Maybe if they're secreted, but the question is about expression in the mouse. Maybe the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on the cell surface. But the problem is about the eGFP not showing up. So if the construct isn't expressed, the eGFP wouldn't be there. But why would paracrine cause that? Not sure.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not transported to the cell surface, so no eGFP signal. But why would that happen? If the construct is properly made, the signal peptide (if any) should direct it to the Golgi and then to the cell surface. If the eGFP is not correctly processed, maybe the stop codon is in the wrong place. But wait, the vector is designed to have the stop cassette, which is removed by Cre. If the stop is still present, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But in the experiment, the Cre is present, so the stops should be gone. So maybe the eGFP is not correctly tagged, like a frame shift. Or perhaps the vector isn't allowing proper expression.
