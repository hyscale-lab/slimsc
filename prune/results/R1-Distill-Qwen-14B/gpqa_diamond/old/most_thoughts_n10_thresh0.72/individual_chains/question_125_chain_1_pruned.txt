Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that there's a particle of mass m moving in a three-dimensional isotropic potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator. So this is a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator. The question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I remember that for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, each energy level depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, in 3D, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n, but wait, no. Let me think again. In 3D, the potential is separable into x, y, z directions, each a 1D harmonic oscillator. So the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

Each 1D harmonic oscillator has energy levels given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is 0,1,2,... So in 3D, the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, the sum n_x + n_y + n_z is often denoted by another quantum number, say N. So N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

The third excited state... Wait, I need to clarify what 'third excited state' means. In quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is the first state. The first excited state is the next one, then the second, and so on. So the third excited state would be the fourth energy level.

Wait, no. Let me get that right. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is the zeroth excited state. The first excited state is the next one, so the third excited state would be the fourth level. But wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

In 3D, the energy depends on N, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers. The possible N values start at 0 (ground state), then 1, 2, etc. Each N corresponds
