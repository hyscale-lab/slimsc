Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let me read it again and break it down step by step.

So, the question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. I remember that HPLC can separate components based on their interaction with the stationary phase. Normal-phase HPLC is usually silica-based, which is polar, so polar molecules elute later. Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase, so they separate enantiomers into different peaks.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's lithium aluminum hydride. It usually reduces ketones to alcohols. So, the ketone group in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one will be reduced. The structure is (S) configuration on the 5th carbon, which has a methoxy group. So, the carbonyl at C3 would be reduced to a CH2OH group. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, the structure would be something like:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the carbonyl is at position 3. When reduced, that becomes CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-OCH3-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the starting molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-OCH3-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon. So, when you reduce the carbonyl (C=O) at position 3, you add two hydrogens. So, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product of Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Because LAH is a strong reducing agent and would completely reduce the ketone. Then, acidic workup would protonate any remaining groups but in this case, the product is an alcohol.

Wait, but wait, is the starting material a ketone? Yes, hexan-3-one. So after reduction, it becomes 3-hexanol, but with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon. So the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since the starting material is an S configuration, and the reduction doesn't change the stereochemistry because the carbonyl group is being reduced to an alcohol. Wait, no, the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol doesn't involve any stereochemistry because the carbonyl is trigonal planar. So the product would be a secondary alcohol, and the configuration at C5 (the methoxy group) is still S. Wait, but the configuration in the starting material is S at C5, and
