Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options (A, B, C, D), each with a sequence of reactions. I need to determine which sequence leads to the desired product with a high yield.

First, I'll try to draw the target molecule to visualize what's needed. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are numbered such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Alternatively, since benzene is symmetric, I should think about the substituents' order and their directing effects.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the numbering might not be as important as the substituents' positions relative to each other. Let me think about the substituents:

- The nitro group is a strong meta-directing group.
- Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
- tert-Butyl is a bulky, activating, but it's a strong para/ortho director because it's an alkyl group, but being bulky, it might favor para substitution more.

So, the target molecule has substituents in specific positions, which are directed by the directing effects of the groups present at each substitution step.

The synthesis starts with benzene. The goal is to attach these three groups in the correct order to get the right positions.

I think the key is the order of substitution steps. Because each substituent directs where the next will go, the order is crucial.

So, let's outline the steps needed.

1. Introduce one substituent first. Let's say we start with the nitro group. Nitration is a common first step. But wait, nitro is a meta director. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced first because it's activating, which would be better for subsequent substitutions.

Wait, benzene is activated by groups like ethoxy (which is activating) and deactivated by nitro (deactivating). So, if we have an activating group first, we can then add deactivating groups, but the order matters because each new substituent directs the next.

Alternatively, maybe we need to nitrate first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl, but I'm not sure. Let's think.

Wait, the target has nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl. Let me number the ring in a way that makes sense. Let's imagine the ring has the nitro group at position 3, ethoxy at position 1, and tert-butyl at position 2. But that's just the numbering; the actual positions are relative.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to plan the order of substituents based on their directing effects and the desired positions.

Let me think about the substituents:

- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3): activating, ortho/para director.
- tert-butyl: activating, but bulky, so
