Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, first, let's parse the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They want the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Then, during titration with a strong base, the pH increases. The equivalence point is where moles of base equal moles of acid.

Let me break it down into parts. First, the initial dilution before titration.

The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. The volume is 20 cm³. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid. Right, because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, concentration is (moles)/(volume). The original moles are (0.05 mol/L) * (0.02 L) = 0.001 mol. After adding 0.02 L water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

So, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is 25% titration. Then, the equivalence point.

Let me handle each part one by one.

First, what's 25% titration? That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, we have to find the pH at that point.

Second, at the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions, which will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic. So the pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

Let me tackle the 25% titration first.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (which gives CH3COO^- and water).

Let me calculate the moles involved.

The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH has reacted with NaOH. So, the remaining moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume at this point is important. But wait, we added some NaOH. How much?

Let me think. The amount of NaOH added is 25% of the required to reach equivalence.

The moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol (since it's 1:1 with acetic acid). So, moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.00025 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, volume of NaOH used is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So, the total solution volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is the initial diluted volume (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So now, in this 42.5 cm³ solution, we have:

- CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol
- CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ Wait, wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Wait, log(1.85) is about
