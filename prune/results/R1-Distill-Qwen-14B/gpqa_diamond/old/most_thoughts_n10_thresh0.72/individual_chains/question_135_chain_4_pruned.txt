Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a boson. The question is about which decay channels are kinematically allowed for the boson X at the lowest order. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that for a particle to decay into another pair of particles, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the heaviest particle in the decay products. Because each particle in the pair must have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So the key here is the mass of the boson X, which is 6 GeV.

The decay options given are various fermion-antifermion pairs. So I need to figure out which of these pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

I'll list out the possible decay products and their masses. Let me think about the masses of each fermion:

- Electron (e^-): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ^-): about 0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ^-): around 1.78 GeV.
- Up quark (u): approximately 2 MeV, so 0.002 GeV.
- Down quark (d): around 4-5 MeV, so about 0.004-0.005 GeV.
- Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV, 0.1 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.27 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.1-4.7 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. But the boson here is only 6 GeV, so t can't be a decay product.

Wait, but the decay products are like quark-antiquark pairs, right? So each quark's mass would be considered. But when particles are produced, especially in pair production, the mass threshold is twice the mass of the particle, since you create a quark and antiquark.

Wait, but for bosons like the photon or Z boson, which are neutral, the decay into quark-antiquark pairs depends on their mass and the masses of the quarks.

So for each possible decay channel, I need to check if 2*m_fermion <= m_X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where 2*m_fermion <=6 GeV can be a possible decay channel.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Wait, the b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So twice that is about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b bbar is not possible. So A can't be the correct option because it includes b decay, which is not allowed.

Option B: X→c cbar, s s
