Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The question gives four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions would give the desired product in high yield.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, position 5 has a nitro group, and there's a ketone group (ethan-1-one implies a ketone at position 1, which is the same as the benzene ring's position 1, so the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ketone is at position 1. So the phenyl ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon of ethan-1-one, so the ring is in position 1. Then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that point. So the ring has a bromo group at position 3 and nitro at position 5.

So the substituents are meta to each other on the benzene ring, with the ketone group (ethan-1-one) attached at position 1.

So starting from benzene, I need to introduce a ketone group, then bromine and nitro groups in the correct positions.

Wait, or maybe the ketone is part of the substituent. Let me think again. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? Wait no, ethan-1-one is CH3C(O)CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (propan-2-one), but the numbering is different. Oh wait, ethan-1-one would be CH3CO- something. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that ethan-1-one is (CH3)COCH2â€“, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the formula would be C(O)CH2CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think. Ethan-1-one is a ketone, so the carbonyl is between two carbon atoms. So maybe it's (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, but acetone is propan-2-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's ethyl group attached to a ketone. Wait, ethan-1-one would be a two-carbon chain with the ketone at position 1. So it's O=C-CH2-CH3? No, that would be impossible because the carbonyl can't be at the end. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, the IUPAC name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)eth
