Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct chemical formula for this unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak in this region usually indicates the presence of either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (like amines). Since the options don't have any nitrogen, I'll assume it's O-H. But wait, the peak is very broad. Broad peaks for O-H are typically seen in carboxylic acids or maybe even in alcohols, but sometimes alcohols can have broad peaks too, especially if they're hydrogen-bonded. But another thing I should note is the other peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an ester because esters have two carbonyls? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have an alkene group somewhere. That makes me think of structures like alkenes or maybe something with an aromatic ring, but the options don't have benzene, so probably just a simple alkene.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what gives a molecular ion fragment of 45. Common fragments at m/z 45 include things like CH3CO (acetate group) because 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CO (12*2 + 1*3 +16 = 45? Wait 12*2 is 24, H3 is 3, 16 is 16... 24+3=27 +16=43? Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, CH3CO is C2H3O2? No, wait. Acetate is CH3COO- which has a molecular weight of 60? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another possibility is that 45 is an ethyl group or something. Or maybe it's the tropylium ion (C7H7), but that's higher. Alternatively, the fragment could be the result of losing a larger group. For instance, in an ester, maybe the ester group breaks off. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, maybe some cleavage occurs.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So looking at the degrees of unsaturation. For each formula, let's calculate
