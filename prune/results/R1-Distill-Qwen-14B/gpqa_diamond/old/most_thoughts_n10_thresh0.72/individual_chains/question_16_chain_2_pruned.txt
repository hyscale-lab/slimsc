Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's chirality in the moleculeâ€”so, it has a chiral center or some kind of stereoisomerism that's not meso.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is at position 1-ene, so it's 1,2-dichloro? No, wait, wait. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, I think I'm getting confused. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Oh wait, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH3? Wait no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it (CH3)2C=CH2? Wait, no, but it's 1-chloro, so the Cl is on the first carbon. So structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So like Cl-CR2=C-R', where R groups are arranged. Wait, the molecule would be Cl attached to a carbon that's double-bond
