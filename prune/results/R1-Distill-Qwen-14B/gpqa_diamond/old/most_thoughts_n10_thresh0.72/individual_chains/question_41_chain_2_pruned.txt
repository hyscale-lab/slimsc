Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling through a moving glass. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when things move, especially at high speeds, you have to consider relativity, but wait, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, right? But this is about a glass medium, so the index of refraction comes into play. Let me break it down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. But wait, the light is inside the glass, so its speed relative to the glass would be c/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c divided by n. So v_light_relative_to_glass = c/n.

But the glass is moving at velocity v, so I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame. So, I think this is a case of adding velocities, but Newtonian or relativistic? Oh, but the speeds involved are probably non-relativistic, since the problem doesn't mention relativity, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, in Newtonian mechanics, velocities add up linearly. So if the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at (c/n) relative to the glass, then the lab frame would see the speed as v + (c/n). But wait, wait, no. Because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of light relative to the glass.

Wait, but if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, then the light is moving towards the observer as well. So the light's speed in the lab frame is the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed in the glass's frame.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the
