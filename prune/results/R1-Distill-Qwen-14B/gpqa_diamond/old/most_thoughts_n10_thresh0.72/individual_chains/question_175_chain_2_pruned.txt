Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can radiate electromagnetic waves. The question is a bit complex, but let's break it down.

Alright, the setup: it's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis.

The question is asking two things: what's the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and what form does f take. The options are A, B, C, D combinations.

I think I remember that the radiation pattern from a dipole has a specific angular dependence. Dipole radiation typically falls off with θ as 1/(something with sin or cos). Wait, wait. Let me recall: The power radiated by a dipole varies with the angle θ as (sin θ)^2, right? So the radiation is maximum along the equator (θ=90 degrees) and minimum along the poles (θ=0 and 180). Wait no, wait, I might have mixed that up. Wait, no, dipole radiation has maximum at θ=90 degrees because that's where the electric field is strongest. So the radiation pattern is proportional to sin²θ.

So f, the function of θ, should be proportional to sin²θ. But in the options, I don't see any directly involving sinθ. Wait, the options give functional forms in terms of λ. Oh wait, that's different. So the function f is a function of θ and λ. So maybe the power per unit solid angle depends on both.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum power fraction at a specific θ. The maximum power is A. So I need to find the fraction of A that is radiated at θ=30 degrees.

So let's think about the angular dependence. If the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²θ, then the maximum would be when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. But wait, wait, the maximum of sinθ is 1 at 90 degrees. So if the power per unit solid angle is highest
