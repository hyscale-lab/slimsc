Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, what's that structure look like? Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, right? So, it's like a bridged bicyclic compound with two rings: a five-membered and a three-membered ring, I think. The numbering is important here.

The substituents are at positions 1 and 4. The 2-azabicyclo part means there's a nitrogen in the structure. Wait, actually, 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So, the nitrogen is at position 2. And there's a vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-) attached to position 2 as well because it's 2-vinyl.

So the structure is a norbornene (since there's a double bond) with a nitrogen at position 2, and a vinyl group attached there. Let me try to draw this mentally.

Norbornene has a bridge, and the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 (if I count correctly). Wait, no, the double bond is in the five-membered ring. Oh, wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6? Or maybe between 5 and 6 in the five-membered ring? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6, making one of the rings a five-membered with a double bond. And the nitrogen is at position 2, which is one of the bridgeheads, perhaps.

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene: the heptane has seven carbons. The bridges are two, two, and one carbons. So the structure is like two five-membered rings? No, wait, bicyclo[2.2.1] is a norbornane structure. So two bridges: one
