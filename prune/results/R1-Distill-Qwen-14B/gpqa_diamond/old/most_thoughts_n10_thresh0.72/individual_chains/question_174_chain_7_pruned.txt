Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions because of conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me break down the given data:
- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So, E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: mass ratio 2:1. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2.
- Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because sum is 99% of initial mass.

Wait, no, the initial mass is M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation:
2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial mass M has rest energy 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. So the rest energies of the fragments are m1 c² and m2 c².

So m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

But wait, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So yes, that fits:
