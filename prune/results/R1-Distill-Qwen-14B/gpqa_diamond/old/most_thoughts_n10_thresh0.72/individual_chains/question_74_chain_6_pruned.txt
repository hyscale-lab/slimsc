Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my half-life concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We have an atom that has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we're being asked for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D, with various percentages.

Wait, I think this is about the exponential decay formula. Oh right, radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The key here is that the decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the fact that 50 minutes have gone by and it hasn't decayed doesn't change the probability for the future.

Hmm, but wait. The initial probability given is 32% over 100 minutes. I think I need to relate this to the decay constant. The formula I remember is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant, t is time. The probability of decay is 1 - N(t)/N0, right? So the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, so if the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, that's 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Solving for λ would give us the decay constant.

Let me work that out. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural logs on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, what's ln(0.68)? I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less. Let me approximate. Let's say ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857 because I remember that ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.7) is around -0.3567, so for 0.68, maybe it's about -0.3857. So λ would be 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the question is, what's the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 150 minutes from when? Oh, wait, the 50 minutes have already passed, so the remaining time is 150 minutes. But does the decay process take into account the initial 100? Or is the next 150 minutes starting from the current time?

Hmm, the way the question is phrased: "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes." So the next 150 minutes after the 50 that have already passed. So the total time from now is 150 minutes. Because the decay process is memoryless, the probability depends only on the time that's left.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the total time since the beginning, but I don't think so. Because the 50 minutes have passed without decay. But in reality, the decay is independent of past events, so the probability should only depend on the time remaining.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial 100 minutes had a 32% probability. Now, 50 minutes have passed, so the remaining time is 50 minutes. Wait, no, the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So from the current moment, the time considered is 150 minutes.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the decay probability over a given time
