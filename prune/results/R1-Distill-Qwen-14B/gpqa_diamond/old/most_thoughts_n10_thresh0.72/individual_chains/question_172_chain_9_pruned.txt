Alright, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down. I remember that this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas to the temperature. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The population ratio of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. So, if N1 and N2 are the populations of two energy levels, then N1/N2 equals (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, in this problem, it's the same energy level in both stars, so g1 and g2 would be the same, right? Because they're the same transition for iron. So the ratio of the populations would just depend on the temperatures of the stars. 

But wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, N1 is twice N2, where N2 would be the population of star_2 for the same energy level. Or maybe I should think of it as the ratio N1/N2 = 2. Because star_1's population is twice star_2's.

Wait, no, actually, the question is about the excitation being twice as much. So N (excited state) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So N1/N2 = 2.

But wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, because E is the energy difference ΔE = E1 - E2, so in the exponent it's -ΔE/(kT).

So putting it all together, the ratio N1/N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) * (g1/g2). But since the same element and same transition, g1 and
