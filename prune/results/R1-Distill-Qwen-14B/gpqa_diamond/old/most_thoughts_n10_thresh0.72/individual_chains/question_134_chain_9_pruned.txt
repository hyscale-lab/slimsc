Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when these are combined. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I should pay attention to the units.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of H+ reacting with OH- to form water. The standard value is about -57 kJ/mol, but that's for strong acids and strong bases. But in this case, we have different acids and a base, so I need to calculate the moles involved.

First, I should probably figure out how many moles of H+ and OH- are present in each solution. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with HCl: HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So for 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) of 0.2 M HCl, the moles of HCl (and thus H+) are: Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So for 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M H2SO4, moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives 2 H+, the total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then we've got Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So for 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2, moles are 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives two OH-, so OH- moles are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait: when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So the total H+ is from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- is from Ba(OH)2.

So total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

But here, the OH- is less than H+—0.2 vs 0.28. So OH- is the limiting reactant. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water.

Now, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for neutralization is typically -57 kJ per mole of H+ reacting. But wait, I should double-check—some sources say it's per mole of H2O formed. Since each mole of H+ gives one mole of H2O, yes, 0.2 moles would produce 0.2 moles of H2O, so the ΔH would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but I see the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. Let me look again at the options. Option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Oh wait, the question is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. So if it's per mole, but maybe the problem expects the total enthalpy change for the reaction as given.

Wait, another thought: when you mix these solutions, the total amount of acid and base might not all react. Since H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2, only 0.2 moles of each will react. The remaining 0.08 moles of H+ will remain, but since there's no more OH- to react, they don't contribute to the neutralization.

So the total heat released is for 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting. So 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see -11.4 kJ, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmmm, there's a unit discrepancy.

Wait, I need to check if I should be using kcal or kJ. Oh, wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol, so if the problem asks for the answer in kJ, but one of the options is in kcal, I might have to convert.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184
