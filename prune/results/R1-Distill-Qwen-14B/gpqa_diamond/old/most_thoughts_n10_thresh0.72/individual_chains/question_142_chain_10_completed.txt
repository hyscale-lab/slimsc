Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space among the given options.

Wait, what's a density matrix again? Oh right, it's a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of states) rather than a pure state. The density matrix must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have a trace of 1.

So, the given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write that out more explicitly. Each term |i⟩⟨i| is a projector, so |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere, and same for |1⟩⟨1| but in (1,1). Adding them together and multiplying by 1/2 would give a matrix where (0,0)=1/2, (1,1)=1/2, and all other elements are 0. So ρ looks like:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, that's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Or is it a maximally mixed state? Oh yes, because for a qubit, the maximally mixed state has equal probabilities for both states, so that's exactly what this is. So the density matrix is maximally mixed.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, what's the geometrical representation of a density matrix? I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, specifically the Bloch sphere. Right, the Bloch vector or Bloch sphere representation.

The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's on the surface of the sphere, and for a mixed state, it's inside. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. Let me recall the formula.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector with components (x, y, z), which corresponds to the Bloch vector. The magnitude of r must be ≤1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1.

So, let's express the given ρ in this form. Our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that.

First, the identity matrix I is:

[ [1, 0],
  [0, 1] ]

The Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

Let me see. Our given ρ is:

(1/2) [ [1, 0],
          [0, 1] ] 

Which is (I)/2. So setting ρ equal to (I + r·σ)/2, we have:

(I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 → I = I + r·σ → r·σ = 0.

So each component of r must be zero. Because if r is (0,0,0), then r·σ is zero matrix. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because a completely mixed state would be at the center.

Wait, let me think again. For a pure state |0⟩, the density matrix is |0⟩⟨0|. In terms of the Bloch sphere, that would correspond to r pointing along the z-axis, so (0,0,1). Similarly, |1⟩ would be (0,0,-1), but wait, no, actually, wait. Because the Bloch vector for |0⟩ is (0,0,1), and |1⟩ is (0,0,-1). But in our case, the density matrix is an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, so it has the same as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. So the Bloch vector is zero, at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation, where any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The magnitude of \(\mathbf{r}\) must satisfy \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\).

For the given \(\rho\), expanding it explicitly yields:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is equivalent to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, corresponding to the origin of the Bloch sphere. This makes sense because the given state is a maximally mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different state.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\).  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid density matrix for a single qubit.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
