Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I think is ethyl methanesulfonate, a chemical mutagen that causes point mutations. So, they've created several mutants, and we're looking at the sequences of the target gene in each mutant to find out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, and there are four mutants (1-4). I need to look at each mutant's sequence and determine which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function, particularly leading to the production of a non-functional protein or preventing the compound's synthesis.

Hmm, so the idea is that the mutation should cause a premature stop codon or a frameshift, or maybe disrupt a critical region of the protein. Alternatively, a silent mutation wouldn't help. But looking at the sequences, I should compare them to the wild type.

Let me look at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at this, the first exon starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Comparing the wild type and mutant 1, I see a change in the third and fourth nucleotides. Wild type is TTT, while mutant 1 has TCT. Wait, let me count: the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT..., mutant 1 is ATG TTC TAC GCT... So let's see, positions:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT ...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT ... 

So, the second codon in wild type is TTT (which is Phe), and in mutant 1, it's TTC (still Phe, since TTC is also Phe). Wait, that's a point mutation but same amino acid. Then, the third codon in wild type is CTC (Leu), and in mutant 1 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Leu to Tyr. Not a frameshift, so it's a missense mutation. But does that change cause a problem? It depends on whether that amino acid is crucial. But I'm not sure yet. Let me look further.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So again, starting from the beginning. First, ATG is the same. Then, TTT in wild type becomes TCT in mutant 2 (so second codon is TTC vs TCT? Wait, no. Wait, let me parse the sequences correctly.

The wild type is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so the wild type's second codon is TTT (Phe), and mutant 2's is TTC (also Phe). So same amino acid. Then the third codon in wild is CTC (Leu), mutant 2 it's TAA. Wait, TAA is a stop codon! Oh wait, no: TAA is a stop codon. So in mutant 2, after the second codon (TTC), the third codon is TAA, which is stop. That would cause a premature termination. So the protein would be shorter. If the anti-nutritional compound is made by the entire protein
