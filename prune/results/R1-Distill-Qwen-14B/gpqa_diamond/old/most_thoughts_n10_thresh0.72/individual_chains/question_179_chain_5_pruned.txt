Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question gives me four matrices, W, X, Y, Z, and asks which statement about them is correct. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to measurable quantities. Also, the evolution operator is unitary, which means its conjugate transpose multiplied by itself equals the identity matrix.

So, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. e^X is the matrix exponential of X. For the norm to change, e^X must not be unitary. Because if an operator is unitary, multiplying a vector by it preserves the norm. So, I need to check if e^X is unitary.

Wait, but e^X is unitary only if X is skew-Hermitian. Because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. So, if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary, meaning it preserves the norm for any vector. If X isn't skew-Hermitian, then e^X isn't unitary, so the norm could change.

So, what's X? Let me look at matrix X. The question gives X as:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

Wait, to check if X is skew-Hermitian (X† = -X), I need to compute its conjugate transpose and see if it equals -X.

The conjugate transpose of X, X†, is:
(-i)*, 1*, (2i)* → (-i, 1, -2i)
(-1)*, 0*, (-1)* → (-1, 0, -1)
(2i)*, 1*, (-i)* → (-2i, 1, i)

Wait, no, let me do it correctly. Each element (i,j) becomes (j,i) with complex conjugation.

So, original X:
Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [2i, -1, -i]

X† will have rows as columns, with each element conjugated.

So X†:

First row of X is [i, -1, 2i], so first column of X† is [i*, (-1)*, (2i)*] which is [-i, -1, -2i]

Second row of X is [1,0,1], so second column is [1*, 0*, 1*] → [1,0,1]

Third row of X is [2i, -1, -i], so third column is [2i*, (-1)*, (-i)*] → [-2i, -1, i]

So X† is:

[ -i   1    -2i ]
[ -1    0     -1 ]
[ -2i  1       i ]

Wait, let me write it as a matrix:

X†:
Row 1: -i , 1 , -2i
Row 2: -1 , 0 , -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i 

Now, let's compute -X. X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row3: 2i, -1, -i

So -X would be:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2: -1, 0
