Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound mostly looks as expected, except for two peaks that are both the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So, they're integrating to a single proton total. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Hmm.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two clear peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So, the mass is the same, but the LC shows two peaks.

What could be causing this?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with precursor. Well, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected compound. If it was a precursor, the mass would likely be different, right? Because the precursor would have a lower mass, perhaps. Also, NMR doesn't directly show the presence of a precursor unless it's a co-eluting impurity. Not sure yet.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would lead to the same mass in LC-MS because they have the same molecular weight. In LC, if the column is chiral, they might separate, but if it's a regular column, they might elute together. Wait, the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks. So if the LC is a normal column (like reversed phase), enantiomers wouldn't separate. Unless the mobile phase conditions are such that they are separated, but I'm not sure. Also, in NMR, enantiomers would give the same spectrum because they're mirror images. So why are there two peaks for the same alpha proton? Enantiomers wouldn't cause that because the NMR would look identical. So this might not explain it. 

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Double coupling in the context of amide bonds... maybe when two amide bonds form in a way that creates two different coupling partners? Or perhaps it's related to diastereomers, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, double coupling refers to something like when a proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, but the question says it's ruled out by the coupling pattern. So maybe this option isn't the right fit.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR spectra and potentially separate on LC. Wait, but in the NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. But the question says that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. That suggests that the two peaks are from two different environments of the same proton.

Wait, but how does that happen? If the molecule is a diastereomer, the alpha-proton would be in a different environment, leading to a different chemical shift. But in this case, the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. Hmm. Also, the integrals add up to 1H. So they're probably two different environments of the same proton from two different isomeric forms.

Wait, the molecule could have some kind of symmetry or another aspect. Alternatively, maybe it's a question of amide isomerism. For example, in an amide, the nitrogen can have different configurations, leading to different diastereomers. If that's the case, then the alpha protons would split into different shifts. Wait, but why would two peaks appear for the same proton? Because each diastereomer has that same proton in a slightly different environment.

Wait, but if the molecule exists as a mixture of diastereomers, then each would have their own set of signals. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks where the same alpha proton looks different in each situation. So for each diastereomer, the alpha proton would be in a different environment, leading to a different chemical shift. So the NMR would show two separate signals for that proton, each integrating to 1H each, but together 2H? Wait, no, the question says that together they integrate to 1H. Oh wait, the question says, "they integrate to 1H - the expected integral". So each peak must be integrating to 0.5H each? That seems odd because protons are quantized, but maybe it's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps each diastereomer has a single alpha proton that gives a singlet, and when you have a 50:50 mixture, each contributes 0.5H, adding up to 1H. But wait, that would only be the case if each diastereomer has one of those protons, which is the case
