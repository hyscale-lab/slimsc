Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectral data. Let me take it step by step.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me start by calculating the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n +2 - m -x -y)/2. Wait, n is the number of carbons. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2 (two oxygens), y=1 (one nitrogen). Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2 = 3. So DoU is 3. That could be a combination of a ring and double bonds. Like maybe one ring and one double bond, or three rings, etc. But more likely, a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU on its own, since benzene has three double bonds) plus maybe an amide or ester group.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group, like an amide, ester, or maybe a ketone. But in the options, I see amides and esters, so that fits.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group as a triplet, so an ethyl group attached to something that splits the triplet. Like an ethoxy group or an ethyl ester.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an NH2 group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Wait, but the compound has one N. Let me think. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which has an NH2 group. So the N-H protons could be in a broad signal. But in the NMR, it's at 4.0, which is a bit higher than typical NH2 in aromatic amines, which are usually around 1-5 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Wait, OCH2 could be a singlet, but I'm not certain. Or perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.

Then at 4.5 ppm, a quartet (q), 2H. Quartet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2, which is split into a quartet. Like in an ethyl ester group, where the CH2 connected to oxygen is a quartet. For example, in ethyl groups where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm is probably the OCH2CH2 group, but wait, ethyl esters usually have the CH2 next to oxygen as a quartet. Wait, in ethyl acetate, for example, the CH2CH3 would be a quartet at around 4.1 ppm. Hmm, but this is at 4.5, a bit upfield. Alternatively, maybe it's a neighboring group with more electron-withdrawing.

Then the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, the doublets each have 2H, so maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, each causing two equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but that would give a different splitting. Wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene, the protons would typically be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Like in para-substituted benzene with two groups in the para positions. Hmm, but wait, that's not possible because if it's para, the substituents would be opposite each other. Maybe the substituents are in the para position, but each substituent has two protons. Or perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted ring where each substituent is a group that deactivates the ring and causes the protons to split into doublets.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic region shows two doublets: one at 7.0 and another at 8.0. So that suggests maybe two substituents which are ortho to each other, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, it's a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, each causing their own doublets. Or perhaps it's a meta substitution, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro group or an amino group attached para to another group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide is a benzene ring with an amide group. So the substituents would be at positions 3 (ethoxy) and 1 (amide). Wait, but in that case, the aromatic protons would be more complex.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide is HCONH- attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the substituents are at positions 4 (ethoxy) and the formamide group at position 1 (para). So the ring would be 4-ethoxy and the formamide in the para position. So the ring would have two substituents. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets: the H ortho to the formamide and the H meta to the ethoxy would split into certain peaks. Alternatively, maybe the ring has substituents in the para positions, leading to two doublets. 

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with NH2 at position 4 and a propionate group (which is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3?) Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO- so the structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Or wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the molecular formula for each option.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's compute each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Then adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would add C2H5O. So total would be C9H10NO2? Wait, benzamide is C7H5NO2. Oh wait, let me think. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2, which is C7H7NO2. Then adding eth
