Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their probabilities of transiting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to observe the one more likely to transit because they have limited time. Both are detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and their orbits are circular. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Wait, that's interesting. So even though one star is more massive, their radii are the same. Hmm.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. But wait, when a planet transits, it has to pass in front of the star from our perspective. The probability depends on the size of the planet (or, more accurately, the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size) and the orbital distance.

Wait, no, I think the main factor here is the planet's orbital distance. Because the transit probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is closer to our line of sight. So the probability is approximately (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planet is Earth-like and the star is much bigger, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So P~ (R_star)/(a).

But wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, because it's the area of the star relative to the planet's path. Wait, actually, I think the probability is P = (R_star / a)^2, but only if the planet's orbit is edge-on. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbital path. So it's (2R_star) / (2a)
