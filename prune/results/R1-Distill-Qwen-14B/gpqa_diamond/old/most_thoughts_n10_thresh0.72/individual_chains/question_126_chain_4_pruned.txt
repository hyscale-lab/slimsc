Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist, and then analyzing the results using HPLC. The options are about how many peaks show up in the chromatograms. Alright, let's take it slow.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. Let me draw the structure to visualize.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a six-carbon chain. The ketone is at position 3, so the structure is (CH₂)₂CO-(CH₂)₂-OCH3. Wait, no, let me correct that. Hexan-3-one would be CH₂CH₂CO in the third position. So the structure is CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-OCH3, but with the stereochemistry at the 5th carbon being S. Hmm, but wait, is the methoxy group on the fifth carbon? Let me think. Hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So positions are: 1, 2, 3 (carbonyl), 4, 5, 6. So the methoxy is on carbon 5, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. So yeah, the structure is (S)-configuration at C5.

When LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is used, it's a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones. So the ketone group (C=O) becomes a CH₂OH group, wait no, wait. Wait, LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a CH₂-OH group? Wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl is in the ketone, so it's a ketone. Reduction of ketone with LAH would turn the carbonyl into CH-OH, but wait, LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to give the primary alcohol? Wait no, wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is attached to two carbons. LAH reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reducing the ketone, the structure becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So that's a secondary alcohol at position 3, with a methoxy group at position 5. Wait, but wait, when the ketone is reduced, the carbonyl (C=
