Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, let's visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro (NO2). The numbering probably goes such that the substituents are at the 1, 2, 3 positions around the ring. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so the numbering could vary depending on the substituents' priorities.

Wait, the substituents' priority for numbering is determined by their functional groups. The highest priority is the strongest group. The order of functional groups' priority is usually: nitro (NO2) is higher than ethoxy (OEt), which is higher than tert-butyl. So the nitro group would get the lowest possible number. Let me think: if nitro is at position 1, then ethoxy at 2, tert-butyl at 3? Or wait, I might have to draw this out.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this step by step. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents: tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, that's confusing. Or maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3? Because in the name, the substituents are listed in a certain order: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So the numbering starts at ethoxy as position 1, then moving in a direction where nitro is at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Or is it that the position numbers are assigned based on the substituents' order in the name? Let me think.
