Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is inside the conductor, not touching the outer surface because r < R.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each giving different expressions for E.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges. Like, in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. That's because the charges rearrange themselves to cancel any internal fields.

Wait, but in this case, there's a cavity. So, the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity. How does that affect things?

I think about the concept of shielding. Charges inside a cavity of a conductor do influence the electric fields, but only in certain ways. Oh right, the conductor being neutral, but the cavity's charge induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, more precisely: when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to the cavity's charge. And the outer surface will have no induced charge because the conductor as a whole is neutral. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think.

The conductor is uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. The charge +q in the cavity will cause the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) to have a charge of -q, because it's induced by the +q. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, right? Because the inner is -q, so the outer has +q to make the total zero.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. The cavity has +q, so the inner surface must have -q to balance it. So the outer surface would have +q because the conductor's total is zero, but wait:

Wait, conductor's total charge is zero. So the sum of inner and outer surface charges is zero. The inner surface has -q because of the +q in the cavity. So the outer surface must have +q to make the total conductor's charge zero. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0. Oh wait no, wait: the conductor itself is neutral. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total is zero. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

But wait, the problem states the conductor is uncharged. So yes, the total charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has -q
