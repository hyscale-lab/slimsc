Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's read it carefully. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a base. When you add a strong acid to it, they should react. The goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, I also need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 there is in moles. So, let's find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85. Let me compute that: 106.85 is roughly 100, so 0.1/100 is 0.001. But wait, 106.85 is a bit more than 100, so the moles would be slightly less than 0.001. Let me compute it more accurately:

0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.000936 mol.

So about 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3.

Next, the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Since it's a monobasic strong acid, like HCl or HNO3, the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it might not dissolve easily. Oh wait, but the acid is strong, so it will definitely react. The reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so it would need three H+ ions to neutralize each OH-.

So the balanced equation is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So per mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+.

We have 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3, so the
