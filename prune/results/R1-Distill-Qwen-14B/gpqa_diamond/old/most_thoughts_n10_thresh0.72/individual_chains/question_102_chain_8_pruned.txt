Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each part carefully.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The experiment involves a bicistronic vector with Cre-lox systems. So, I remember that bicistronic means two genes in one construct. The vector uses loxP and another site, maybe lox2272, which I think is a variant that can be used for different recombination events.

The setup is that the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I believe is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Then between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette with lox2272.

The person made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested them on Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, so the loading is correct. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. After the offspring are born, they looked under a confocal microscope for fluorescence but didn't see green.

So the question is why there's no green signal. The options are A to D.

First, let's think about how Cre-lox works. The Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and deletes the DNA between them. If the construct has a loxP before the ligand ORF and another after mCherry, then when Cre is present, the ligand and the rest of the construct would be excised, leaving the receptor with its stop cassette. Wait, but in the question, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after an IRES element. Oh, wait, let me re-read the setup.

Ah, the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but with a stop in a loxP cassette. Then the receptor is at 3', with eGFP, and another stop in a lox2272 cassette. So the vector is: CBA promoter driving ligand, then stop with loxP, then IRES, then receptor, then stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to imagine the construct. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs. The first ORF is the ligand, under CBA, and after the ligand, there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). Then comes the IRES element, which is a regulatory element that allows for internal ribosome entry, so the next ORF can be expressed without a promoter. The second ORF is the receptor, followed by a stop cassette with lox2272.

So in normal conditions, without Cre, the ligand is expressed because of CBA promoter, and then the stop cassette would block expression of the IRES-receptor. But the IRES could allow some expression of the receptor? Or maybe only when the stop is removed.

Wait, but with the stop cassettes, the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP. But the presence of the stop cassettes would prevent their expression unless the lox sites are recombined.

Ah, right. The idea is that Cre would excise the stop cassettes. So in the presence of Cre, the loxP sites would be recognized. But wait, how is the Cre being used here?

The mice are homozygous for the construct. Then they crossed to SO
