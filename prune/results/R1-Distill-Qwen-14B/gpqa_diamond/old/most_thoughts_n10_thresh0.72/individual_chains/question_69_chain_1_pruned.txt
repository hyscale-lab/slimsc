Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me read it again.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Oh, right, that's from special relativity. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is equal to E/(m c²), I think. Oh right, because for a relativistic particle, E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, in natural units where c=1 and ℏ=1, E and mass are in the same units, so gamma would just be E/m. So in this problem, since E is 27 GeV and the mass is 3.41 GeV, gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28, which is a bit higher than 27. So gamma is approximately 7.91, maybe around 7.9 or 8. Let me compute it more accurately. 3.41 times 7.91 is 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.91 is about 3.41*(0.9)=3.069, plus 3.41*0.01=0.0341, so total 3.1031. So 23.87+3.1031=26.9731, which is almost 27. So gamma is approximately 7.91.

So the observed lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau0. So tau = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28. So tau is 63.28e-16 seconds, or 6.328e-15 seconds.

Now, the bubble chamber's resolution must be good enough to observe at least 30% of the decays. So the fraction observed is 30%, which is 0.3. The probability of a decay being observed is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-t/tau), where t is the time the particle spends in the detector (or maybe the chamber?), and tau is the mean lifetime. Wait, but I think I might have that reversed. Let me think again.

Wait no, the decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that the particle decays within a certain time t is P = 1 - e^{-t/tau}. So if we want at least 30% of the decays, P should be at least 0.3. So 0.3 = 1 - e^{-t/tau}, which implies e^{-t/tau} = 0.7. Taking natural logs on both sides: -t/tau = ln(0.7). So t = -tau * ln(0.7).

What's ln(0.7)? Well, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.7 is close to 1, so ln(0.7) is about -0.35667. So t = tau * 0.35667.

So let's calculate t. Tau is 6.328e-15 seconds. Multiply that by 0.35667.

6.328e-15 * 0.35667 ≈ Let me compute this. 6 * 0.35667 is about 2.14, 0.328 *0.35667 is about 0.117. So approximately 2.257e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait— sorry, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me compute it accurately. 6.328e-15 * 0.35667.

Let me compute 6.328 * 0.35667:

6 * 0.35667 = 2.14002
0.328 * 0.35667 ≈ 0.328 *0.35=0.1148, and 0.328 *0.00667≈0.00219. So total is about 0.11699. So sum is 2.14002 + 0.11699=2.25701. So t ≈ 2.257e-15 seconds.

So t is approximately 2.257e-15 seconds.

But wait, wait, what's t here? I think I might have confused t. Actually, in the problem, the proper lifetime is tau0, and we're calculating the observed lifetime tau. So the time the particle spends in the bubble chamber would be t, but perhaps that's not the same as the lifetime. Oh, no, wait no. The tau is the mean lifetime, which is the time the particle is likely to decay. So the time t is the time between creation and when it's observed. Maybe I have to think about the particle's velocity.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think differently. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is v * tau, where v is the velocity. So L = v * tau.

But to have a 30% chance of observing the decay, we need that the decay length is such that the probability is 0.3. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think I need to compute the minimum distance so that the probability of the decay occurring within that distance is at least 30%. So the decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The probability P is the fraction of decays that happen within that distance.

The decay probability depends on the velocity and the lifetime. So the average lifetime is tau, but the particle could decay earlier or later.

Wait, the formula I need is probably P = 1 - e^{-L/(γβc τ_0)}. Because, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, and the velocity is beta c. So the time t that the particle lives as seen in the lab is t = L / (beta c).

So the decay probability is P = 1 - exp( - t / (gamma tau_0) ), which is the same as P = 1 - exp( - L/(gamma beta c tau_0) ). Alternatively, since gamma tau_0 is the mean lifetime tau in the lab frame, t= L/(beta c), so P=1 - exp(- L/(beta c tau) ). But I think the formula is P = 1 - exp(-L/(gamma beta c tau_0) ), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, another approach: the proper lifetime is tau_0. The observed lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. The velocity of the particle is v = beta c. So the average distance it travels before decaying is L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

But perhaps the minimum resolution required is this L, but for a 30% probability, the actual distance would be less than the average.

Wait, no. Because the average distance is when the decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0. But that's the average, and the probability of decaying before that is about 63.2%, which is 1 - e^{-1}.

In our case, we only need 30% of the decays to be observed. So the required decay length L must be such that the probability P is 0.3, which is achieved when L= beta gamma c tau_0 * f, where f is a factor less than 1.

So using the formula:

P = 1 - exp(-L/(L_avg)) ) = 1 - exp( -L/(beta gamma c tau_0) )

We want P >= 0.3.

So 0.3 = 1 - exp(-L/(beta gamma c tau_0) )

Which simplifies to exp(-x) = 0.7, where x = L/(beta gamma c tau_0)

So x = ln(1/0.7) = ln(10/7) ≈ 0.35667.

So L = x * beta gamma c tau_0.

So L = 0.35667 * beta gamma c tau_0.

But wait, beta is v/c, and beta gamma is just (v/c) * gamma. Let me find beta.

We have gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 7.91 approx.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

So gamma is about 7.91, so 1/gamma^2 is about 1
