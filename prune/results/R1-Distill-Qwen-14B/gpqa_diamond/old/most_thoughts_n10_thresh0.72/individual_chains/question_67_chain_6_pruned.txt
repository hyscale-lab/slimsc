Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I remember that p orbitals have a principal quantum number l equal to 1. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1. The question is about the coupled angular momentum state of two electrons. The state given is |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. 

Wait, so l₁ and l₂ are both 1 because each electron is in a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, which makes sense because when you add two l=1 states, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. Here, it's 2, which is the maximum. And m is -1, which is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is measured as -ħ. I need to find the probability of both measurements being -ħ.

I think I need to expand the coupled state into the product basis states of individual electrons. The coupled state |1,1,2,-1> should be expressed in terms of |l₁ m₁> ⊗ |l₂ m₂>. 

Wait, the coupled angular momentum state is a combination of the individual states. The general formula for coupling two angular momenta is through the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. So the state |l₁ l₂; L M> can be written as a sum of |l₁ m₁> |l₂ m₂> terms where m₁ + m₂ = M. 

In this case, M is -1. So each term in the expansion must have m₁ + m₂ = -1. But each m₁ and m₂ can range from -1 to +1. So the possible pairs (m₁, m₂) that sum to -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (maybe others? Let's see. 1 + (-2) is not possible because m can't be less than -l. So yes, only those two possibilities.)

Wait, wait. Let me list all possible (m₁, m₂) pairs:

m₁ can be -1, 0, 1.
Same for m₂.

Summing to M = -1
