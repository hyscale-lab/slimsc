Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine can act as an electrophile in such reactions, adding to aromatic rings. The question is about the para-isomer yield, and I'm supposed to arrange six substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para product.

Wait, the substances are all benzene derivatives. Each of them has a substituent attached, and the substituent will direct the incoming bromine either ortho, meta, or para. Also, the substituents can activate or deactivate the ring, affecting the reactivity.

First, I need to identify each substituent and their directing effects.

Let me list them:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The substituent is methyl, which is an activating group because it's an alkyl chain, donating electrons through the inductive effect. It's a strong activating group. For directing, methyl is an o/p director. So bromine can add in ortho, para positions.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's benzene with an ethyl ester group, like phenyl acetate. The substituent is COOEt. Wait, the carbonyl group is part of an ester. Esters are deactivating groups because the oxygen in the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. They are meta directors. So bromination would be more likely in the meta position.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a halogen, which is a tricky substituent. I think chlorine is slightly deactivating because of its electronegativity, but ortho and para directing because the lone pairs on Cl can conjugate into the ring. So Cl is a o/p director, but deactivating. Wait, so the ring is less reactive than benzene, but the substitution is ortho and para.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating meta director. So bromine will mainly add in the meta position. But since nitro is a strong deactivating group, the ring is less reactive than benzene. So the reaction might be slower, but the regiochemistry is meta.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The substituent is ethyl, similar to methyl. It's an activating o/p director. So bromine can add in ortho, para positions.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. The substituent is COOH, which is a strong deactivating group, as the carboxylic acid is electron-withdrawing. It's also a meta director. But wait, COOH is a strong deactivating group because of the two electronegative oxygens. So the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs meta.

Wait, but for each of these, when bromine is used in excess, it's an electrophilic substitution. So for each substituent, I need to figure out where the bromine adds. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substance, I need to determine the percentage of para-brom
