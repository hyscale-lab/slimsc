Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a charge is placed near a conductor, there's some induction happening. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so that probably affects how the charges distribute.

Alright, the setup: we have a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. Hmm, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together, or the interaction between charges.

I think the first thing to consider is the method of images. Oh right, when a charge is outside a grounded conducting sphere, we can model it by placing an image charge inside the sphere. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. For a conducting sphere that's grounded, the image charge method still applies, right? Because the conductor will have induced charges, and being grounded allows those charges to adjust.

So the image charge method says that the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere can be modeled by placing an image charge somewhere inside the sphere. The image charge's magnitude and position are determined by the geometry. I remember that the image charge for a point charge outside a sphere is q' = -q * (R/d), where d is the distance from the charge to the center, and R is the sphere's radius.

Wait, no, let me think again. The image charge q' should be such that it's inside the sphere, and its magnitude would be such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is the same as it would be due to the actual charges and the image. I think the image charge is given by q' = - (q R) / d, but I'm not sure. Or is it q' = - q (R²)/(d² - R²)? No, maybe that's not right. Another approach: the image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere is such that the potential at the surface due to both the charge and the image charge equals the potential due to the conductor's induced charges. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the sum of the energy of the charge and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential at the sphere's surface is
