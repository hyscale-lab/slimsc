Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each suggesting a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance d is approximately equal to 1 divided by parallax plx, but wait, I think the exact formula is d = 1 / plx, where plx is in parsecs and d is also in parsecs. But wait, no, actually, wait. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. Right, so if plx increases, the star is closer because the parallax is larger. Conversely, if plx decreases, the star is further away.

So the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Let's write that as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance d, because plx = 1/d, we can substitute that in. So 1/plx is d, so 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So substituting, N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance r. So as d increases, N would increase as the fifth power of d. But wait, the question says 'per unit range of distance, r.' Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Do they mean how does the number of stars change as a function of distance, or the density of stars as a function of distance?

Wait, when they say the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, that probably means that N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to d, that's the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about
