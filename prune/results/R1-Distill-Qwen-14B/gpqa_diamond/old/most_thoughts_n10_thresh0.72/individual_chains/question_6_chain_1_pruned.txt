Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a given potential in two dimensions. Hmm, let me break it down.

Alright, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, two-dimensional so polar coordinates maybe? I remember that in such cases, the Schrödinger equation can sometimes be solved by separating variables.

So I think the potential can be rewritten to separate the angular and radial parts. Let me see. The first term is (1/2)kr², that's simple enough. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh wait, I can express cos²θ using a trigonometric identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2, right? So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ).

So putting it together, the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. Wait, let me calculate that: 1/2 plus 3/4 is (2/4 +3/4) =5/4, so the potential becomes (5/4)kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, but wait, I can factor out kr². So V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ]. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think of it as V(r) plus another term that depends on θ.

Wait, maybe I should think about the potential in polar coordinates and see if it's separable. The form looks a bit like a combination of a radial part and an angular part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a harmonic oscillator in radial direction and angular part with some coefficients. But I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe I can write the potential as V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, that's the original form, and perhaps I can factor this into a sum of terms in r² and cos²θ.

Alternatively, perhaps it
