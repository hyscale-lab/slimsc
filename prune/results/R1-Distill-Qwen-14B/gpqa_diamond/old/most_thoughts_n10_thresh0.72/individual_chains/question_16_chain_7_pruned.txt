Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity in various compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through each compound one by one.

Alright, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light. For a compound to be optically active, it must have chirality, which comes from having a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Let me go through each compound listed:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm, so the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Or is it CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Or is it 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2? Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)), and then C3 and C4. Wait, but in any case, the molecule might have a double bond. Now
