Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh right, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization factor. N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). So first, I need to compute N for the given values of phi and alpha.

Wait, phi is given as -pi/4. Let me compute sin(2phi) first. 2phi would be 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. Then, exp(-2 alpha²): alpha is 0.5, so 2*0.5² is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt(e) ≈ 0.6065. So sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-0.6065)) = sqrt(0.3935). Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.3935 is roughly 0.6275. Wait, or maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me see: 0.6275 squared is about 0.6275 * 0.6275. 0.6 *0.6 is 0.36, 0.0275^2 is negligible, but cross terms: 2*0.6*0.0275=0.033. So 0.36 + 0.033=0.393. Oh wait, so 0.6275^2 is approximately 0.393, which matches. So N is approximately 0.6275.

But wait, maybe I should keep more precise numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value isn't necessary if it's a multiple-choice question. Hmm.

Now, the next part is about the relative entropy measure. The formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the density matrix of the given non-Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussianity is often measured by how non-Gaussian a state is compared to a Gaussian state. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (REG) is a measure where you compare the given state (rho) to the closest Gaussian state (tau). The REG is given by S(rho||tau), which is the relative entropy between rho and tau.

In this problem, the formula is given as del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S(rho) is the von Neumann entropy of rho. Because von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho). So del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]? Wait, no, wait. Wait, S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho), so the formula given must be del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)] = [ -S(rho) + S(tau) ]? Hmm, perhaps I should be careful with the signs.

Wait, the formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). But von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = - Tr(rho ln rho). So this would be [ - S(rho) ] - [ -S(tau) ] = S(tau) - S(rho). But wait, no, because the formula is written as Tr(rho ln rho) minus Tr(tau ln tau), which would be [ -
