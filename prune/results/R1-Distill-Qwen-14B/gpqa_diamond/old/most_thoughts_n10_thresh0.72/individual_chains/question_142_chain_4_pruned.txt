Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think through this.

The question gives a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

And asks where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. The options are A to D with various (x,y,z) coordinates. Oh right, qubits are two-level systems, so their space can be represented in Bloch sphere terms.

I think the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize a single qubit state. For a pure state, it's a vector on the sphere's surface. But for mixed states, like the one given here, the density matrix is a statistical mixture, so it's inside the Bloch sphere.

Wait, how do I find the position on the Bloch sphere for a density matrix? I remember that any single-qubit state can be written as a density matrix, and each element corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere. The general form is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2

Where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (x, y, z). So, solving for r would give me the coordinates.

Let me write out the given ρ. It's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute this matrix. 

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so ρ is (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] = (1/2)I.

Wait a second, because I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So ρ = I/2.

Now, let's compare this to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2.

So, I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ.

Which means that r·σ = 0. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σ = σx, σy, σz.

So r·σ is r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. And that equals zero matrix.

Wait, but the only way that this can be true is if r_x, r_y, and r_z are all zero. Because each Pauli matrix is non-zero, and any non-zero combination of them wouldn't sum to zero unless each coefficient is zero.

So r must be (0,0,0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere representation.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0
