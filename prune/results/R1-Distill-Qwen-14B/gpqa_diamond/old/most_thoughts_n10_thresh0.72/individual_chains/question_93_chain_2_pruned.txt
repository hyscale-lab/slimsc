Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through.

The question says the scientist is making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The efficiency is 100%, R squared is 1, and the slope is -3.3. His Ct values are given for different concentrations.

Wait, what's a calibration curve in qPCR? Oh right, it's a standard curve made by running known concentrations of a nucleic acid to determine the relationship between Ct values and the amount of target. The idea is that each dilution step reduces the target by a known factor, and the Ct should increase by a predictable amount based on the efficiency.

So in this case, the efficiency is 100%, which means each cycle halves the target. Wait, but wait, efficiency is usually expressed as a percentage. A 100% efficient PCR would mean that each cycle perfectly doubles the target, right? So the formula for the standard curve is something like Ct = log(target) / log(2) * efficiency factor, but wait, actually, the standard curve equation is usually Ct = (log10(concentration) + intercept) / slope. But when the efficiency is 100%, I think each ten-fold dilution would increase the Ct by a certain number of cycles.

Wait, the slope is -3.3. Hmm, in standard qPCR, a 100% efficient PCR should have a slope of -3.322 when using log10(concentration) vs Ct. Because each ten-fold dilution (which is a log10 change of 1) should result in an increase of 3.322 Ct values. So that's roughly matching what's given here.

Looking at the data:

At 100,000 copies, Ct is around 34. For 10,000, it's 30.6, 1000 is 27.3, 100 is 24, and 10 is 20.7.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate the differences between each ten-fold dilution. From 100,000 (1e5) to
