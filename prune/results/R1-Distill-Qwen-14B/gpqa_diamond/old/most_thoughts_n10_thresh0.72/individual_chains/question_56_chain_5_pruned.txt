Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state into |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules for electron transitions in hydrogen? Oh right, for a dipole transition, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l is Δl = ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m doesn't change (Δm = 0), or changes by ±1. But wait, wait, another thing: the principal quantum number n can change by any number as long as the other conditions are met.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So n changes from 3 to 1, which is a decrease by 2. But since it's a two-step process, each step can only change n by 1, right? Because in each dipole transition, Δn must be ±1. So from 3 to 2 in the first step, then 2 to 1 in the second.

Now, each transition must follow the l and m selection rules. The initial l is 0 (s orbital). So the first transition must change l by ±1. So from l=0, the next l can be 1.

So the first transition would go from |3,0,0⟩ to either |2,1, m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩. But wait, what about the second transition? It has to go from n=2 to n=1, so again, l must change by ±1. The l for the intermediate state is 1, so the next l must be 0 or 2. But the final state is l=0, so from l=1, the second transition must go to l=0.

So the possible m values for each step: Let's think about the first step. The initial m is 0. So in the first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. Wait, no, the selection rule for m is Δm = 0,

Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm. Let's try to break this down.

The question says that the state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen atoms, transitions are governed by the selection rules. Oh right, the dipole selection rules. For electrons transitioning between energy levels, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, unless it's a quadrupole transition or something else, but the question specifies dipole, so those rules apply.

So, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So we're going from a state with l=0 to another l=0 state. Wait, but according to the selection rules, for a dipole transition, Δl must be ±1. So the initial l is 0, so the next state must have l=1 or l=-1, but since l can't be negative, just l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So, the transition must go from |3,0,0⟩ to some |n',1,m'⟩, then from there to |1,0,0⟩. Let's think about possible n's for the first transition.

The first transition is from n=3 to some n', but for a dipole transition, Δn can be any as long as Δl is ±1. Wait, no, the selection rules for hydrogen are usually Δn = any, as long as l changes by ±1. Or wait, no, I think the main thing is that l changes by ±1. So for the first transition, from l=0 → l=1. So possible states are l=1, m can change by 0, ±1.

So the first transition is 3,0,0 → n',1,m'. The possible m values for the intermediate state are m = 0, ±1. But wait, the initial m is 0, so m can go to m' = 0 ±1, so 0, 1, or -1. But wait, the initial state is m=0, so in the first transition, m must change by 0, ±1. So
