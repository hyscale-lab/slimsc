Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN using reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different A and B reagents.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by looking at the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. The reaction of ketones with cyanide is typically the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group, leading to a cyanohydrin formation. So the product should be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be NC-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, but wait, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Let me think: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So adding NaCN in the presence of acid would give a cyanohydrin. The acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack, forming a new bond. The mechanism would be the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate, then losing water, but wait, no, because in the presence of acid, the CN- would act as a nucleophile. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: that's NC-CH2
