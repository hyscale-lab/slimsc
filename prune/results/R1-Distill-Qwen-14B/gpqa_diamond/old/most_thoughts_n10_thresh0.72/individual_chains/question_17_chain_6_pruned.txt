Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions. The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that the formation constant K is related to the concentration of the complex and the ions it's made from. The formula is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Oh, right, because the complex is formed from Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the solution is stoichiometric. So that means the amount of EDTA is just right to form the complex with all the calcium, right? So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, which is the same as the initial concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA before they form the complex.

Wait, no. Actually, in a stoichiometric solution, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio because each Ca^2+ binds with one EDTA molecule. So when they form the complex, each mole of Ca^2+ uses one mole of EDTA. So if the solution is 0.02 M Ca
