Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not entirely sure how that method affects the orbital periods. Anyway, the problem gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and mass ratios, and I need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. All have the same albedo of 0.3, like Earth.

First, let's note down the given data:

- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 (T1/T2) ≈ 1.4
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 (T2/T3) ≈ 2.3
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 (M1/M2) ≈ 1.15
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 (M2/M3) ≈ 1.35
- Albedo for all is 0.3.

We need to find the ratio P3/P1, where P is the orbital period.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to the star's luminosity, the planet's orbital distance, and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4)

But wait, wait. Let me recall the formula correctly. The equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet is given by:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Here, T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, D is the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis), and a is the albedo.

Wait, but maybe I can use the ratio of temperatures between the planets. Since all are orbiting the same star (I assume), T_star and R_star would be the same for all. So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets would depend only on their orbital distances and albedos.

But in this problem, the albedos are equal, so the albedo term (1 - a)^(1/4) is the same for all. Therefore, the temperature ratio would only depend on the square root of (1/(D)).

So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.

Wait, let's think: Te is proportional to sqrt(1/D). So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, let's recheck that. If Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), then Te1/Te2 = (1/sqrt(D1)) / (1/sqrt(D2)) ) = sqrt(D2/D1).

Yes, that's right. So, T1/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 ), because T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(D1), T2 proportional to 1/sqrt
