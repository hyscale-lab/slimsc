Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids through a disproportionation reaction. After that, when X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they both give the same substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably a saturated compound. Additionally, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

Hmm. Let's figure out what's going on step by step.

First, the initial mixture X has two liquids. These liquids decolorize bromine water, so they must have unsaturationâ€”like double bonds or triple bonds. Because when you have a double bond, bromine adds across it, causing the solution to decolorize. So X's components are unsaturated.

When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, the question says it's a mixture, so perhaps each of the two components in X undergoes a disproportionation reaction into two different substances in Y. Or maybe one component is split into two, but considering it's equimolar, perhaps each component is split equally.

The result is that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So the products are saturated, meaning all double or triple bonds have been hydrogenated. Wait, but wait! No, because when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So maybe X is something that can be hydrogenated further, but Y's products are already hydrogenated. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about the hydrogenation of X and Y. Both give the same Z. So X, when hydrogenated, gives Z, and Y, when hydrogenated, also gives Z. So Z must be a more saturated compound than both X and Y. But wait, Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y must already be fully saturated. Therefore, when Y is hydrogenated, it doesn't change any more because it's already saturated. So Z must come from hydrogenating Y, but since Y doesn't react, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but the problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. Hmm, perhaps Y is already a saturated compound, so hydrogenating it doesn't change anything. But X isn't, so hydrogenating X gives Z. Wait, but the problem says both X and Y hydrogenate to Z. That's confusing.

Wait, the question says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it becomes Y. Then, when X and Y are hydrogenated, both give Z. So X, upon hydrogenation, becomes Z, and Y, upon hydrogenation, also becomes Z. So Y must be a compound that doesn't change upon hydrogenation, meaning it's already fully hydrogenated, i.e., no double bonds. Wait, but Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. And X's components can't have conjugated multiple bonds
