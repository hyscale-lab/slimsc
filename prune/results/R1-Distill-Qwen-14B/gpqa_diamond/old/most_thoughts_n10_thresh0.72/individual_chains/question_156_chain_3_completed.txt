Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. So, the setup is:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.

Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. What's observed in each?

The options are A to D, each suggesting a different number of peaks in each type of HPLC.

Hmm, okay. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is an electrocyclic opening, right? Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via a cyclic transition state, which is an electrocyclic process. But the specifics of that... I think the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, actually, mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. The addition is syn or anti? Let me think. For mCPBA, the reaction is a peracid reacting with an alkene in a process called epoxidation. The mechanism is that the peracid attacks the double bond in a way that forms the epoxide. Since the peracid is a good electrophile, the alkene attacks it, leading to the formation of an intermediate that then closes to form the epoxide.

The key here is that the epoxidation leads to the formation of an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry based on the starting alkene's geometry. So for (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, the reaction with mCPBA will form different epoxides, right?

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents on the 4th and 5th carbons. For (E) isomer, the higher priority groups on each carbon are opposite each other, and for (Z), they're on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the alkene? Or does it invert? Hmm. Actually, the epoxidation by mCPBA proceeds through a concerted mechanism where the peracid adds across the double bond, creating an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the double bond is retained in the epoxide because the addition is a suprafacial process. So if the starting alkene is trans (E), the epoxide will have the two substituents on the same side, making it a cis epoxide. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, the alkene geometry is E or Z, and the epoxidation's stereochemistry depends on that. For example, when a trans (E) double bond is epoxidized, the resulting epoxide will have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides of the original plane. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Let me visualize (E)-oct-4-ene. The two substituents (CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3) on each end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms from the peracid add across the double bond. Because the alkene is trans, the two new oxygen groups will end up on opposite sides, making the epoxide trans as well. So the epoxide will be trans.

Similarly, for the (Z) isomer, the substituents on each end are on the same side. So when the epoxide forms, the oxygen atoms will end up on the same side, leading to a cis epoxide.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, not necessarily. Because the epoxidation is a peracid adding in a way that forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific. So the starting E geometry will lead to a trans epoxide? Or does it become a cis epoxide?

Wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think again. The double bond is E, so the groups on each carbon are opposite. When the peracid attacks, the oxygens add to each of the carbons. Since the two oxygens come from the same peracid molecule, perhaps the addition is such that the oxygens are on the same face. So for an E double bond, which has groups opposite, the addition of the two oxygens from the same face would result in the epoxide having the two oxygens on adjacent faces.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of a specific example. Take (E)-2-butene. The structure is CH2CHCH2CH3 with the double bond between C2 and C3. The groups on each end (CH3 and CH2CH3) are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it would form an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are added to the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. Because the starting alkene was trans, the addition of the same face oxygens would lead to the two oxygens being on the same face in the epoxide.

Wait, that would make the epoxide a trans structure. Or wait, no. Wait, when the two oxygens are added to the same face of the double bond, the resulting epoxide has the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide in the ring. Or perhaps I should draw it.

Imagine the E double bond as:

CH2- C(=O) – C(=O)- CH2CH3
    \   /
     O

Wait, no. Let me think of it as:

For (E)-2-butene: CH2CH2 structure where the substituents (CH3 and CH2CH3) are opposite each other.

When mCPBA adds, the peracid's O-O group adds across the double bond. The peracid's oxygen adds to one carbon, and the adjacent oxygen is added to the other, but since they are from the same peracid, they add from the same face.

So, the two carbons each get an oxygen, and the two new oxygen atoms are on the same face, leading to the epoxide being cis in that the two oxygens are adjacent in the same face.

Wait, but in terms of the ring, the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the oxygen atoms are on adjacent carbons. So, in the case of (E)-double bond, the substituents are on opposite sides, but the epoxide oxygens are added on the same face, so the epoxide ring would have the two substituents (the two R groups) on the same face. No, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the epoxidation using mCPBA is stereospecific and leads to the formation of a cis epoxide when the starting alkene is cis (Z), and trans when the starting alkene is trans (E). Or the opposite.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me look up a quick note in my memory. Oh right, mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via a concerted mechanism. The addition is stereospecific, meaning the configuration of the starting alkene is retained in the epoxide. So, a trans (E) alkene will form a trans epoxide, and a cis (Z) alkene will form a cis epoxide.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the addition of the two oxygen atoms is from the same face. So, if the starting alkene is trans, the substituents on each carbon are on opposite sides. When the two oxygens are added on the same face, the substituents on each carbon (like a methyl and another substituent) will end up on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For an E alkene, the groups were opposite, so in the epoxide, the oxygens are on the same face, leading to the substituents on the same side in the epoxide. Or the other way around.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the products of each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide. Let's call this Epoxide A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide. Let's call this Epoxide B.

Then, both epoxides are treated with aqueous acid. What happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid?

Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening. The acid protonates the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the less substituted carbon because the more substituted carbon is more stabilized when it bears a positive charge.

Wait, no, actually, it depends. The ring-opening of epoxides in acid can lead to different products based on the structure. In epoxide ring-opening, the nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (if the carbocation is formed). Alternatively, in some cases, the less substituted is attacked because of the less steric hindrance.

Wait, but considering that the starting epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the position of attack is the same.

Wait, the epoxide from each reaction would be different. Let me think.

Wait, the starting alkenes are oct-4-ene, which is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3. So, in the case of (E) and (Z), the substituents on each end are either opposite or same.

Epoxidation with mCPBA would create an epoxide where the two oxygen atoms are added on the same face of the double bond.

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end are opposite. When the epoxide forms, the two oxygen atoms are added on the same face. So, for (E), the substituents (CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3) are opposite, but the oxygens are added on the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide from (E) is a trans epoxide and from (Z) is a cis epoxide.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think about the ring-opening of each epoxide.

So, after mCPBA treatment, each epoxide is formed. Then, when aqueous acid is added, each epoxide ring opens.

In the case of an epoxide, acid-catalyzed ring-opening leads to the formation of a diol. The diol's stereochemistry depends on the starting epoxide's structure.

If the epoxide is trans, the diol would be trans as well. If the epoxide is cis, the diol would be cis.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The ring-opening of an epoxide in acidic conditions proceeds via a carbocation intermediate. For a trans epoxide, when the ring opens, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon. The attack occurs from the opposite side due to the planar carbocation, leading to the formation of a trans diol.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the mechanism. When an epoxide is treated with acid, the oxygen becomes protonated, making the adjacent carbons positively polarized. The nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon (but in symmetric epoxides, it's the same on both sides). The attack occurs from the opposite side because the transition state has some partial positive charge, and the nucleophile attacks from the less hindered side.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, in an asymmetric epoxide, the nucleophile will attack the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized. But for a symmetric epoxide, like in our case (oct-4-ene epoxide), the two carbons are equivalent, so attack occurs equally on either side, leading to a mixture.

Wait, but in our case, the epoxide is from oct-4-ene. So the structure is:

CH2CH2CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2CH3

Wait, no, the epoxide would be on C4 and C5. So for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, wait, maybe I should write it correctly. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5, so it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5, making it CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on that.

Wait, let's think of oct-4-ene as CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond: CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that's not correct. Wait, no, octene is C8H16. So for oct-4-ene, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5.

When mCPBA epoxidizes (E)-oct-4-ene, the resulting epoxide would have the oxygens on opposite sides if the starting alkene was E. Wait, no. Wait, when the alkene is E (trans), the two substituents on each end are opposite. When mCPBA adds, the two oxygens are added on the same face, leading to the epoxide being cis. So the substituents on each end of the epoxide are cis.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think that the peracid adds in a way that the same face of each carbon is attacked. So for a trans (E) double bond, adding oxygens to the same face would result in the epoxide having the two substituents on the same side. Let me try to imagine that.

E.g., (E)-stilbene (trans double bond) when epoxidized would give a trans epoxide? Or a cis one? No, I think it gives a cis epoxide because the oxygens add on the same face.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of a simple example: (E)-2-butene. Structure is CH2CHCH2CH3 with the double bond between C2 and C3. The groups on each end are opposite (CH3 and CH2CH3 on opposite sides). When mCPBA epoxidizes it, the oxygens add on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. So the substituents (CH3 and CH2CH3) are on the same side in the epoxide.

Wait, then when the epoxide ring opens under acidic conditions, what happens? The ring-opening would lead to a diol. For a cis epoxide, the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side, leading to a trans diol. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, when a cis epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the nucleophile attacks from the opposite side of the more substituted carbon. So in the case of the cis epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene, the attack would occur on each carbon, leading to the formation of a trans diol.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me approach this more methodically.

1. Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → reacts with mCPBA → forms an epoxide, let's call it EpoA.

2. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → reacts with mCPBA → forms another epoxide, EpoB.

3. Each epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid, leading to diols.

So I need to figure out the diastereomers (if any) formed from each epoxide.

First, let's determine the structure of EpoA and EpoB.

EpoA comes from (E)-oct-4-ene. Since the starting alkene is E, the substituents on each end (CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3) are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds to this, the oxygens add to the same face, making the epoxide a cis configuration. Wait, so EpoA would be a cis epoxide.

Similarly, EpoB comes from (Z)-oct-4-ene, where the substituents are on the same side. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygens are added to the same face, leading to a trans epoxide? Or wait, no. Wait, the starting alkene is Z (same substituents on same sides). Adding oxygens to the same face would make the substituents on each end of the epoxide on the same side, leading to a cis epoxide? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the E stereochemistry leads to a trans epoxide. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because when the starting alkene is E, the epoxide has the substituents on opposite sides, making it a trans epoxide. No, that doesn't make sense because the addition is from the same face. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look at the product diols.

Each epoxide, when treated with acid, will form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the epoxide's configuration.

If EpoA is a cis epoxide, then upon acid treatment, the nucleophilic attack would occur from opposite sides, leading to a trans diol. Alternatively, if the epoxide is trans, the attack leads to a cis diol.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think of the ring-opening mechanism.

In acid, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. The ring then opens when the nucleophile (water) attacks one of the carbons. The attack occurs at the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (less substituted in some cases, but perhaps in this case, both are equally substituted). Since the epoxide is symmetric (oct-4-ene epoxide), both carbons are equally substituted, so the attack can occur equally on either carbon.

But the key is the stereochemistry of the diol. For a cis epoxide, when the ring opens, the attack occurs on opposite faces, leading to a trans diol. For a trans epoxide, the attack occurs on the same face, leading to a cis diol.

Wait, no. Let me think about this in terms of chair-like transition states. For a cis epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on the same face. When the ring opens, the water molecules attack the two carbons from opposite faces, leading to the hydroxyl groups being on opposite sides. So the diol would be trans.

Wait, but that's only if the epoxide is symmetric. If the epoxide is symmetric, like in our case, the diol will have two possible configurations: both hydroxyls on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans). But in reality, for a symmetric epoxide, the attack can occur from either face, leading to a racemic mixture if the epoxide is chiral. Hmm, but wait, in our case, if the epoxide is symmetric, it might not be chiral.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try an example.

Take (R,R) and (S,S) epoxides. If the epoxide is not symmetric, it would be chiral. But in our case, for oct-4-ene, the epoxide is symmetric because the two substituents on each side are the same. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH2CH3, which are actually the same groups, making the epoxide symmetric.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond is connected to CH2CH2CH2- (from the left) and CH2CH3 (from the right). Wait, no, that's not symmetric. So each end of the epoxide would have different substituents.

Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. That's not correct because that would make it CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let's simplify. Let's say the molecule is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with double bond between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond is CH2CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3. So the substituents are CH2CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3 on each end.

So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms are added to the same face, leading to the epoxide configuration. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are opposite. So, in the epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on the same face. Thus, the substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH3) are on the same side of the epoxide ring. So the epoxide would be a cis epoxide, because the substituents are on the same side.

Wait, but wait, for the (E) isomer, the substituents are opposite. Adding the oxygens on the same face would cause the substituents to be on the same side in the epoxide. So, EpoA is a cis epoxide.

Similarly, for the (Z) isomer, the substituents are on the same side of the double bond. Adding the oxygens on the same face would lead to the substituents being on opposite sides in the epoxide, making it trans.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For (Z) oct-4-ene, the substituents are on the same side. When mCPBA adds oxygens to the same face, the substituents would end up on opposite sides in the epoxide, making it trans.

So EpoA is a cis epoxide (from E starting material), and EpoB is a trans epoxide (from Z starting material).

Now, when each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring opens to form diols.

For EpoA (cis epoxide), the ring-opening in acid leads to a trans diol. Because in the cis epoxide, the two substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH3) are on the same side. When the epoxide opens, the nucleophile (water) attacks each carbon from opposite sides, leading to the hydroxyl groups being on opposite sides, forming a trans diol.

For EpoB (trans epoxide), the substituents are on opposite sides. When the ring opens, the nucleophiles attack from the same side, leading to the hydroxyl groups being on the same side, forming a cis diol.

But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, like in our case, because the substituents on each end of the epoxide are the same (because it's oct-4-ene, each end is CH2CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3?), no, wait. No, in oct-4-ene, the substituents on each side of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH3, which are different. So the epoxide is not symmetric, meaning that each epoxide has two different substituents on each carbon.

So for EpoA, which is a cis epoxide, the substituents are on the same side. When the epoxide opens, the two attacks happen from opposite faces, leading to the diol with hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans diol).

For EpoB, which is a trans epoxide, the substituents are on opposite sides. When the epoxide opens, the attacks occur from the same face, leading to the diol with hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis diol).

Wait, but wait. The diol's configuration would depend on the attack direction. Let me think of the epoxide as carbons A and B. For EpoA (cis), the substituents on A and B are on the same face. When acid is added, the protonated epoxide becomes more electrophilic. Attack occurs at A and B. The attack at A comes from the opposite face (since the leaving group is on the same face), and same for B. So the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, making it trans.

Similarly, for EpoB (trans), the substituents are on opposite faces. The attack happens from the same face for both A and B, leading to the hydroxyl groups on the same side, making it cis.

Wait, but in reality, when the epoxide is asymmetric, the ring-opening under acidic conditions leads to the formation of a diol where each hydroxyl group is on the opposite face of the neighboring carbon. So for a cis epoxide (EpoA), the diol would be trans. For a trans epoxide (EpoB), the diol would be cis.

Wait, maybe I should think about the outcome. So, EpoA (from E-alkene) → trans diol. EpoB (from Z-alkene) → cis diol.

Wait, but no. Let me think again. Upon ring-opening of a cis epoxide, the attack occurs on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol. Upon ring-opening of a trans epoxide, the attack occurs on the same side, leading to a cis diol.

So, for Reaction 1:

(E)-oct-4-ene → EpoA (cis) → trans diol.

Reaction 2:

(Z)-oct-4-ene → EpoB (trans) → cis diol.

Therefore, the products are a trans diol and a cis diol.

But then, when these diols are combined, what happens?

Wait, each diol is a diastereomer of the other. The trans diol and the cis diol are diastereomers. Additionally, each diol could potentially have enantiomers if the molecule is chiral.

So the diol from Reaction 1 (trans) has two stereogenic centers (C4 and C5), making it a diastereomer of the diol from Reaction 2 (cis). But are they enantiomers? Let me check.

The structure of each diol would be:

For trans diol: HO-C4 and HO-C5 are on opposite sides.

For cis diol: HO-C4 and HO-C5 are on the same side.

Are these diols chiral?

Each diol has two stereogenic centers (C4 and C5). Let's see:

In the trans diol, the configuration would be (R) and (S) at C4 and C5, respectively. Wait, no, if they are trans, maybe they are both R and S or both S and R.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. For the trans diol, let's say the hydroxyl groups are on opposite faces.

So, from C4 to C5, the groups are arranged as:

C4: CH2CH2CH2CH2-, HO-, and two other groups (probably CH2 groups).

C5: CH2CH3, HO-, and two other groups.

Wait, perhaps if the two stereocenters are adjacent and have opposite configurations, the molecule might not be chiral. Wait, no, wait. If the two stereocenters are adjacent and have opposite configurations, the molecule could still be chiral. For example, 2,3-dihydroxybutane is a meso compound because the two stereocenters are opposite, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, no, 2,3-dihydroxybutane is actually a meso compound. Let me think: if the diol is HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH3, then if the hydroxyls are on opposite sides (trans), the structure would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 with trans configuration. Wait, no, if it's meso, the molecule is achiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the diols formed.

If the starting epoxide is symmetric (which in our case, it's not, because the substituents are different on each end), then the diol might be a meso compound.

But in our case, the substituents on each end are different, so the epoxide isn't symmetric, leading to the diol being chiral.

Wait, no, in this case, the diol would have two stereocenters. For Reaction 1: trans diol, which might be a pair of enantiomers. For Reaction 2: cis diol, which might also be a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but perhaps each diol is a single enantiomer, but that's not possible because the reaction goes to 100% completion. Wait, no. Wait, when the epoxide is treated with acid, it opens to form a diol. The ring-opening in acid could lead to a racemic mixture if the epoxide is chiral, but in our case, the epoxide is from an achiral starting material? No, wait.

Wait, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), which are chiral themselves. So the epoxides would also be chiral, and their ring-opening under acid would lead to diols that are also chiral.

Wait, for example, let's say Reaction 1 produces a single enantiomer of the trans diol, and Reaction 2 produces a single enantiomer of the cis diol. Or perhaps each reaction produces a racemic mixture.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is not a chiral molecule. Because for oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the substituents on each end are CH2CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3. Are these groups identical? No, because CH2CH2CH2CH2 is a longer chain than CH2CH3. So (E)-oct-4-ene is a chiral molecule because the substituents on each end are different.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must have no plane of symmetry. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, with the double bond between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond has different substituents: on the left, CH2CH2CH2CH2- and on the right, CH2CH3. So yes, (E)-oct-4-ene is a chiral molecule because the substituents on each end are different. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene is also chiral.

So when each reacts with mCPBA, they form epoxides that are also chiral. Then, when the epoxides are treated with acid, each ring-opening leads to diols that are chiral.

Wait, but in the case of the epoxide being chiral, the ring-opening in acid would lead to a racemic mixture of diol enantiomers. Because the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide typically leads to a racemic mixture if the epoxide is chiral, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but in the problem statement, both reactions go to 100% completion. So perhaps each reaction forms a single product, but considering the possibility of diastereomers.

Wait, no, the problem says that each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each reaction gives a single product. So each diol is a single diastereomer.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's take Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → EpoA (cis epoxide) → trans diol.

But wait, the trans diol would have two stereocenters, but perhaps it's a meso compound, making it achiral. Because if the two stereocenters are opposite, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not a meso compound because the substituents are different on each end.

Wait, let me consider the structure of the diol. For Reaction 1, the diol would be HOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3 with the hydroxyls on opposite sides (trans configuration).

But since the substituents on each stereocenter are different (CH2CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH3), the molecule would be chiral, and the diol would be a pair of enantiomers. But since the reaction goes to 100% of a single enantiomer, perhaps the diol is a single enantiomer.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, when the epoxide is chiral, the ring-opening would proceed to form both enantiomers, leading to a racemic mixture. But the problem states that both reactions go to 100% completion, implying that each reaction gives a single product. So perhaps each diol is a single enantiomer, but that's unlikely unless the reaction has some selectivity.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is a meso compound, making it achiral. Let me see.

If the diol is HO-(C4)-(CH2CH2CH2CH2- and two CH2 groups) and HO-(C5)-(CH2CH3 and two CH2 groups), and the configurations are trans, then perhaps there's no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the products.

Reaction 1: mCPBA adds to (E)-oct-4-ene to form a cis epoxide. Then, acid treatment leads to a trans diol, which is a vicinal diol with trans configuration.

Reaction 2: mCPBA adds to (Z)-oct-4-ene to form a trans epoxide. Acid treatment leads to a cis diol.

Now, the diols from each reaction are diastereomers. So when combined, they form two diastereomers.

But wait, each diol could potentially have enantiomers if they're chiral.

So, the diol from Reaction 1 (trans diol) is chiral, so it exists as two enantiomers. Similarly, the diol from Reaction 2 (cis diol) is also chiral, existing as two enantiomers.

But in each reaction, the product is 100% of a single enantiomer, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific.

Wait, no. The starting materials are (E) and (Z), which are themselves chiral. So when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts, the epoxide is a single enantiomer, leading to a diol that's a single enantiomer. Similarly for (Z).

Wait, but actually, are the diols from each reaction chiral? Let me think about their structures.

The diol from Reaction 1 has two stereogenic centers (C4 and C5), each with different substituents. So it would be chiral. Similarly, the diol from Reaction 2 is also chiral.

But when each diol is formed, the reaction goes to 100% of a single enantiomer. So the products are two different enantiomeric diols.

Wait, but that can't be right because the diols are from different starting materials. Let me clarify.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → EpoA (cis epoxide) → trans diol. Let's assume this trans diol is a single enantiomer, say (R,R) or (S,S).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → EpoB (trans epoxide) → cis diol. This cis diol would be a single enantiomer as well, say (R,S) or (S,R), but since it's a cis diol, perhaps it's (R,R) or (S,S) configuration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual configurations.

Let me imagine the structure of the diols.

For the trans diol (from Reaction 1):

- C4 has substituents: CH2CH2CH2CH2-, two CH2 groups, and the hydroxyl group.

- C5 has substituents: CH2CH3, two CH2 groups, and the hydroxyl group.

In the trans diol, the hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides. So, C4 has the hydroxyl on the right, and C5 has it on the left, or vice versa.

Similarly, for the cis diol (from Reaction 2), the hydroxyls are on the same side.

Now, each diol would have two stereocenters. Because the substituents are different on each carbon, the diol is chiral, and each diol consists of two enantiomers.

Wait, but in each reaction, the starting material is a single enantiomer (E or Z), so the product diol would also be a single enantiomer. So, for Reaction 1, the product is a single enantiomer of the trans diol, and for Reaction 2, the product is a single enantiomer of the cis diol.

Wait, but the trans diol has two enantiomers, and the cis diol has two enantiomers as well. So when the products are combined, we have two diastereomers (trans and cis) and each of them has their own pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but no. Because the trans diol and the cis diol are diastereomers, and each is a pair of enantiomers. So the total number of stereoisomers would be four: two from the trans diol (enantiomers) and two from the cis diol (enantiomers).

But wait, no. Because each diol is formed as a single enantiomer. So Reaction 1 gives one enantiomer of the trans diol, and Reaction 2 gives one enantiomer of the cis diol. So when combined, the mixture has two diastereomers, each present as a single enantiomer. Therefore, the mixture contains four stereoisomers in total? No, because each diol is formed as a single enantiomer. So, the products are two stereoisomers: the trans diol as one enantiomer, and the cis diol as one enantiomer. So the total is two stereoisomers.

Wait, but that doesn't add up. Let me think again.

Wait, the diols are two diastereomers (trans and cis), but each is a pair of enantiomers. So if each reaction produces a single enantiomer of their respective diol, then the mixture would have two enantiomers from the trans diol and two from the cis diol. But wait, no, because the starting materials are each a single enantiomer, leading to a single enantiomer of diol in each reaction. So the mixture would have two stereoisomers: the trans diol (single enantiomer) and the cis diol (single enantiomer).

So, when combined, the mixture would have two stereoisomers. But wait, no. Let me think in terms of their configurations.

If the trans diol has two enantiomers (A and B), and the cis diol has two enantiomers (C and D), then Reaction 1 produces, say, A, and Reaction 2 produces, say, C. So the mixture has A and C. But wait, no, because the diastereomers are trans and cis, which are distinct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the products are two diastereomers, each of which exists as a pair of enantiomers. So the mixture would have four stereoisomers.

Wait, but in each reaction, the product is a single enantiomer because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific. So Reaction 1 gives a single enantiomer of the trans diol, and Reaction 2 gives a single enantiomer of the cis diol. So the mixture would have two distinct stereoisomers.

Wait, but the diol from Reaction 1 (trans) is a diastereomer of the diol from Reaction 2 (cis). So in the mixture, there are two diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer.

Wait, but that's not possible because each diol is a pair of enantiomers. No, the diol is a pair of enantiomers only if it has a chiral center. So each diol is a pair, but in each reaction, only one enantiomer is formed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but each reaction produces only one of them. So Reaction 1 gives one enantiomer of the trans diol, and Reaction 2 gives one enantiomer of the cis diol.

So when the products are combined, we have two diastereomers, each present as a single enantiomer. So the mixture would have two stereoisomers.

Now, when this mixture is run on an achiral HPLC column, what happens?

On an achiral column, enantiomers would co-elute because the column doesn't distinguish between them. So each diastereomer would appear as a single peak. So the mixture has two diastereomers, leading to two peaks on the achiral column.

On a chiral HPLC column, which can separate enantiomers, each diastereomer would be separated into its two enantiomers. But wait, in our case, each diol is present as a single enantiomer. So for the trans diol (A), if it were to be separated on a chiral column, it would show as one peak. Similarly, the cis diol (C) would show as another peak. So the chiral column would give two peaks as well.

Wait, but if each diol is present as a single enantiomer, then on a chiral column, each would be a single peak. So the chiral HPLC would show two peaks, same as the achiral.

But that can't be right because the options don't have that. The options are:

A) 4 peaks in both
B) 2 peaks in standard and 3 in chiral
C) 2 in both
D) 3 in standard and 4 in chiral

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the diols are each a pair of enantiomers, but each reaction produces only one enantiomer. So Reaction 1 produces one enantiomer of the trans diol, and Reaction 2 produces one enantiomer of the cis diol.

So the mixture has two stereoisomers: enantiomer A of trans, and enantiomer C of cis.

On an achiral column, each diastereomer (trans and cis) is a single peak, regardless of enantiomer. So we'd see two peaks.

On a chiral column, each enantiomer would be separated. But since each diastereomer is present as a single enantiomer, each would elute as a single peak. So the chiral column would also show two peaks.

But that's not matching any of the options. The options don't have C) as the answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the diols being only two. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each diol has two enantiomers, and the mixture contains both enantiomers of each diol. But that would require that each reaction produces a racemic mixture, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that both reactions go to 100% completion. That could mean that each reaction produces a single product, which might be a racemic mixture or a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the diols are chiral. Let me think again.

In the case where the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound, making it achiral. But in our case, the substituents are different on each end, so the epoxide is asymmetric, leading to a chiral diol.

Wait, but in that case, each diol is chiral and would have two enantiomers. So if each reaction produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both enantiomers), then the mixture would have four stereoisomers: two from each diol.

But the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion. So perhaps each reaction produces a single enantiomer of the diol.

In that case, the mixture would have two stereoisomers: one enantiomer of trans diol and one enantiomer of cis diol.

So on the achiral column, each diastereomer is a single peak, leading to two peaks.

On the chiral column, each enantiomer is separated, but since each diol is present as a single enantiomer, each would elute as a single peak. So the chiral column would show two peaks.

But that's not an option in the choices. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a meso compound, making it achiral. Let me consider the structure.

If the diol is HO-C4-O-C5-O-H, and the substituents on C4 and C5 are arranged symmetrically, then the diol would be a meso compound.

But in our case, the substituents are different. So the diol is not a meso compound and is chiral.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible number of peaks.

If the diol from each reaction is a single enantiomer, then the mixture contains two diastereomeric enantiomers.

On an achiral column, each diastereomer is a single peak, so two peaks.

On a chiral column, each diastereomer's enantiomer is separated. But since each diol is a single enantiomer, each would elute as a single peak. So the chiral column would show two peaks.

But that's option C: 2 in both. But looking at the options, option C is '2 peaks in standard and chiral HPLC'. So that would be the case.

But wait, I'm not sure. Another possibility is that each diol is a pair of enantiomers, and the mixture contains both enantiomers of each diol. Then, the total number of stereoisomers would be four: two from each diol.

In that case, the standard HPLC would show two peaks (each diastereomer as a single peak). The chiral column would show four peaks (each enantiomer as a separate peak).

But the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion, implying that each reaction produces a single product. So if the product is a pair of enantiomers (racemic), then each reaction would give a racemic mixture, leading to four stereoisomers in the mixture.

Wait, but that contradicts the 100% completion statement. Because a racemic mixture is 50:50, not 100% of a single product.

So perhaps each reaction produces a single enantiomer of the diol. So the mixture has two stereoisomers.

In that case, the standard HPLC shows two peaks, the chiral shows two peaks as well. So option C.

But looking back at the options, option C is '2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC'.

But wait, let me read the question again. The chemist combines the products of both reactions. So the products are from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2.

If each reaction produces a single enantiomer of their respective diols, then the mixture has two diastereomers, each as a single enantiomer.

On standard HPLC: two peaks (each diastereomer is a single peak).

On chiral HPLC: each diastereomer's single enantiomer would elute as a single peak, so two peaks in total.

So the answer would be option C.

But wait, another possibility: each reaction produces a racemic mixture, but the problem states 100% completion. So each reaction produces 100% of a single product, which could be a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a single enantiomer, leading to two stereoisomers in the mixture.

So on achiral column: two peaks (trans and cis).

On chiral column: each stereoisomer is a single enantiomer, so they would each elute as a single peak. So two peaks.

Thus, option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: perhaps the diols are the same compound, but that's not possible because their configurations are different.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers, and the mixture contains all four possible stereoisomers. But that would require each reaction to produce a racemic mixture, which isn't the case here.

So I think the correct answer is option C: 2 peaks in both HPLC columns.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, leading to the formation of diols. The products are then analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1**:  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a **cis epoxide** (EpoA).  
   - Acidic hydrolysis of EpoA produces a **trans diol**.  
   - The trans diol is chiral and exists as a single enantiomer due to the stereospecific nature of the reaction.

2. **Reaction 2**:  
   - (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a **trans epoxide** (EpoB).  
   - Acidic hydrolysis of EpoB produces a **cis diol**.  
   - The cis diol is also chiral and exists as a single enantiomer due to the stereospecific nature of the reaction.

3. **Combined Products**:  
   - The mixture contains two diastereomers: the trans diol (from Reaction 1) and the cis diol (from Reaction 2).  
   - Each diastereomer is present as a single enantiomer.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC**:  
     - Diastereomers are separated, but enantiomers co-elute.  
     - The mixture shows **2 peaks**, one for the trans diol and one for the cis diol.  

   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - Enantiomers are separated, but diastereomers are distinct.  
     - Since each diol is present as a single enantiomer, the mixture shows **2 peaks**, one for the trans diol and one for the cis diol.

### Conclusion:
The standard HPLC and chiral HPLC each show **2 peaks**, corresponding to the two diastereomers in the mixture.
