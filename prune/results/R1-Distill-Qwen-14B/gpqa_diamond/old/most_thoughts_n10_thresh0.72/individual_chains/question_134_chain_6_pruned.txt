Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. I remember that neutralization reactions are exothermic, so the enthalpy change should be negative.

The problem says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, wait, but wait. When you mix an acid with a base, they neutralize each other. But since there are multiple acids and a base here, I need to find out how they'll react.

First, I should figure out the moles of each acid and the base. Let me jot down the formulas and molarities.

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, so it can donate two H+ ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Since it's a group 2 metal hydroxide, each formula unit releases two OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

So total H+ from HCl and H2SO4:
HCl gives 0.1 moles H+.
H2SO4 gives 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles H+.
Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, when H+ and OH- react, they combine in a 1:1 ratio to form water. So:

H+ available: 0.28 moles
OH- available: 0.2 moles

The OH- will be the limiting reagent because 0.2 < 0.28. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but what happens to the excess H+? It will remain in the solution, so the reaction is not complete. But for the enthalpy calculation, I think we only consider the neutralization part, not the excess.

So the amount of H+ and OH- that actually neutralize is 0.2 moles each. So the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is typically around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), but wait, I think the standard value is about -57 kJ/mol for each mole of acid reacting with a base. Alternatively, I remember that the neutralization enthalpy is often given as approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid like HCl with a strong base like NaOH is about -57 kJ/mol. But since we have H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which are polyprotic and provide more ions, I need to compute based on the H+ and OH- moles.

Wait, no. The enthalpy change depends on the moles that actually react. So for each mole of H+ that neutralizes with OH-, it releases 57 kJ. So for 0
