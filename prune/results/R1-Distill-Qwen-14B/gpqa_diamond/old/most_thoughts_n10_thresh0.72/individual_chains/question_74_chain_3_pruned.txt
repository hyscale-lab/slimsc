Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question says that a certain atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the next 150 minutes? Or is it the remaining time after the 50 minutes have passed?

Wait, the setup is that we have 100 minutes as the time frame for a 32% decay probability. Then 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the remaining time from now is 150 minutes? Or does the next 150 minutes include the 50 that have already gone? That part is a bit confusing.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So the next 150 minutesâ€”I think that refers to the next 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes into the initial 100. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 50 +150 is 200, which is more than the initial 100 minutes. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no,
