Alright, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and under what conditions it's valid. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. Let me think through this.

Okay, the equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). I think this describes the dark current in a device operating in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. So SCLC implies that the space charge effects are dominant, meaning that the electric field is so strong that the space charge (the accumulation of charge near the contact) limits the current.

From what I recall, in the SCLC region, the current is limited by the ability of the charge carriers to move through the space charge region. This usually happens at higher voltages where the field is strong enough that the space charge can't be neglected anymore.

Now, the question is about the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. The options are A to D, each giving different conditions.

So, let's go through each option:

Option A says it's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, Ohmic contact implies that the potential barrier is zero, right? Or maybe it's a low barrier. And single-carrier means only electrons or holes contribute. Also, negligible drift current. Hmm, but in SCLC, isn't drift current the main component? Or wait, no, SCLC is when the space charge is so strong that the current is limited by that. So maybe in SCLC, the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion.

Wait, Mott-Gurney equation comes from the theory where the current is due to the space charge effect, which is a drift current. So if the option says negligible drift current, that would be a problem. Because then the current wouldn't be due to drift. Hmm. So if the option says negligible drift, that would invalidate it. So I think option A might be incorrect because it says negligible drift current, but Mott-Gurney requires that the current is due to drift in the space-charge region.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. Trap-free means no recombination centers, which is good. Single-carrier is fine. No carrier injection barrier—so Ohmic contact maybe? Because injection barriers are like what Schottky contacts have. So no injection barrier would be Ohmic. And negligible diffusion current—so the current is dominated by drift, which makes sense for SCLC. Because in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, which is a drift-limited condition. So in that case, diffusion is negligible because it's the drift that dominates.

Option C: Single-carrier device with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contact has a barrier, so there's a barrier for carrier injection. That might affect the current. Also, if it's a Schottky contact, then the device isn't Ohmic. So does the Mott-Gurney equation require Ohmic contacts? I'm not entirely sure. But I think when they say Ohmic, it's about whether the barrier is negligible. In Mott-Gurney, I think the model assumes that the device has a zero or negligible barrier height because if there's a significant barrier, it would affect the current through tunneling or other mechanisms. So maybe the model assumes that the contacts are Ohmic, so the carriers can easily inject. So option C has a Schottky contact, which might not fit. So the equation might not be valid if there are injection barriers.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Wait, Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier devices, right? Because when you have both electrons and holes, the physics changes, and the equation might not hold. So if the option says two-carrier device, that's probably incorrect because Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier (like only electrons or only holes) devices.

So, going back, Mott-Gurney equation is used when the current is space-charge limited, which is a drift-dominated regime. So conditions for validity:

- Single-carrier: because the equation involves μ (mobility), which is specific to the carrier type.

- Trap-free: because traps (like defects) would cause additional recombination and affect the current.

- Ohmic contact: to ensure that the carriers can easily inject into the semiconductor without significant barriers. Because if there's a large barrier, you might have thermionic emission or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, which are beyond the Mott-Gurney treatment.

- The current is due to drift, not diffusion. So diffusion current should be negligible. Because in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, which is a drift phenomenon.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: No carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic contact), trap-free, single-carrier. And negligible diffusion current. That sounds correct because it's single-carrier, trap-free, Ohmic (no barrier), and drift dominates.

Option A says 'negligible drift current'—that's the opposite of what we need. Because if drift is negligible, the current wouldn't be SCLC.

Option C has a Schottky contact which introduces a barrier. So not Ohmic. So the equation probably doesn't apply if there's a significant barrier because the Mott-Gurney assumes the contact is such that the carriers can move freely, i.e., no barrier.

Option D is two-carrier, which Mott-Gurney isn't for.

So the correct option should be B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. This regime is characterized by drift-dominated current due to the accumulation of space charge near the contacts, which limits the current flow. The equation assumes a single-carrier device (electrons or holes, but not both), trap-free conditions (no recombination centers), and negligible diffusion current, as the current is dominated by drift.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. This is incorrect because the SCLC regime requires drift current to dominate, not be negligible. If drift current were negligible, the Mott-Gurney equation would not apply.

- **Option B**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This is correct because the Mott-Gurney equation assumes single-carrier, trap-free, and drift-dominated conditions. The absence of a carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) aligns with the assumptions of the model.

- **Option C**: States that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. This is incorrect because a Schottky contact introduces a potential barrier for carrier injection, which contradicts the assumption of an Ohmic contact in the Mott-Gurney model.

- **Option D**: States that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, not two-carrier devices.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current, as described in **Option B**.
