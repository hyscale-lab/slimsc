Okay, so I have this problem about quantum mechanics, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0 at a particular time t. 

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of these operators. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's component in the state vector.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector has to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components should equal 1. Let me check that. 

Calculating the norm: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, wait, that's 6, not 1. So the state isn't normalized. That could be a problem. Hmm, but perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding. Because the probabilities depend on the normalized state. 

So, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be |ψ> / sqrt(6) = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the observable P is given as a matrix. Let me write that down. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So the matrix P looks like this:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, is P a Hermitian matrix? I think it should be because observables are Hermitian. Let me check. The matrix P is symmetric across the diagonal, because the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are both 1/√2, and similarly (2,3) and (3,2) are both 1/√2. So yes, P is Hermitian, so it's a valid observable.

Now, I need to find the probability that measuring P yields 0. To do that, I should find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product between the state vector and each of these eigenvectors. The probabilities are the squares of these inner products.

So, first, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Let's write the matrix P as:

[ 0       1/√2      0    ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2 ]
[0       1/√2      0    ]

Let me denote the eigenvalues as λ. So to find the eigenvalues, I'll solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ       1/√2      0    ]
[1/√2     -λ        1/√2 ]
[0        1/√2     -λ    ]

The determinant of this 3x3 matrix needs to be computed. Let me write the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix.

The determinant is calculated as:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- 1/√2 * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to expand along the first row.

So, the determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, more correctly, the determinant for a 3x3 matrix is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

a b c
d e f
g h i

So in our case, the elements are:

a = -λ, b=1/√2, c=0
d=1/√2, e= -λ, f=1/√2
g=0, h=1/√2, i= -λ

So determinant = a*(e*i - f*h) - b*(d*i - f*g) + c*(d*h - e*g)

Plugging in:

= (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ]
Second term: -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] → -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ)/2
Third term is zero.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2

Let me expand the first term:

= -λ³ + (λ)(1/2) + λ/2

Combine like terms: (λ/2 + λ/2) is λ, so:

det = -λ³ + λ

Set this equal to zero for eigenvalues:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ(1 - λ² ) =0 → 

So λ=0, or 1 - λ²=0 → λ= ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but since P is a Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues are real, which they are. Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0, so we're interested in the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0.

So now, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We have to solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the system is:

0 * v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 * v3 =0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

(1/√2) v1 + 0 * v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (v1 + v3) /√2 =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0 * v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 * v3 =0 → (1/√2) v2=0 → v2=0.

So from the equations, v2=0, and v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T.

This can be written as v1*(1, 0, -1)^T. So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1).

But to make it a unit vector, we can normalize it. The length squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2 → so the unit eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

So the projection operator for the eigenspace is |v><v|, where |v> is the unit eigenvector.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.

Wait, but wait, earlier I found that the state vector is not normalized. So first, I should normalize it.

Wait, the given state is [ -1; 2; 1 ]. Let me write ψ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Now, the eigenvector for λ=0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. Let me compute the inner product between ψ_normalized and this eigenvector.

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(6)) [ -1 * (1/√2) ) + 2 * 0 + 1 * (-1/√2) ) ]

Which is (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1/√2) + 0 - (1/√2) ) ] → (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-2/√2) ) ] → (1/sqrt(6)) * (-√2)

Wait, because 2/√2 is √2, so 2/√2 = sqrt(2). Wait, 2/√2 = sqrt(2) because (2)^2 =4, (√2)^2=2. Wait, 2/√2 = (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) / sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2). So 2/√2 is sqrt(2). So 2/√2 = sqrt(2).

So, 2/√2 is sqrt(2), but I have -2/√2, which is -√2. So the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-√2) → (-√2) / sqrt(6).

The absolute value squared is ( √2 / sqrt(6) )^2 → (2)/(6) )= 1/3.

Wait, because the square of the absolute value is [ (√2)^2 ] / [ (sqrt(6))^2 ] → (2)/(6) = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. So option C is 1/3.

Alternatively, let me re-calculate the inner product step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

ψ_normalized is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Eigenvector v is [ 1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

Inner product <v|ψ_normalized> is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] → because the second term is zero, and the third term is (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

So that's (-1)/(sqrt(12)) + (-1)/(sqrt(12)) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so each term is (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)) ). Adding two such terms gives (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

Wait, but the absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 → 1/3. So the probability is 1/3, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \) at time \( t \). The state of the system is given as \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \), and the observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The state vector \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After solving, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of measuring \( 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the normalized state \( |\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle \) and the eigenvector \( |v\rangle \):

\[
\text{Probability} = \left| \langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \right|^2.
\]

The inner product is:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( -1 + 0 - 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
\left| \langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

**Answer: C**
