Okay, so I'm trying to solve this ChIP-seq question. Let's see what I remember. The question is about why certain peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. 

ChIP-seq is a method used to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. The process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, using an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the attached DNA, and then sequencing those fragments. 

In this case, the experiment used PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation. I remember that PFA is a common crosslinker used in ChIP because it's efficient, especially for proteins that are harder to fix. But wait, sometimes another crosslinker is used. Oh right, DSG (disuccinimide) is another crosslinker, often used in conjunction with PFA for more efficient crosslinking of certain proteins.

The question says that when using PFA+DSG fixation, some ChIP peaks disappeared compared to just PFA. Hmm. So why would that happen? I think it has to do with the regions of the genome where the proteins are binding.

I remember that some regions of the genome are harder to crosslink or to pull down. For example, I've heard that certain areas, like active promoters and enhancers, are more accessible. Wait, but why would the peaks disappear when using a stronger crosslinker?

Wait, maybe the opposite. Let me think. When using a stronger crosslinker, perhaps it crosslinks proteins more effectively, but maybe in some regions, it's too much, leading to some issues during sonication or fragmentation. Or perhaps it's the other way aroundâ€”maybe certain regions are harder to fix with just PFA, but when you add DSG, it's better fixed, so the signal becomes stronger. Wait, but the question says the peaks disappeared when using PFA+DSG. So maybe in the PFA-only case, you had some false positives or some regions that were more efficiently crosslinked, and when you added DSG, which is a stronger crosslinker, perhaps it led to more efficient pulling down of the protein, but in some regions, maybe the antibody can't bind as effectively? Or maybe the regions that are more sensitive to crosslinking.

Alternatively, another angle: PFA crosslinks proteins to DNA, but maybe in some regions, the crosslinking is too efficient, making it hard to shear the DNA, leading to incomplete fragmentation. But
