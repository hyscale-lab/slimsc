Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out. Alright, the question is about reactions involving mCPBA and the products analyzed via HPLC. Hmm.

So first, what's mCPBA? Oh right, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. When an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Oh wait, but the stereochemistry might matter here.

The question has two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA and then aqueous acid. So, what happens in each reaction?

Epoxidation of alkenes typically proceeds with the formation of an epoxide. Now, the geometry of the starting alkene (E or Z) affects the product. Wait, in epoxidation, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene leads to different epoxide structures. But wait, I think mCPBA tends to cause an epoxidation with retention of configuration, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's a peracid which adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry.

Wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic ring-opening and then closing. For each diastereomer, does it produce the same or different epoxides? Let me think. 

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, when mCPBA adds, the peracid adds across the double bond. The addition is stereospecific. For an E-alkene, the peracid adds such that the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide? Or maybe it depends on the starting structure.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide. Wait, let me think: in epoxidation, the peracid adds across the double bond, and the two new oxygen atoms are added with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms on the same side as the original double bond's substituents. Wait, maybe not. Wait, no,
