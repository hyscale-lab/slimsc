Okay, so I have this question about a quasar and its observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Hmm, the question says there's a peak at 790 nm and the flux drops significantly below that. I think this has something to do with redshift. Oh right, when objects are moving away from us, their light gets redshifted. So if the observed wavelength is longer than emitted, that's redshift.

Wait, what's the typical emission line for quasars? I remember that the Lyman-alpha line is a prominent emission line in the optical for many astronomical objects. Lyman-alpha is emitted when an electron drops from the second energy level to the first in hydrogen, right? And its rest wavelength is about 121.6 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet. But in the quasar's spectrum here, the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared. So that's much longer than 121.6 nm. So the Lyman-alpha line has been redshifted.

Redshift (z) is calculated by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So plugging in the numbers: 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.5. Subtract 1, so z is about 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance to this quasar. Comoving distance depends on the universe's expansion and the cosmological parameters given. The parameters are Hubble constant H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m =0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_total =1).

I remember that the comoving distance, often denoted as D_C, is a function of the integral involving the scale factor and the Hubble parameter. The formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

Wait, but for a flat universe, Omega_total = 1, so any curvature effects are accounted for, but in this case, the dark energy and matter densities sum to 1, so Omega_k must be zero. So the integrand is correct.

So to compute D_C, I need to compute the integral from 0 to z of 1 / E(z') dz', where E(z') is sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

But wait, calculating this integral exactly would require some computation. Since I don't have a calculator here, I'll need to approximate it or remember some typical values. I think for a given redshift z, there are standard lookup tables or approximate expressions for the comoving distance.

Alternatively, I can recall that for certain z values, like z=1, the comoving distance is roughly 2 Gpc, but that's for H0=70. Wait, no, wait, let me think again. Wait, for z=1, using the formula, the comoving distance is approximately (c/H0) * (1/(sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda)) )? No, no, that's the integrand. The integral is more complicated.

Wait, I think it's better to look for a standard approximation. For a flat universe with matter density Omega_m and dark energy Omega_lambda, there's an approximate formula for the comoving distance. Alternatively, using the look-up table or some standard values.

Wait, I think the comoving distance at z=5.5 would be a certain number of gigaparsecs. Let me think about typical scales. The Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, which is about 2.3e-18 s^-1.

The comoving distance formula is D_C = (c / H0) * integral(0 to z) dz' / E(z').

c is about 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 is (3e5)/(70) ≈ 4285.7 Mpc. Which is about 4.285 Gpc. So D_C is this multiplied by the integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz'.

So the integral is about what? For z=5.5, let's compute E(z') for various points.

E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7).

At z=0, E= sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1. So at low z, E is ~1, so the integrand is 1. So the integral starts at 1, but as z increases, E increases.

Wait, but for high z (like z>1), the matter term (0.3*(1+z)^3) dominates the dark energy term. So for z=5.5, 0.3*(1+5.5)^3 = 0.3*(6.5)^3 = 0.3 * 274.625 ≈ 82.3875. And 0.7 is much smaller, so E(z)≈ sqrt(82.3875)≈9.077. So the integrand is 1/9.077≈0.11.

Wait, so the integrand starts at 1 when z'=0, then decreases as E increases.

But integrating from 0 to z=5.5, how do I approximate this? Maybe using some approximations for higher redshifts.

Alternatively, I recall that the comoving distance for a flat universe (Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7) at z=5 is about 11 Gpc. At z=6, it's about 12 Gpc. Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right because I'd expect higher z to have higher distance.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the lookback time. Alternatively, maybe I can refer to some standard distance values.

Wait, another approach: for a given z, the comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) multiplied by the integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz'. So if I can approximate this integral.

For a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the integral can be approximated using certain methods or by using an average
