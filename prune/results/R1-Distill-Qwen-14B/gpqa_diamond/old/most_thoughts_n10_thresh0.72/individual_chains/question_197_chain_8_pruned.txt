Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think through the steps. 

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different organic compounds, so I need to figure out which one fits the data and the reaction.

First, let me look at the spectral data given.

Starting with the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹.

I remember that IR peaks can indicate certain functional groups. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm⁻¹ is likely due to an -OH group or maybe an -NH stretch. But since it's a broad peak, maybe it's an -OH. But wait, the peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. 

Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, which fits the first broad peak. But their carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm⁻¹. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720, which matches. But the 1720 might be a ketone as well, but let's think more about the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a high chemical shift. In carboxylic acids, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm. But if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an exchange with water or something. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but it's a triplet or something, not sure. But the broadness suggests it's an -OH, so maybe a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but sometimes a phenolic -OH can be around 5 ppm, but maybe if it
