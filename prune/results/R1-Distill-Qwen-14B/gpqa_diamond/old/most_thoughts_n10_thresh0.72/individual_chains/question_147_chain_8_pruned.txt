Okay, I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says.

So the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Hmm, annihilation usually involves a particle and its antiparticle, but here it's producing two pairs of particles. Wait, protons and antiprotons annihilate to produce other particles. I remember that in annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved.

The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh right, that means its speed (v) is much less than the speed of light (c). So maybe I can approximate using non-relativistic equations for the antiproton. But when it annihilates, the products might be moving relativistically. Hmm, but the question is about the velocity of particle A, so perhaps I need to consider relativistic effects for them.

Wait, the mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. But I need to figure out the velocity of A. So I think I'll have to use conservation laws here—probably energy and momentum.

Let me think about the setup. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Assuming the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe I can model this as the system where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it, but their speeds are low. Or wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is low, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at some low speed.

Wait, the initial system is p + p̄. Let me consider the center-of-momentum frame because that's where energy calculations are often simpler. But if the antiproton is moving slowly relative to the proton, maybe the center of mass is moving a bit. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the initial total momentum and energy.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial momentum is small. If the antiproton is moving much slower than the proton is at rest, but wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v, then the total initial momentum is just m_p v, since the proton contributes nothing. Hmm
