Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and there's this equation given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle affects the total wavefunction's symmetry, so the parity comes into play here.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So T is the isospin. The options give different transitions, and we need to find which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are labeled from A to D, each showing a transition like 1S0 -> something plus a particle.

First, let me recall the basics. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1=1 → S=0. L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. The J is the total angular momentum, so for 1S0, J=0.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When the particle X is emitted, the system goes from the initial state to a final state. Let's denote the initial NN state as the 1S0 state, and the emitted particle as X. The final state is the NN system in some state, and the X particle.

Wait, but the problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Interesting. So the initial T must be considered. Wait, but the initial state is 1S0, which I think refers to the orbital and spin state of the NN system. Wait, maybe the initial state's isospin isn't given, but since the problem is about the final state, perhaps T is being considered for the NN system.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Let me think about what that implies about the spin and other quantum numbers. For two nucleons (like a deuteron), the spin can be 0 or 1. But the state is 1S0, which suggests that the spin is 0 (since 2S+1=1 → S=0), and the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since it's S, which is spherically symmetric). So S=0, L=0, J=0 for the initial state.

So in the initial state, the NN system is in a spin-singlet state (S=0), with zero orbital angular momentum. So the total angular momentum J is 0.

Now, the particle X is emitted, so the total angular momentum and parity should be conserved. Also, the isospin might come into play with the Pauli exclusion.

The problem says that the final NN state has T = 0. So the isospin of the NN system is 0. Which makes sense because for two nucleons, the isospin can add up in a certain way. For example, in the deuteron, the isospin is 1, but if the nucleon-nucleon state is in a singlet state, perhaps their isospin combines to 0.

The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the context of this equation. Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So perhaps this equation is about the symmetry of the wavefunction under exchange of the two nucleons. Since Pauli statistics require the wavefunction to be antisymmetric for identical fermions, which would include the NN system.

Wait, but in this case, the NN system is the bound state. So when they emit a particle, the emitted particle X is part of the final state. So the total system includes the NN and X.

Wait, no, perhaps the initial state is the NN system in 1S0, and then they emit X, so the final state is the NN system plus X. But the problem says "the final NN state has T(NN) = 0". So perhaps the NN system after emission has certain quantum numbers.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The initial state has angular momentum J=0. After emission, the total angular momentum must be conserved, so the sum of the angular momenta of the NN system and the emitted particle X must equal J_initial = 0. But wait, the initial state is the NN system, and after emission, the NN system plus X must have total angular momentum (vector sum) equal to 0. Hmm, but actually, the initial state is the NN system, and they emit X, so the total system (NN + X) must have the same total angular momentum as the initial state. So if the initial state has J=0, the total J for the final state (NN + X) must also be 0.

But the problem is to determine which partial wave is not permitted. Partial waves are characterized by the orbital angular momentum quantum number l, which relates to the angular distribution of the emitted particle. So each option gives a transition, e.g., 1S0 → 7D1 + p. The lowercase letters indicate the angular momentum state of X: s (l=0), p (l=1), d (l=2), f (l=3), etc.

So for each option, the emitted particle X has a certain l (from its angular momentum state). So the final state (NN + X) must have total angular momentum J=0.

Additionally, parity must be conserved. The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. For the initial state 1S0, L=0, so parity is 1.

When the particle X is emitted, the parity of the final state is determined by the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. The parity of the final state should be the same as the initial state.

Wait, but the system is the NN plus X. So the parity of the initial state (before emission) is the parity of the NN system, which is 1 (since L=0). The parity after emission is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X. Because the orbital angular momentum l of X contributes a factor of (-1)^l to the parity.

Wait, the overall parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of X and the parity from the orbital angular momentum. So parity is P = (-1)^l * parity_X.

The initial parity is 1 (since L=0, parity is (-1)^0=1). The final parity should be the same. So 1 = [parity_NN_final] * [parity_X] * (-1)^l_X.

Wait, no: the parity of the final state (NN + X) is the product of the intrinsic parity of the NN and X and the orbital angular momentum factor. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The parity of a state is given by the product of the intrinsic parity (given for the particle X here as -1) and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between the two particles (the NN and X system). Wait, no, in emission, the orbital angular momentum is that of the emitted particle relative to the system. So the orbital part is l (the angular momentum state of X), so the parity would be (-1)^l * parity_X.

But wait, the parity of the initial state is the parity of the NN system, which is 1. The parity after emission should also be 1, because parity is conserved. So the parity of the final state (NN + X) is:

parity_initial = parity_final → 1 = [parity_NN_final] * [parity_X] * (-1)^l.

Wait, but the parity of the final NN system is determined by their L and S. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity of the entire process is conserved. So the initial parity of the NN system is 1. After emission, the parity of the final state (NN + X) must also be 1.

The parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1. So the parity of the X is -1, and the orbital angular momentum part is (-1)^l. So the total parity change would be (-1)^l * (-1) = (-1)^(l+1). 

But wait, the parity of the entire system is conserved. So the initial parity (1) must equal the final parity.

The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of the X particle and the orbital angular momentum. Hmm, but the NN system's parity is (2S+1)L' → wait, no, the parity is (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to structure this.

The initial state is the NN system. Before emission, the parity is (-1)^L_initial. For 1S0, L_initial =0, so parity is 1.

After emission, the NN system is in some state with L_final and S_final, and the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l relative to the NN system. So the total parity of the system after emission would be:

parity_NN = (-1)^(L_final)
parity_X = (-1)^(l) * intrinsic_parity_X
So total parity after emission is [(-1)^(L_final)] * [(-1)^l * (-1)].

Because the intrinsic parity of X is -1.

So total parity after emission is (-1)^(L_final + l + 1).

But parity must be conserved, so this must equal the initial parity, which is 1.

So:

(-1)^(L_final + l + 1) = 1 → (-1)^(L_final + l + 1) = (-1)^0 → L_final + l + 1 must be even.

So L_final + l + 1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → L_final + l ≡ 1 mod 2.

That's one condition.

Another condition comes from angular momentum conservation.

The total angular momentum of the initial state is J_initial = 0. The final state has the NN system with angular momentum J_NN and the emitted particle X with angular momentum J_X. But because X is emitted, the total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must still be J_initial = 0. So J_NN and J_X must combine to zero. But J is a vector, so this requires |J_NN - J_X| ≤ 0 ≤ J_NN + J_X. The only way for their sum to be zero is if J_NN = J_X = 0, but that's probably not the way. Wait, wait no—when particles are emitted, the total angular momentum is the sum of the initial and the emitted particle's angular momentum. Wait, no, the initial total angular momentum is zero because the NN system has J=0. After emission, the total system (NN + X) must have J=0 as well, because angular momentum is conserved.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of adding the angular momenta of the NN system and the X particle. The initial state has J=0, so the final state (NN + X) must have J=0. So the vector sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero. That's only possible if J_NN and J_X are the same and opposite in direction. But since angular momentum is quantized, this would require J_NN = J_X and their directions are opposite, but that's not possible because J can't be negative. Alternatively, perhaps they must both be zero.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true because J_NN and J_X can combine to zero vectorially. For example, J_NN = 1 and J_X =1 could combine to 0 if their directions are opposite. But in reality, the sum must be zero vectorially, which would require J_X = -J_NN, but since J is a magnitude, that's impossible unless both are zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual angular momenta, so J_NN + J_X = 0. That would require J_NN = J_X =0. Because any other combination would result in a non-zero vector sum.

So if J_NN and J_X are both zero, then their sum is zero. So for the final state, the NN system must have J_NN =0, and the emitted particle X must have J_X=0.

So the NN system in the final state has J=0, which implies that their total angular momentum is zero. So the spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN system must combine to J=0.

So for the NN system, J = L' (orbital) + S' (spin).

But for two nucleons, their spin can be 0 or 1. If their spin is 0, then L' must also be 0 for the total J to be 0. If their spin is 1, then L' must be 1 to allow J=0 (since 1 + 1 can't make 0 unless opposite, but that's not possible with angular momentum addition). Wait, no, the addition of angular momenta is vectorial. For S=1 and L=1, the possible J's are 0,1,2. So to have J=0, it's possible if L and S combine to 0.

Wait, but the NN system in the final state must have J=0. So their spin S' and orbital L' must add to J=0. So possible combinations are:

Case 1: S' =0, L'=0 → J=0.

Case 2: S'=1, L'=1, and their vector sum gives J=0.

But the first case is possible, and the second requires specific conditions.

Now, going back to the problem statement, the final NN state has T=0. So their isospin is zero. Isospin for two nucleons (protons and neutrons) can be 1 or 0. If they are in a singlet state, their isospin is 0. So the final state has T=0, which aligns with the first case where S'=0, L'=0. Because if S' is 0, then the spin is singlet, and the isospin for two nucleons would be 0. So that makes sense.

So in the final state, the NN system has S'=0 and L'=0. So their total angular momentum is J=0. And the emitted particle X must have J_X=0 as well, because the total final J is 0.

Wait, but X is a particle emitted, so its spin is part of its own angular momentum. For X to have J=0, it must be a spin-0 particle. But looking at the options, the particles emitted are p (proton, spin 1/2), s (probably a scalar, spin 0?), f (could be spin 3/2?), etc. Wait, the options are:

A) ... + p → X is a proton (spin 1/2)
B) ... + p → X is a proton
C) ... + f → X is a fermion, maybe a neutron or something else
D) ... + s → X is a scalar, spin 0.

Wait, but this is confusing. The options indicate the angular momentum state of X with letters like D1, S1, etc. So the 'p' in the options refers to the orbital state, not the spin. So the emitted particle's spin isn't directly given, but for X to have J_X=0, its spin must combine with its orbital angular momentum l to make J_X=0. So the spin and l must be such that their sum is zero.

Wait, but that's only possible if the spin is zero and l=0, because any spin would require l to be such that their vector sum is zero, which is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for X to have J_X=0, its spin state must combine with l to give zero. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the fact that the emitted X must have J_X=0 for the total J to be zero. So the angular momentum of X is l, and its spin is s. So the total J_X is the vector sum of l and s. So for J_X=0, l and s must be zero. But that's only possible if X is a scalar (s=0) and l=0. Because any non-zero l and s would require that their vector sum is zero, which is not possible except for l=0 and s=0.

Wait, but the options don't specify the spin of X. They only give the orbital angular momentum state. So the only way for J_X=0 is if X has spin 0 and l=0. Because l is the orbital part, and the spin part must also be zero.

So in the options, the emitted particle X must have l=0 and spin 0. Let's check the options:

Looking at the options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p → X has l=1 (since D is l=2, but wait, no, the notation is for the emitted particle. Wait, in the options, the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. So for option A, X is in D1 state? Wait, no, the options are written as 1S0 → X + Y, where Y is the emitted particle. Wait, the notation is like 1S0 → 7D1 + p: so the emitted particle's angular momentum state is p, which is l=1. Because p is the letter for l=1.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

The options are written as 1S0 → something + particle. The particle is denoted by a letter, which represents the angular momentum state. So for example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the particle X has an angular momentum state of p, which is l=1. So X's orbital angular momentum is l=1.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that for X's J to be zero, its orbital angular momentum must be l=0 and spin must be zero. But if X has l=1, then its orbital part is 1, and unless its spin is such that the total J_X is zero, which is impossible because spin is half-integer or integer. So perhaps this line of reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because the total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must be J=0. So the sum of the NN system's J and X's J must be zero. But the NN system has J=0, and X has J_X. So 0 + J_X = 0 → J_X must be zero. So X must have J_X=0, which requires that the sum of its orbital angular momentum and spin is zero. So l (orbital) plus s (spin) must sum to zero vectorially.

So for X to have J_X=0, l must equal the spin in the opposite direction, which is only possible if l = s and opposite in direction. But for particles, spin is either integer or half-integer.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Let me think of specific cases.

If X is a scalar boson, its spin s=0. Then J_X = l. So for J_X=0, l must be zero. So X must be emitted with l=0.

If X is a spin-1 boson, then J_X could be 1, 0, or other values depending on l. But for J_X=0, l must be 0, but that's not possible because l=0 would give J_X=1, which can't sum to zero. So perhaps X must be a scalar boson with l=0.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option has X with a certain l. So if X's J must be zero, then for each option, does X's l allow J_X=0?

Looking at the options:

Option A: X is p, which stands for l=1. So X has l=1. Then, if X's spin is 1/2 (like a proton), then J_X could be from |1 - 1/2| to 1 + 1/2 → 1/2 to 3/2. So J_X can't be zero. So this would be impossible.

Option B: X is p (l=1). Same reasoning. Can't have J_X=0.

Option C: X is f, which is l=3. X's spin is whatever, but to get J_X=0, l and spin must combine to zero. For example, if X has spin 3, then l=3 and spin 3 can combine to J=0, but that's unlikely. Wait, but that depends on the specifics.

Wait, but perhaps there's another approach. Since the initial state has J=0, the final state (NN + X) must also have J=0. So the total angular momentum of the NN system plus X is zero. So the angular momentum of X must be the same as the NN system but in opposite direction. But since J is a magnitude, the only way is both have J=0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. J is a vector, so the vector sum must be zero. So if the NN system has J=0, then X must have J=0 as well. So the only way is for X to have J=0.

So X must have J=0, which is the sum of its orbital angular momentum l and spin s, so l and s must combine to zero. The only way for their vector sum to be zero is if l = 0 and s=0. Because any non-zero l or s would require the other to be non-zero in a way that their vectors cancel, which isn't possible unless both are zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because some particles can have J=0 with non-zero l and s. For example, a pion has J=0, l=0, and s=0. But a photon has J=1, l=1, s=1. So perhaps for X to have J=0, l and s must satisfy l = s, but that's not necessarily always possible.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of each option:

Each option gives the emitted particle's angular momentum state (l), and we can determine whether J_X can be zero.

But if X must have J=0, then for each option:

Option A: X is p, l=1. X's spin must be such that when added to l=1, the total J is zero. So s must be 1 (since 1 + 1 can sum to 0, but only if their vectors are opposite). But s=1 is possible for a spin-1 particle. But wait, spin-1 plus l=1 could sum to J=0? Because when you add two angular momenta, say j1 and j2, you can get any value from |j1-j2| to j1+j2. So for j1=1, j2=1, possible J=0,1,2. So it's possible for J=0. So for option A, X could have J=0.

Wait, but the spin of X is not given. The options only give the l of X, not its spin. So perhaps the spin is determined by the particle type.

Wait, in the options, the particles are denoted by letters like p (proton), s (scalar), f (fermion?), etc. Let's think about their spins.

Proton (p): spin 1/2.
Neutron (n): spin 1/2.
Scalar (s): spin 0.
Fermion (f): spin 1/2 or 3/2.

Wait, but in the options, the particles are X, and their type isn't specified beyond their angular momentum state. So perhaps for each option, I can only consider the orbital part (l) and the intrinsic parity.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should focus on the parity condition.

Earlier, I had an equation: L_final + l + 1 must be even → L_final + l must be odd.

In the final state, the NN system has L_final =0 (since the final state is T=0 and S'=0, so L' must be 0 as per earlier reasoning). So L_final =0.

So substituting into the equation:

0 + l +1 must be even → l +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → l ≡ 1 mod 2.

So l must be odd.

Looking at the options, the emitted particle's l must be odd.

Option A: p → l=1 → odd → allowed.

Option B: p → l=1 → allowed.

Option C: f → l=3 → allowed.

Option D: s → l=0 → even → not allowed.

Ah, so option D has l=0, which is even, violating the parity condition. So it's not allowed.

Wait, but let me double-check. The parity condition requires that L_final + l +1 is even. L_final is 0, so 0 + l +1 must be even → l +1 even → l is odd.

So in option D, l=0 (s state), which is even, so 0+0+1 =1 → which is odd. So 1 is odd, which would make parity (-1)^1 * (-1) = (-1)^2=1. Wait, no, wait earlier:

Wait, the parity of the final state is [parity_NN_final] * [parity_X] * (-1)^l.

parity_NN_final is (-1)^L_final → L_final=0 → parity is 1.

parity_X is given as -1.

So total parity is 1 * (-1) * (-1)^l → (-1)^(l+1).

This must equal the initial parity, which is 1.

So (-1)^(l+1) = 1 → exponent must be even.

So l +1 must be even → l must be odd. So l must be 1,3,5, etc.

So:

Option A: l=1 → allowed.

B: l=1 → allowed.

C: l=3 → allowed.

D: l=0 → not allowed.

So option D is not permitted.


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The goal is to determine which partial wave is not permitted, given that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0 and conservation of angular momentum and parity must be satisfied.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State**:  
   The initial state is 1S0, which implies:
   - Total spin \( S = 0 \),
   - Orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \),
   - Total angular momentum \( J = 0 \).

2. **Final State**:  
   After emitting particle X, the final state consists of the NN system and the emitted particle X. The final NN state has:
   - Isospin \( T(NN) = 0 \),
   - Total angular momentum \( J(NN) = 0 \) (since \( T(NN) = 0 \) and the NN system is in a singlet state).

   The total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must also be \( J = 0 \) due to conservation of angular momentum.

3. **Parity Conservation**:  
   The initial parity of the NN system is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = 1 \). After emission, the parity of the final state is:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^L \cdot (-1)^l \cdot \text{intrinsic parity of X},
   \]
   where \( L \) is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system, \( l \) is the orbital angular momentum of X, and the intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. Since parity is conserved, \( P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \). Substituting, we get:
   \[
   (-1)^L \cdot (-1)^l \cdot (-1) = 1.
   \]
   For the final NN state, \( L = 0 \), so:
   \[
   (-1)^0 \cdot (-1)^l \cdot (-1) = (-1)^{l+1} = 1.
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   l + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad l \equiv 1 \mod 2.
   \]
   Thus, \( l \) must be odd.

4. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:  
   The total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must be \( J = 0 \). Since the NN system has \( J = 0 \), the emitted particle X must also have \( J = 0 \). This requires that the orbital angular momentum \( l \) and spin of X combine to give \( J = 0 \).

5. **Analysis of Options**:  
   Each option specifies the emitted particle X and its angular momentum state \( l \):
   - **Option A**: \( l = 1 \) (p state). \( l \) is odd, so parity is conserved. Allowed.
   - **Option B**: \( l = 1 \) (p state). \( l \) is odd, so parity is conserved. Allowed.
   - **Option C**: \( l = 3 \) (f state). \( l \) is odd, so parity is conserved. Allowed.
   - **Option D**: \( l = 0 \) (s state). \( l \) is even, so parity is not conserved. Not allowed.

### Conclusion
The partial wave not permitted is the one with \( l = 0 \), corresponding to Option D.

**Answer: D**
