Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember from my notes that phase shifts are involved in scattering amplitudes. The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄, and tells me to ignore the rest. The incident beam direction is along, I think, the scattering angle θ = 0 degrees. The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at that direction.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude comes into play here. I think the general expression for the scattering amplitude f(l, k) involves a sum over all the angular momentum states l with their respective phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like:

f(k,θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (δ_l + ... ) e^{iδ_l} (something with Legendre polynomials?) ]

Wait, no, maybe I should think of the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f can be written as a sum over l of these terms. Specifically, each term involves (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) times the corresponding spherical Bessel function or something like that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(k,θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ]

where the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum. But wait, in this case, the problem says to ignore rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, so
