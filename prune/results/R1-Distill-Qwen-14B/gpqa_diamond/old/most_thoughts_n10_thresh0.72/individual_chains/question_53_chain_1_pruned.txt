Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, I remember. The carbonyl group (C=O) in esters appears around 1740-1700 cm⁻¹, and there's also the ester oxygen which might show up around 1050-1100 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch. So that's a key point—this compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me break them down. Two are aromatic-H, two are vinyl-H (so possibly from a double bond, maybe adjacent to the ester?), and two for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals, which suggests that the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups.

Hmm, so the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester. Let me think about possible structures. Ester groups are usually something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, wait. Esters are R-O-CO-R. Oh right, the general structure is RCOOR'. So, for the ester group, there's a carbonyl connected to an oxygen, which is connected to another R group.

Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the two substituents could be an ester group and another group. Or maybe both substituents are parts of the same ester? Hmm, not sure. Wait, the ester is a substituent on the benzene ring, so maybe the other substituent is another group like a methyl or something else.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals. Two aromatic H signals. A benzene ring usually has symmetry, so if it's di-substituted, the number of unique H environments depends on the substituents. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the ring would have two H environments: the two Hs ortho to substituents, and the two para, but wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite, so each H in the ring would be equivalent in pairs. Wait, perhaps the substituents are in a meta position? Or maybe one substituent is in a position that causes the ring to have different H environments.

Wait, the aromatic signals are two. Let me think: for a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are opposite, so the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs. But wait, wait, if the substituents are both ester groups, but that's unlikely because the problem states it's a di-substituted ring. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is another group.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two types of Hs. For example, if the substitu
