Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That sounds a bit complex. Let me visualize it.

First, the structure has a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl groupâ€”so that's a CH(OH)CH2 group attached. Wait, no, hydroxymethyl is -CH2OH, right? So 3-(hydroxymethyl) would be a methyl group with an OH attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 3. Then, at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is an allyl group, I think. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond starting at C1. So it's CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the ring at position 5.

Wait, but I might be getting the structure wrong. Let me sketch it. The cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group at position 1. So numbering the ring: positions 1 is carbonyl, 2 is next, then 3 (hydroxymethyl), then 4, 5 (prop-1-en-2-yl), 6.

So the initial structure is a cyclohexanone with substituents at 3 and 5.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. But wait, in this case, where would it deprotonate? The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). The OH is acidic. When treated with a strong base like NaH, it would deprotonate the OH to form an alkoxide. Then, benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So it would perform an alkylation on the oxygen.

So after deprotonation, the hydroxymethyl becomes a good nucleophile (the alkoxide). Then, benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) would react in an SN2 reaction, replacing the bromide with the benzyl group. So the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether. So the product 1 would have a benzyl group attached to the oxygen of the hydroxymethyl, making it OCH2Ph.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. So the hydroxymethyl is at position 3, so after alkylation, it becomes 3-(benzyl-O-CH2)cyclohexanone? Or more accurately, 3-(benzyloxy)methylcyclohexanone.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting group is -CH2OH at position 3. Deprotonating with NaH gives -CH2O^- Na+. Then benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) would attack, so the benzyl group (PhCH2-) would attach to the oxygen. So the new group would be -OCH2Ph, right?

So the product 1 is 3-(benzyloxy)methylcyclohexan-1-one. So the structure is cyclohexanone with a benzyl ether group at position 3 and the prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 5.

But wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-, but attached to the ring as a substituent. So that could be an allyl group.

Moving on
