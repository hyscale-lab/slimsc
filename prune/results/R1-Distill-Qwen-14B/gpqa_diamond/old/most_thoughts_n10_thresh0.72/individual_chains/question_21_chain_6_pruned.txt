Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and it's asking about tautomerism and optical isomerism in two different compounds. Hmm.

First, let me read the question again carefully. The question states that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers, which can be either constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the structure, while stereoisomers have the same structure but different spatial arrangements. 

Then the question gives two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound does NOT show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about determining which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Alright, let's tackle part A first. 

Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between different structures (tautomers) through a movement of atoms, typically involving the position of double bonds or hydrogen atoms. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group can tautomerize to an enol form. But not all compounds with carbonyl groups can do this because it depends on the structure.

Benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene with two ketone groups. It exists as 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,2-benzoquinone. Wait, but the question just says benzoquinone, so perhaps it's the 1,4 form which is more common. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Does this allow for tautomerism? Hmm, I think that for tautomerism, the molecule must have a conjugated system where a hydrogen can shift. Let me think. Benzoquinone with two ketone groups—each is a carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, the two ketones are across from each other. Can they undergo enol tautomerism? Well, in the case of 1,4-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are para to each other. If one of them were to tautomerize, would that be possible?

Wait, another thought. Tautomerism usually involves adjacent protons. Like in a diketone, such as cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which has three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions. So, if the molecule has multiple carbonyl groups adjacent to each other, like in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, that's a tricyclic structure. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So positions 1, 3, and 5 each have a carbonyl group. That leaves positions 2, 4, and 6 as CH2 groups or something similar. Wait, no, wait, in 1,3,5-trione, the ring has alternating single and double bonds? No, wait, the carbonyl groups are at 1,3,5, so the ring might be fully conjugated. Hmm.

Wait, but for tautomerism, the compound needs to have a proton alpha to the carbonyl. So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at every other position. Are there any alpha hydrogens? Let's imagine the structure. Each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So between each ketone, there are CH2 groups? Or maybe in a chair-like structure, but wait, in a six-membered ring, each ketone would have adjacent CH2 groups. So, each ketone is like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO- etc. Wait, no, wait. Let me think of the actual structure. If it's a cyclohexane ring with three ketones at 1,3,5, then each ketone is at every other carbon. So, between carbonyls, there's a single carbon—like, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but that's cyclohexane, so the chain wraps around.

Wait, no, cyclohexane has six carbons. So positions 1,3,5: so carbon 1 is a carbonyl, 3 is another, 5, and then 6 would be next to 1. So, the structure would have carbonyls at 1,3,5—so the ring alternates between carbonyl and CH2 groups. That would make the structure something like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but in a ring. So each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to a carbonyl, meaning each has two alpha hydrogens. So, that
