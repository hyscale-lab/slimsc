Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involve some kind of addition. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide ions in the presence of an acid catalyst.

So, for the cyanohydrin formation, the ketone (butan-2-one here) would attack the cyanide ion. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but the reaction usually needs an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen so that the nucleophilic attack can happen. So reagent A should be an acid. Looking at the options, H3O+ is an option in A and B. Alternatively, maybe something else like H2SO4 or HCl as a catalyst, but the options have H3O+.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes, when you're doing such additions, you might use a strong acid to generate H+ ions. So perhaps H3O+ is the right reagent for A. So reaction A is adding NaCN and H3O+ to butan-2-one to form the cyanohydrin.

Then the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and water to form the corresponding butanoic acid. Oh, this looks like a hydrolysis reaction. The nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

How does that happen? Well, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, typically H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and heat, but sometimes other acids like HCl might be used. Alternatively, in basic conditions using something like NaOH and then acid workup.

Wait, but looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile was hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The starting material is a secondary alcohol (the -OH is on the same carbon as the CN and the other substituents), so upon hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The starting material is the cyanohydrin already. The structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the molecule has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Wait, but when that nitrile is hydrolyzed, what happens? Let me think.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis typically goes through an amide intermediate. But if the nitrile is attached to a carbon that's also bearing an alcohol group, perhaps the reaction conditions matter. Alternatively, maybe the conditions involve a strong acid.

Looking at the options for reagent B, the options are either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). So in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O and reagent B. Oh wait, the reaction is written as 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) â†’ the acid. So B is the reagent used, and H2O is the solvent or part of the reaction.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions. To hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you usually need strong acidic conditions. For example, using HCl with heat. Alternatively, sometimes you can use a strong acid like H2SO4 and heat.

So looking at the options, for reagent B, the options are either HCl or acetic acid. If the reaction is hydrolysis, then HCl would be a better choice than acetic acid because it's a stronger acid and can provide the necessary H+ ions for the reaction to proceed.
