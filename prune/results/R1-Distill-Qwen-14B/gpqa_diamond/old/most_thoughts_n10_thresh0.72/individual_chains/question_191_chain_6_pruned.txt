Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. It's a multi-step synthesis question, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's see what I can remember.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so a CH2OH attached). And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as an allyl group, right? So that's CH2CHCH2 attached to the ring, but wait, the substituents. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH2)- attached? No wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Wait, let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but the position is on the 2nd carbon. Wait, maybe it's like CH2=C(CH2-)... Hmm, no, maybe it's (CH2)2CH with a double bond. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C-CH2- where the substituent is on the second carbon. So it's CH2- attached to the ring and a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure would be cyclohexane with a ketone, a hydroxymethyl at C3, and an allyl group (CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond) at C5. Maybe I should draw it, but since I can't, I'll try to imagine it.

Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide. NaH is a strong base, typically used for deprotonating things like alcohols to form alkoxide ions. So the starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (OHCH2-) at C3. NaH would deprotonate
