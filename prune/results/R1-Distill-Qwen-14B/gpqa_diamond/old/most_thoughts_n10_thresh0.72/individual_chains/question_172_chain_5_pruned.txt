Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states to temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels being equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T). So, n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T) ). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Because higher energy levels would have fewer particles if it's thermal equilibrium. So, n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). 

In this case, the excited state is the higher energy level. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let's call the number of excited atoms in star_1 as n1 and star_2 as n2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1 / n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ). Because for each star, the ratio depends on their respective temperatures. Wait, no. Wait, actually, each star's excitation depends on its own temperature. So for star 1, the ratio of excited to non-excited is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star 2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The ratio n_upper/n_lower is equal to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), right? So for star_1, this ratio is R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and for star_2, R
