Alright, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on the signal-to-noise ratio. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method, I think. But here, the key factors are the S/N ratio and exposure time.

The question says a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to find out which stars meet this criterion.

The stars given are labeled a to f. Let's go through each one.

Option a) Canopus. I know Canopus is a bright star, probably in the southern sky. Its apparent magnitude is around 0.5. Since brighter stars (lower magnitude) are easier to detect, probably Canopus is detectable. But wait, how does apparent magnitude translate to S/N? I think the ESPRESSO's sensitivity depends on the star's brightness. Brighter stars would give higher S/N.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, also quite bright, but maybe not as bright as Canopus. Its apparent magnitude is around 2. But wait, Polaris is a variable star. I'm not sure about its exact brightness. Anyway, if Canopus is 0.5, Polaris at 2 is dimmer. So maybe it's detectable, but less so than Canopus.

Options c, d, e, f are all stars with absolute magnitude 15 mag, but different distances. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

Wait, let me compute each:

c) 10 pc. So m =15 + 5 +5 log(10/10) =15 +5+0=20. So apparent magnitude is 20? That's very faint. But wait, I think I might have messed up the formula. Oh wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. So for d=10 pc, it's M +5*(1) -5 = M. So m=15. So that's a 15 mag star. Wait, that doesn't seem right. No, wait, the formula is correct. Because when d=10 pc, log(10) is 1, so 5*1=5. So m = M +5 -5 = M. So m=15. So a 15th magnitude star is quite dim. I think ESPRESSO's sensitivity is better for brighter stars. So a 15 mag star might not give a high enough S/N in 1 hour.

d) 200 pc. So m=15 +5*log10(200) -5. Log10(200)=2.3010. So 5*(2.3010)=11.505. So m=15 +11.505 -5 =21.505 mag. So about 21.5 magnitude. That's even fainter than c, so probably not detectable.

e) 5 pc. m=15 +5*log10(5) -5. log10(5)=0.69897. 5*0.69897≈3.495. So m=15 +3.495 -5 =13.495. So about 13.5 mag. Hmm, still pretty dim. I'm not sure if that's bright enough. 

f) 50 pc. m=15 +5*log10(50) -5. log10(50)=1.69897. 5*1.69897≈8.495. So m=15+8.495-5=18.495. So about 18.5 mag. Also quite dim, probably not detectable.

Wait, but what's the typical S/N ESPRESSO can get for stars of certain magnitudes? I think ESPRESSO is sensitive down to about magnitude 20 in some cases, but maybe for higher S/N, it's better. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the relation between S/N and magnitude.

I remember that the S/N ratio generally scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux (brightness). The formula is S/N = constant * 10^(-0.4 * m
