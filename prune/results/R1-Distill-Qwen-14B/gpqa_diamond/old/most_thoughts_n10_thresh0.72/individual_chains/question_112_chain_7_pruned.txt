Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that in the standard basis, |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1). 

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, that would mean A is a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Hmm, that looks familiar. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, so the operator we're considering is (hbar/2) sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator. So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of this operator.

Alternatively, since the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are ±1. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis.

I remember that the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then square the coefficients to get the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I should normalize it because it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The inner product is <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Because |a|^2 + |b|^2 for orthogonal states.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2 -i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So total is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Expressing |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But |alpha> is also [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So equate the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (a + b) = (1 + i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Equation 2: (a - b) = (2 - i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Let me add equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) 
= (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14))

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So b = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )
= [ (-1 + 2i ) ] / sqrt(14 )

Wait, let me compute that again.

From equation 1 and 2:

Adding:
a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Adding: 2a = [3 + 0i] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
a = (3 * sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(14)/7? Wait, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)/7, but maybe it's better to write it as sqrt(2/7).

Wait, no, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)/7? Let me check:

sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(14)/7.

Because sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(7), you get sqrt(14)/7. Yes.

So a = (3) * sqrt(2) / (2 * sqrt(7)) ) = [3 * sqrt(14)] / (2 * 7) )? Wait, perhaps it's easier to just leave it as 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, let me compute a:

sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(14)/7. So 3 * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3 * sqrt(14) / (2 * 7 )= 3 sqrt(14) /14. Hmm, but maybe it's better to compute the magnitude squared for the probability.

The probability of measuring |+x> is |a|^2, and |-x> is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3 * sqrt(2) )/(2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, no, wait
