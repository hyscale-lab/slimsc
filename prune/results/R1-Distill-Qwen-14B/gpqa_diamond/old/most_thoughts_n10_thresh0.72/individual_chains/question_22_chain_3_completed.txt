Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant under different conditions. The first part is about thermodynamics, and the second about kinetics. I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to the cell potential, which is the thermodynamic aspect. The rate of reaction would be the kinetic part.

So the statement is: "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions."

We need to fill in the blanks with 'weaker/stronger' and 'faster/slower' respectively. The options are A to D combinations.

First, let's think about the thermodynamic part. The strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). The higher the E°, the stronger the oxidant. So, under basic conditions, how does the oxidizing power of oxygen compare to acidic conditions?

I remember that the reaction for oxygen in basic solution is different from acidic. In acidic solution, O2 is reduced to H2O. The standard reduction potential for that reaction is around +1.23 V. But in basic solution, the same reaction would involve OH- ions instead. The half-reaction for O2 in basic solution is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-; the E° for this is also positive, I think about 0.401 V. Wait, that's lower than the acidic case. Wait, no, wait. Or am I mixing it up?

Wait, no, in standard conditions, the O2 to H2O in acidic is E°= +1.23 V, and O2 to OH- in basic is actually E°= +0.401 V. So, in acidic, the E° is higher, meaning O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic conditions. So in basic solution, oxygen is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic conditions.

So the first blank should be 'weaker' because in basic, E° is lower. So that would make the first part 'weaker oxidant in basic solutions.'

Wait, wait. The statement says "oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic." So the first part is about basic solution. Since in basic, E° is lower than in acidic, that means in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant than in acidic. So, in basic solution, it's a weaker oxidant compared to when it's in acidic.

So the first part would be 'weaker.'

Now, the second part is about kinetics. The question is, does O2 react faster or slower in acidic solutions? Kinetics relate to the rate of reaction, which depends on factors like activation energy, concentration, temperature, and the reaction mechanism.

I remember that the O2 molecule is more soluble in basic solutions. Because in acidic solutions, there are more H+ ions, which could affect the solubility. Wait, no, wait: actually, O2's solubility is influenced by pH. At lower pH (acidic), the solution has lower OH- concentration. I'm not exactly sure about the effect on O2's solubility. Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic versus basic has different activation energies.

Another angle: the reaction in acidic solutions might involve H+ ions, which could make the reaction proceed faster because H+ is a good proton donor. Or maybe the mechanism is different. For example, in acidic conditions, the O-O bond might be more easily broken because of the presence of H+ ions.

Wait, I recall that in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 is more kinetically favorable because the reaction conditions (like the presence of H+ and H2O) allow for a faster reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the activation energy is lower in acidic conditions. So O2 would react faster in acidic solutions.

Wait, but wait—another thought. In basic solutions, the concentration of OH- is high. Since O2 reacts with water (forming OH- and H2O), perhaps the presence of OH- in basic solution facilitates the reaction, making it faster. Or maybe in acidic, the reaction is slower because of higher H+ concentration interfering with the reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic solutions is faster because the H+ ions can help stabilize the transition state. For example, in the reduction of O2 to H2O (in acidic), the reaction might have a lower activation energy because of the H+ ions.

Wait, I remember that in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 is often faster because H+ can act as a catalyst. For instance, the reduction of O2 to H2O is more favorable in acidic conditions, and it proceeds more quickly. So, in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster.

So, putting it together: thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions.

So the first blank is 'weaker' and the second is 'faster.' Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are:

A) stronger – faster

B) stronger – slower

C) weaker – faster

D) weaker - slower

So, the correct combination would be 'weaker' and 'faster', which is option C.

Wait a second, let me double-check my initial thought about the E° values. In acidic solution, the standard reduction potential is higher, making O2 a stronger oxidant. So in basic solution, the E° is lower, so O2 is a weaker oxidant. So, correct. So first part is weaker.

And if O2 reacts faster in acidic, the second part is faster. So the correct combination is weaker and faster, which is option C.


To determine the correct combination of terms, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in thermodynamic and kinetic contexts.

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis (Oxygen as an oxidant):**  
   The strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). In acidic solutions, the reduction of oxygen to water has an E° of +1.23 V, while in basic solutions, the reduction of oxygen to hydroxide has an E° of +0.401 V. Since the E° in acidic solutions is higher, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions and a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Therefore, the first blank should be filled with "weaker."

2. **Kinetic Analysis (Reaction rate):**  
   Kinetics depends on factors like activation energy, concentration, and reaction conditions. In acidic solutions, the presence of H⁺ ions can stabilize the transition state and lower the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. Additionally, the reaction mechanism in acidic conditions (e.g., reduction of O₂ to H₂O) is often more favorable kinetically compared to basic conditions. Thus, the second blank should be filled with "faster."

3. **Combining the Results:**  
   From the above analysis, the correct combination is "weaker" for the thermodynamic part and "faster" for the kinetic part. This corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
