Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is related to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, I'm not exactly sure how to approach this with three different solutions mixing together.

First, I need to figure out what's happening when these solutions are mixed. I think neutralization reactions typically produce water and a salt. So, I should probably write out the possible reactions here. But wait, since there are three reactants, maybe I should look for which ones can form a neutralization reaction.

Looking at the substances: HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the acids will react with the base. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will donate OH- ions. 

Wait, I need to think about the stoichiometry here. When these solutions are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. The total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 should be calculated, and the total OH- from Ba(OH)2 should be calculated. Then, determine which one is the limiting reagent because the limiting reagent will dictate how much neutralization occurs.

Let me get the moles of each substance. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume (in liters).

For HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+. So 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, the total H+ available is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- available is 0.2 moles. 

In a neutralization reaction, H+ + OH- → H2O. So the OH- will be the limiting reagent because there's 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.28 moles of H+. That means all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So, the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0
