Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with light and moving media, things get a bit tricky because of relativity and how light behaves in different frames of reference. Let me try to break this down.

The question states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving away from the observer? No, wait, the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the light is moving towards the observer as well. Wait, no—wait, the setup says the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is in the same direction, so the beam is moving towards the observer as well. But the glass is also moving in the same direction as the beam. Hmm, no, wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So imagine the beam is moving to the right, and the glass is moving to the right as well. But the observer is in the lab, which is stationary. So the glass is moving towards the observer? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused about the direction.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So if the beam is moving towards the observer (i.e., in the direction from the glass towards the observer), then the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Or, maybe the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of coordinate systems.

Let me consider the lab frame. In the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. So if the observer is at rest, and the glass is moving towards them, then the glass's velocity is v towards the observer. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, so the beam is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, no, wait. No, the beam is inside the glass. So the glass is moving, and the light is propagating within it. The problem is about the speed of the light in the glass as measured by the lab frame observer.

I think I should first find the speed of light within the glass in the glass's rest frame. Oh right, in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n, because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium (v_medium = c/n).

But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So I need to find how the light's speed transforms when the medium is moving. This is probably related to the relativistic velocity addition formula, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use classical addition.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the frame relative to the first. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused about which frame is which.

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass.

So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me recall the formula correctly. The velocity u' in the new frame (lab) when the frame S is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, no, wait. If S is the glass frame, and the lab is moving at velocity v relative to S, then in the lab frame, events that are moving at u in S would be observed as u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, I think it's the other way around. The lab is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. So from the glass's perspective, the lab is moving at velocity -v. So in the glass frame, the light is moving at u = c/n towards some direction. We need to find u', the speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass.

So the formula is u' = [u + v] / [1 + (u v)/(c²)].

Wait, no, that's when the frame S is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So if the lab is moving at velocity -v relative to S (the glass's frame), then to find the speed in the lab frame, we plug into the formula u' = [ u + v ] / [1 + (u v)/(c²)].

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of direction. Let's say the glass is moving to the right at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is moving to the right as well in the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n to the right. So to find the speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass, we use the velocity addition formula.

So u' = [u + (-v)] / [1 + (u (-v))/c² ].

Wait, no, because the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass frame. So the formula transforms the velocity from the glass frame to the lab frame. So the lab frame has velocity v with respect to the glass frame.

So, if in the glass frame, the light is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (i.e., to the right), then in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the light's speed u' is given by (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, no, wait. If the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass frame, then from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at velocity v. So when we apply the velocity transformation, it's from the glass frame to the lab frame.

Wait, another approach: Let's suppose in the glass frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is to the right. But the glass itself is moving at v in the lab. So from the lab's perspective, the light's speed is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)).

But wait, that can't be right because if the glass is moving at speed v, and the light inside is moving at speed u = c/n in the same direction, then the lab would measure the light as moving faster. But wait, because in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Oh wait, that's a key point. So even in the lab frame, light should still travel at speed c.

Wait, wait a second. In the glass frame, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving at v relative to the lab, the speed of the light in the lab frame must still be c, because that's a fundamental postulate of relativity. So all observers measure the speed of light in a vacuum as c, but here the light is in a medium, so the speed is different. Wait, but does that hold?

Wait, no, in the case of a medium, the speed of light is different. So the relativity of velocity doesn't directly apply here because the medium is moving. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up frames here.

Wait, so if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at speed u = c/n in the glass's frame, then the lab would measure the speed as u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²).

So substituting u = c/n, we get u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) v ) /c² ) = (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c)).

Hmm, let me compute this.

Numerator: (c/n + v) = (c + n v)/n.

Denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c)/(n c + v) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (c + n v) * n c / [ n (n c + v) ) ].

The n's cancel out in numerator and denominator.

= (c + n v) * c / (n c + v).

Wait, so that's (c (c + n v)) / (n c + v).

Wait, let's expand numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is c² + c n v.

Denominator is n c + v.

Hmm, can I factor anything here? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps factor c from denominator: c(n + v/c).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor n from denominator: n(c) + v.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out c from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: c (c + n v).

Denominator: v + n c.

Wait, that's the same as c (c +n v) / (n c +v) ).

Wait, but that doesn't look like any of the options given.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n +v).

Option B: 1.

Option C: (1 +n v)/(n - v).

Option D: (1 -n v)/(n +v).

Wait, none of these are matching what I have so far. Because in my calculation, I have c (c +n v)/(n c +v). But the options don't have any factor of c, assuming c=1.

Oh right, the question says to take c=1. So c=1. So let's redo the substitution with c=1.

So, u' becomes (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Because substituting c=1 into the expression, we have:

u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

But wait, looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which matches.

But wait, hold on. Because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, according to the lab frame, would the speed of light still be (1 +n v)/(n +v) ?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the velocity addition formula.

Wait, another approach: in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is u = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab would measure the light's speed as u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, so substituting u = c/n and c=1:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) v ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Which again gives option A.

But wait, another point. Relativity says that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c. But here, the light is in a medium (glass), so its speed is different. So the lab frame would measure the speed as (1 +n v)/(n +v).

But wait, another thought: if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light in the glass is moving with speed c/n in the glass frame, then in the lab frame, the speed is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²) as I've done.

So according to this, the correct answer is option A.

But wait, let me check for v=0. If the glass isn't moving (v=0), then the speed of the light should be 1/n. Let's plug v=0 into option A: (1 +0)/(n +0) = 1/n. Correct.

Another check: if n=1 (vacuum), then u'= (1 +v)/(1 +v) =1. Which is correct because in vacuum, regardless of the medium's motion, the speed is c=1.

Another check: if v is very small compared to c (n=1, v<<1), then u' ≈ (1 +v)/(1 +v) =1, which is consistent.

Wait, but what about when the glass is moving in the opposite direction? Let's say the light is moving to the left in the glass, and the glass is moving to the right. Then u would be -1/n (since it's opposite direction) in the glass frame. Then u' in lab would be (-1/n +v)/(1 + ( (-1/n)v )/(1) ). But in our problem, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so it's positive.

So I think my derivation is correct, leading to option A.


To determine the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory observer, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and it is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is propagating through the glass. The speed of light in a medium is \( c/n \) in the glass's rest frame, where \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem). 

To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame.
- \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab observer is:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches **Option A**. To verify, consider special cases:
1. If \( v = 0 \), the speed reduces to \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct for light in a stationary medium.
2. If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed becomes \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), consistent with the invariance of the speed of light in a vacuum.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
