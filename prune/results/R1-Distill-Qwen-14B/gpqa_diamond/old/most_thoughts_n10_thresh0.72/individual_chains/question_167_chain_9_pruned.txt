Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. And N is the normalization constant sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). Oh right, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase. The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, so first I need to compute N. Let me plug in phi and alpha. Phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) which is -1. And exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5). So N squared is 1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5). Let me compute that numerically.

Exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. Wait, but wait, N has to be the square root of the expression, so yes, around 0.6275.

But wait, I'm not sure if I should proceed. Because if N is sqrt(1 + ...), and that expression under the square root must be positive. In this case, 0.3935 is positive, so it's okay.

Next, the problem is about calculating the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure del_b. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but how do I compute this? Well, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (or quantum relative entropy) is being used here. But I think relative entropy measures distinguishability between two states. However, in this case, it's being used as a measure of non-Gaussianity by comparing the state to
