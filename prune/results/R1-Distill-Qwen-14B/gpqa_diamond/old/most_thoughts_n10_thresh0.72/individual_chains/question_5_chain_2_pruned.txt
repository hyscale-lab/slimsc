Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says I need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made.

The operator P is given in terms of its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think the operator P itself is a vector operator, which probably should be expressed in terms of these components. Oh wait, right, the operator P is likely the spin operator. Because in spin systems, the components Sx, Sy, Sz have similar structures. So for spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, right? So the operator P is the spin operator, and each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix times ħ/2. Similarly for Py and Pz.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the direction is in the x-z plane so φ would be 0 or π, but maybe it doesn't matter since it's arbitrary? Wait, the direction is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Or maybe it's (something else). Hmm, wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ
