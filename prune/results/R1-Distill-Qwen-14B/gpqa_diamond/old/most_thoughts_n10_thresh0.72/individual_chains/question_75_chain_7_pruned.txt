Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the mouse model. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The setup: The researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G. They added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. They selected antibiotic-resistant colonies but can't overexpress the protein.

They looked at the plus strand construct sequence. Hmm, I should probably look for any issues in the sequence that could prevent proper expression.

So, the options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Missense mutation in HA sequence. If the HA tag has a mutation, the protein might not be recognized for purification, but the construct's expression issue is about not being expressed, not affinity purification. So maybe not A.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. Let's look for stop codons. The DNA sequence is in the plus strand, so looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the sequence... Let me scan through. The beginning is ATG, which is start. Then after some bases, I see GAA, which is glutamic acid. Then GGA, GAG, etc. Wait, looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking further down: I see a lot of CGG, CTG, etc. Wait, in the middle, near the end of the sequence, let me check.

Wait, the last part: ...GAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the very end is GAGTGA. Let me parse that. The last codons before the end are GAG, which is glutamic acid, then TGA. Oh wait, TGA is a stop codon. So the sequence has a TGA in the middle of the coding region?

Wait, let's look again. The construct is the coding sequence for the HA-tagged GADD45G. So the stop codon in the construct would be the end of the HA and the GADD45G. But this sequence has a TGA in the middle. Let's see.

Wait, the construct starts with ATG (start codon), then the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence. If the plus strand's coding sequence includes a TGA, that would be a premature stop codon, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early. So the protein would be shorter than expected, maybe not even functional.

So in the sequence provided, is there a TGA anywhere? Let me look.
