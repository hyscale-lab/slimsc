Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to parse through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

So, the scenario: A researcher wants to study the GADD45G protein in mice. They're using a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression. The goal is to see if this protein plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They've added a coding sequence for the protein and modified it by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. So, that should be on the beginning part of the protein.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So, something's wrong with the construct.

Looking at the given sequence, it's the plus strand of the construct. I'm supposed to find the reason why the protein isn't being expressed correctly.

The options are A to D. Let's go through each.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm. A missense mutation would change an amino acid. If the determinant is at the N-terminus, maybe it's causing the protein to misfold or be recognized as foreign and degraded. But the question is about overexpression. If the HA sequence has a mutation, perhaps the epitope isn't there, but would that prevent expression? Or maybe it would just affect antibody detection but not expression levels. Alternatively, maybe it's causing a frameshift or a stop codon. Wait, but the HA sequence is part of the coding region. So a missense mutation would change an amino acid in HA. Not sure if that would prevent expression. Maybe not the primary issue here.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That suggests a premature stop codon. If the coding sequence has a stop codon (like TAG, TGA, or TAA) somewhere in the middle, the ribosome would stop early, producing a truncated protein. Looking at the given DNA sequence, perhaps there's a stop codon early on. Let me check the sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let's look for any in-frame stop codons before the end.

Looking through the sequence, I can scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets. Let's go through it:

Looking for TAA: So every three nucleotides, starting from ATG.

Wait, the sequence ends with TGA at the very end. The last part is ...AGGCTA C C GAGTGA.

Wait, the very end is ... TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So in the DNA, that's TGA in the plus strand. So in the mRNA, it's the same sequence, so the mRNA would have TGA as the last codon, producing a stop.

But wait, where is the stop codon? In the DNA, the TGA is at the end. So the coding sequence ends with TGA as the stop codon. So that's correct; the gene would end with TGA, which is a stop codon.

But wait, the GADD45G coding sequence would have its own stop codon. Adding the HA determinant shouldn't affect that
