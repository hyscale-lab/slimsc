Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's read through it step by step and see if I can figure it out.

The question is about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

Hmm, I think I should break this down piece by piece. Let's start with the reaction part. Substance X reacts with liquid Y. Common violent reactions between substances include things like metals reacting with acids. So maybe Y is an acid or a base?

The gas released, W, has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For instance, H2O has 8 neutrons and 8 protons (since O is 8 protons, H is 1 each). Wait, no, if the molecule is H2O, each molecule has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons in H2O: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 8. So that's not equal. Hmm. What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's the common isotope, but wait, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps one of the elements in X has a heavier isotope, like Cl-35 instead of Cl-37 maybe? Not sure yet.

Wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think of possible diatomic gases. Maybe something like O2 or N2? O2 has 8 protons each, so total 16 protons in a molecule. Neutrons: each O has 8, so 16 in O2. So protons 16, neutrons 16. So that's equal. Oh wait, O2 would fit because each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for O2, each O is 8p,8n. So O2 has 16p and 16n. So that fits W's description.

So gas W is O2? Or maybe another molecule. Alternatively, maybe CH4? No, because that's a hydrocarbon. Wait, what about CO? Carbon has 6p, 8n? Or 6p, 6n if it's the most common isotope. Wait, no, the most common isotope of carbon is C-12, which has 6p and 6n. So CO would have 6p (C) + 8p (O) =14p. Neutrons would be 6 (C) +8 (O)=14. So in CO, protons and neutrons each are 14. So that fits too. Hmm, but which one is more likely?

Wait, the reaction between X and Y produces O2. So let's think about reactions that produce oxygen gas. For example, heating a peroxide or something. But the reaction is violent, so maybe a metal reacting with water or an acid.

Wait, another thought: if Y is water, and X is a metal, like sodium or potassium. When they react, they produce H2 gas. But in this case, W is O2... Wait, maybe it's a reaction that produces O2. Like the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, but that's usually not a violent reaction. Wait, but if Y is something like H2O2 (but that's a liquid), and X is maybe something that catalyzes its decomposition, but I don't know...

Alternatively, what if Y is a salt solution, and X is something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is a strong base and X is a metal, but that might produce H2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate and X is an acid, which would produce CO2. Oh, that's possible. So if X is an acid and Y is a carbonate, then when they react, CO2 gas is released. Let's think about that.

So, if W is CO2, then each molecule has 6p +8p=14p, and 6n +8n=14n. So it fits the same number of protons and neutrons.

So if Y is a carbonate (like Na2CO3) and X is an acid (like H2SO4), then the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Na2CO3 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, gas W is CO2. That could fit.

But wait, the problem says that the reaction is violent. So maybe it's a more reactive acid or a strong base?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, Y is an acid, and the reaction produces H2 gas. But earlier I thought W was O2, but maybe I should think again.

Wait, the problem says Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an element with a heavier isotope. For example, maybe it's using Cl-35 or Cl-37, but let's see.

In the reaction, when X reacts with Y, it produces gas W, which is O2 or CO2 or H2, etc. Let's see what else happens. A precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees
