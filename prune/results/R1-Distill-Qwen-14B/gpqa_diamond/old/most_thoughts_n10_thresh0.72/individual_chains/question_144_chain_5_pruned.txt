Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all on the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, which makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distances are very small.

Alright, so I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like L = v * τ, where v is the velocity and τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, how do I get τ from the given parameters?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relationship is Γ = ħ / τ. Since Γ is the total decay width, the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of energy·time. So I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me write down the constants.

H-bar, ħ, is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant in terms of eV·s is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. So converting that into GeV·s would be 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Yep.

So, let's compute τ first. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really small. But particles with short lifetimes decay quickly, so maybe that's correct.

Next, I need the velocity v. How do I find that? I think I can use the relativistic energy relation. The total energy E of the particle is given as 8 GeV, and its rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the energy E is much larger than m, so the particle is likely moving at a speed close to c.

The energy in relativity is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but units-wise, I need to make sure E and m are in compatible units. Since both are in GeV, and c² has units of (GeV^2)/(GeV^2) because m is in GeV/c² multiplied by c² gives GeV. So perhaps I don't need to worry about c² in the units here.

So γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667. That's a significant gamma factor, so the speed is close to c.

The velocity v can be found using β = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that. γ is about 6.6667, so γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/γ² is about 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887, which makes v ≈ 0.9887c. Close enough to c, which is good because we might approximate v as c for a rough calculation. But let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, maybe I can use the approximation for high γ. When γ is large, like much greater than 1, β ≈ 1 - (1/(2γ²)). Let me check: using γ=6.6667, 1/(2*(6.6667)^2)=1/(2*(44.4
