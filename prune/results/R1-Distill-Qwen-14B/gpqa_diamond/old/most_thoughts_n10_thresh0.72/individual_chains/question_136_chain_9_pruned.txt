Okay, I've got this question about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So, the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r squared radially from the origin. That means the magnitude of f is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field within a sphere of radius R.

Wait, I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence relates to how a vector field spreads out or converges. So the divergence of a vector field can tell us about sources or sinks. But how do I compute this integral?

The field is only radial, so in spherical coordinates, f(r) can be written as f(r) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction. Given that the magnitude is 1/r², so f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

I think to find the divergence, I should use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂, the divergence is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/sinθ) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ r)) dA_φ/dφ ].

But in this case, the field only has an r-component, so A_θ and A_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r). Let me substitute A_r with 1/r².

Wait, no, A_r is (1/r²). So plugging in:

div f = (1/r²) [ d/dr (r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Simplify inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So div f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, but that can't be right because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, the integral over a volume that includes the origin might not be zero. Oh, wait, but the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at r=0.

Wait, the field is f = (1/r²) r̂. That looks similar to the electric field of a point charge, except for the sign. The electric field of a charge Q is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (Q/r²) r̂. And I remember that the divergence of E is rho/(ε₀), where rho is the charge density. For a point charge, rho is a delta function at the origin.

So, if this field is analogous to an electric field due to a charge at the origin, then the divergence of f would be a delta function scaled by some factor.

Wait, but in the problem, the field is given as 1/r². Let me compute the divergence again more carefully.

So, divergence in spherical coordinates for A_r-only field:

div A = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r )

A_r = 1/r². So,

r² A_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0
