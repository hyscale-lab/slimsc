Okay, I have this question about nucleophilicity and arranging the given nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the question lists five nucleophiles: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate. I have to order them from most reactive (most nucleophilic) to least reactive.

Wait, nucleophilicity depends on the solvent, right? Oh yeah, in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent. In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is influenced by how well the nucleophile is solvated. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in such solvents because they're less stabilized by solvation.

So, the key here is the strength of the base. The stronger the base, the more nucleophilic it is in polar protic solvents. Because in such solvents, weaker bases can be more stabilized by solvation, making them less reactive.

Let me list the given nucleophiles and think about their basicity:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's the conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol. Cyclohexanol is a secondary alcohol, so its conjugate base is more stabilized than, say, ethoxide. But wait, the substituent here is methyl, which is electron-donating. So the cyclohexanolate would be a stronger base than, say, acetate, but weaker than something like ethanethiolate?

Wait, no, wait. The basicity of alcohols' conjugate bases: The more stable the base, the weaker the base. So, more stabilized (like if the conjugate acid is strong), the weaker the base. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The strength of the base is the ability to donate electrons. If the conjugate acid is strong, then the base is weak. Because a strong acid has a weak conjugate base.

But when considering alcohols, the conjugate base is the alkoxide. The more stabilized the alkoxide is, the weaker the base. For example, tert-butoxide is a stronger base than methoxide because it's less stabilized. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait: Wait, actually, in the gas phase, larger, more stabilized alkoxides are weaker bases. But in solution, it's different because of solvation.

Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let's think in terms of pKa of the conjugate acid. The lower the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the acid, and the weaker the conjugate base.

So, for the given compounds:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: The conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol. What's its pKa? Alcohols typically have pKa around 16-20. Maybe 4-methyl would be similar. Wait, cyc
