Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. It seems like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbon that has both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse that again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. The substituent at position 1 is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is -(CH2)- attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And also, there's a formyl group on the same carbon? Wait, no. Let me think again. The main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. The 1-position (where?) would be the same carbon as the formyl group, perhaps. So the substituent is at the 1-position, which is the same as the formyl carbon.

So the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. That would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane with a formyl group on carbon 1. Also attached to carbon 1 is a CH2 group, which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So it's like:

Cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached at C1. Also, at C1, there's a CH2 group attached. That CH2 has two substituents: one is a cyclohexyl group (another cyclohexane ring attached to CH2), and the other is a hydroxyl group (-OH). So the structure is something like:

O=CH-C(H)(cyclohexyl)(OH) attached to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, but the substitution on the carbon with CHO would be CHO, CH2(cyclohexyl), and OH. So maybe the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl has those substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached, which is then attached to the formyl group. So maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a CH2CHO group and another substituent.

No, actually, perhaps the correct way is that the main chain is cyclohex
