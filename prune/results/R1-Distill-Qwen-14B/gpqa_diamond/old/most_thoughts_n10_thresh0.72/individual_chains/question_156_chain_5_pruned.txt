Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says a chemist performs two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used as oxidizing agents, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions are followed by aqueous acid. Oh right, that's the acid workup. So the epoxide probably undergoes ring-opening under acidic conditions.

Epoxide ring-opening under acid catalysis typically involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then the ring opens, leading to a carbocation. The carbocation can then undergo rearrangement, like hydride shifts, if it's more stable that way.

Wait, but the initial epoxide formation depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. Because mCPBA adds across the double bond in a specific way. Oh right, mCPBA adds the oxygen across the double bond in a trans fashion, but wait, no, more accurately, the epoxidation via mCPBA is stereospecific. The peracid adds an oxygen across the double bond, but the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, no, the peracid adds in a way that the oxygen adds to opposite faces. Wait, I think the epoxidation by mCPBA is a peracid addition, which occurs with a certain stereochemistry. So for the (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxides that form would be different.

Let me think. (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on opposite sides. So when mCPBA adds, which is a peracid, it would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are on opposite faces. Wait, but actually, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the peracid's oxygen adds to each carbon, leading to the formation of an epoxide. The geometry of the starting alkene would influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no, the initial alkene geometry (E or Z) determines whether the epoxide will be cis or trans. Wait, no, actually, the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the reaction conditions. For mCPBA, which is a peracid, the epoxidation is typically a syn addition. Wait, wait, noâ€”epoxidation via peracids is a trans addition. Because the peracid attacks the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen bonds form on opposite sides. So, the peracid approaches the double bond from the same face, leading to the oxygen adding to opposite sides
