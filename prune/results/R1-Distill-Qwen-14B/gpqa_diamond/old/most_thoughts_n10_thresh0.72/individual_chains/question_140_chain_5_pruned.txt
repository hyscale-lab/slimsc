Okay, I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. Let's read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating gives B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out what each of these substances could be.

First, the reaction of X with Y. Violent reactions could involve things like metals reacting with acids or bases, maybe an acid-base reaction. But the gas released has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2 gas: each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron? Wait, no. Wait, for H, the most common isotope is H-1 (protium) with 0 neutrons. So maybe another gas. What about NH3? No, that's a liquid. Oh wait, maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 (protons: 6, neutrons:6), but the molecule is CO2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, no, the gas's molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like CH4? No, that's a gas but. Wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons must be equal. So, for example, if the molecule is H2, the total protons would be 2, total neutrons 0. No, that's not equal. What about O2? Each O has 8 protons, so O2 has 16 protons. O has 8 neutrons each in the common isotope. So O2 would have 16 neutrons. 16 protons and 16 neutrons? That's equal. So O2 is a possible gas W.

Alternatively, maybe another gas. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe CO? No, because CO has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in 12C) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So the molecule would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons? Wait, 6+8=14 protons, and 6+8=14 neutrons. So yes, CO would fit. Hmm, but CO is a gas.

But in the problem, when X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. So maybe it's a reaction that produces a solid and a gas. For example, a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas. But earlier I thought about O2. Alternatively, perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid to produce CO2 gas.

Wait, but the gas molecule having equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible molecules.

Possible molecules:

- H2: protons=2, neutrons=0 â†’ no. Doesn't match.
- O2: protons=16 (8 each
