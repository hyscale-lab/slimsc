Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about titration of acetic acid with NaOH, and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, right.

First, let me read the problem again. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 mL. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized and at the equivalence point.

Wait, okay, so when they say 25% titration, does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH? I think so. Because in a titration, the percentage titrated is the fraction of the analyte that has reacted with the titrant.

First, let me think about the initial dilution. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we dilute it with equal volume. So the new concentration would be half, right? Because M1V1 = M2V2. Since V1 and V2 are the same (20 mL each), M2 is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, for the titration. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

So the stoichiometry is 1:1. That means each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. The volume is 40 mL (since 20+20), and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 25% of this acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of acetic acid reacted = 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. Therefore, moles of acetic acid remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed would be the same as the moles of NaOH added, which is 0.00025 mol.

So now, the solution is a buffer solution. Because we have a weak acid (acetic acid) and its conjugate base (acetate). To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log ([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, the pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let me calculate pKa. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 1.85e-5's pKa. Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So pKa is 4.733.

So for the 25% titration point, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. So log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. So around 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Option B has 3.17. So 4.26 is in option A and D. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 mL, right. So when we add NaOH, the total volume increases. But for the buffer solution, the concentrations are based on moles divided by the total volume, which is 40 mL plus whatever volume of NaOH has been added.

Wait, wait, but wait. 25% of the acetic acid has been titrated. So the moles are as I calculated before. But the total solution volume isn't just 40 mL anymore; we've added some NaOH. Let me think.

Wait, when you titrate, you add the NaOH solution, which has its own volume. Oh, right. So when you add V mL of NaOH, the total volume becomes 40 mL + V mL. But for the Henderson equation, if the solution is dilute, perhaps the volume cancels out because both concentrations are divided by the same total volume. Let me check.
