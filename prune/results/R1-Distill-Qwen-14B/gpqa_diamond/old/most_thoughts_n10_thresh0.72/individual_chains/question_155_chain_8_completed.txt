Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So, I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared. But wait, the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, right? So that might make things easier.

The state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, in the P_z basis, the state |ψ> is represented by these components. Let me denote them as [a, b, c] = [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2].

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I think I just need to compute the expectation value. Since the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Looking at P_z's matrix, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues because it's diagonal. So the eigenvalues are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ for the first, second, and third basis states respectively.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be |a|² * (ℏ) + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ℏ).

Let me compute each term. |a|² is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * ℏ. |b|² is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2, multiplied by 0, so that term is 0. |c|² is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, so 1/4 * (-ℏ) is -ℏ/4.

Adding them up: (1/4)ℏ + 0 + (-1/4)ℏ = 0. Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That might simplify things.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is just the square of each eigenvalue, because each basis vector is an eigenstate. So the eigenvalues of P_z² would be (ℏ)^2, 0^2, (-ℏ)^2, which are ℏ², 0, ℏ².

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is |a|² * ℏ² + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * ℏ².

Calculating each term: 1/4 * ℏ² from a, 0 from b, 1/4 * ℏ² from c. Adding them gives (1/4 + 1/4)ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ².

Now plug these into the uncertainty formula: ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ℏ²) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = (ℏ) * sqrt(1/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ℏ/sqrt(2). So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait a second, let me double-check. The state is given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the probabilities are |each component squared|.

Yes, so |a|² is 1/4, |c|² is 1/4. So each contributes 1/4 * (ℏ)^2. Sum is 1/2 ℏ². The expectation of P_z is zero because the positive and negative contributions cancel. So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = ℏ / sqrt(2). So option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state represented by the column vector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$ in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the first, second, and third basis states, respectively.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
