Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

Alright, the setup is that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which together weigh 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases is formed, which is passed through some tubes. The results are that tube 1 (with Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 grams, tube 3 (with red-hot copper) gains 0.80 grams, and tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) doesn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are numbers between 13 and 19.

Hmm, let's think about what's happening here. So, the salts are heated, and they decompose, producing gases. The setup with the tubes is designed to detect and capture these gases.

So, let's see. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong drying agent. It probably absorbs water vapor because Mg(ClO4)2 is a deliquescent salt that can trap water. So if the gases passed through have water, it would be absorbed here. The weight gain of 3.60 grams would be from the water vapor, I think.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change, so maybe no CO2 was present. Because if CO2 were present, it would react with Ca(OH)2, forming CaCO3 and water, which would increase the weight. Since it didn't change, perhaps CO2 wasn't in the gas mixture.

Wait, but wait, maybe the gas didn't react because it was in a different form. Or perhaps the Ca(OH)2 wasn't in a form to capture it. Hmm, not sure yet.

Tube 3 has red-hot copper. So if there's any CO present, it would react with copper. The reaction of CO with CuO is 2CuO + CO → CO2 + Cu2O, but wait, more accurately, the reaction would be CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. So the weight gain in tube 3 would be due to CO reacting with CuO. The mass increase is 0.80 grams. Let me calculate the moles of CO that would cause that.

The reaction is: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

The molar masses: CuO is 80 g/mol, CO is 28 g/mol, Cu is 64 g/mol, CO2 is 44 g/mol. So, for every mole of CO reacting, the mass gained is (64 - 80) + (44 - 28) ? Wait, let me think. Alternatively, the mass change is the difference between the products and reactants.

Wait, let's compute the mass change per mole of CO. Let's balance the reaction:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2

Each CO reacts with CuO. So:

Molar masses:
CO: 12 + 16 = 28 g/mol
CuO: 64 + 16 = 80 g/mol
Cu: 64 g/mol
CO2: 44 g/mol

So, for each mole of CO:
- 1 mole of CuO (80 g) is consumed
- 1 mole of Cu (64 g) is produced
- 1 mole of CO2 (44 g) is produced

So the mass change is: (64 +44) - (80 +28) ?

Wait, maybe another approach. The mass of the products minus the reactants.

Wait, perhaps the mass gained is (mass of Cu + mass of CO2) minus (mass of CuO + mass of CO). Let's see:

Mass of products: 64 (Cu) + 44 (CO2) = 108 g
Mass of reactants: 80 (CuO) + 28 (CO) = 108 g
So the mass change is zero, but that contradicts the gain of 0.80g. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the copper is in a different form. Maybe it's CuO in the tube, and the CO is reducing it.

Wait, the setup is that the copper is red-hot. So perhaps the copper is in the form of CuO, and the CO is reducing it.

The reaction would be: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

So, let's see the moles involved. The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80 grams. What's the molar change here?

The moles of CO that reacted can be calculated. Let's compute the moles of CO:

Each mole of CO reacts with a mole of CuO to produce a mole of CO2 and a mole of Cu.

The mass change per mole of CO:

CuO (80g) is consumed, and we get Cu (64g) and CO2 (44g).

So for each mole of CO consumed:
- CuO is consumed: -80g
- Cu is produced: +64g
- CO2 is produced: +44g
So net: (-80 + 64 +44) = 28g. Wait, that can't be right because the mass of the products is 64 +44=108g, and the reactants are 80 +28=108g. So there's no net mass change.

Wait, that's confusing. How is there a mass gain of 0.8g?

Alternatively, perhaps only CO is reacting, and the copper is solid, so the mass gain comes from the CO2 produced. Wait, but the CO2 would escape because the tube is probably open.

Wait, maybe the copper is in the form of CuO, and it's being reduced to Cu. So the mass of the tube would increase by the amount of Cu produced.

Wait, no. Let's reevaluate the reaction: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

Let me compute the mass changes. Suppose we have x moles of CO reacting.

Each mole of CO would consume 1 mole of CuO (80g), and produce 1 mole of Cu (64g) and 1 mole of CO2 (44g). So the mass change in the tube would be (64 -80) = -16g per mole of CO, but that's a loss, which contradicts the gain. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the copper was initially in a different state. Maybe it's elemental copper, but that doesn't make sense because Cu is a metal and wouldn't react. Alternatively, perhaps the copper is in the +2 oxidation state, and CO is acting as a reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass of CO that would produce the observed gain. Let's think that each mole of CO reacting would produce some mass change.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction. Let me write it correctly.

The reaction between CO and CuO is:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

The balanced equation is correct. Now, let's calculate the moles of CO that would result in a mass change of 0.80g.

Wait, let's
