Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, but the key here is their detection limits.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with different properties, and I need to figure out which ones are visible by both instruments. Let me jot down the important details.

First, the detection limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can see up to 17 mag. HIRES, on the other hand, can go up to 16 mag. So any star with an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 mag can be seen by HIRES, and up to 17 mag by ESPRESSO. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16 mag because 16 is the stricter limit.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Oh, wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag. So any star with apparent V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and ≤16 by HIRES.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be ≤16 because that's the lower limit for both to detect. Or wait, wait, no. Wait, the way it's phrased, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". So ESPRESSO can observe V mag < 17. HIRES can observe V mag <16. So a star must have V mag <16 to be detected by both.

Wait, let me think again. Because if a star's apparent V magnitude is 16, HIRES can't see it? Or can it? Wait, the wording is: "brighter than 17 mag", so anything with V mag ≤17 can be observed. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V <=17. For HIRES, apparent V <=16.

So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have apparent V mag <=16.

Wait, no, because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it. So for a star to be seen by both, it must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, which is always true if it's also brighter than 16 for HIRES. Because 16 <17, so if a star is brighter
