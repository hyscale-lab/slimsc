Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². The problem is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, right. I remember that in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is symmetric in all directions, which means the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, actually, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers, I think.

So in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). Wait, no, wait—actually, each direction contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, and the total n is n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is (n + 3/2)ħω. Wait, I think that's right.

So the ground state is when n=0, so E = (0 + 3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be n=1, so E = (1 + 3/2)ħω = 5/2 ħω. The second excited state is n=2, E=(2 + 3/2)ħω = 7/2 ħω. The third excited state would be n=3, so E is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. So that's the first part of the question—energy is 9/2 ħω. Looking at the options, options A and C have this value. So we can consider those.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy. That's the number of ways the quantum numbers can add up to n=3. So we need the number of states where n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

Wait, each of n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. So how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) sum to 3? This is a combinatorics problem. The number of solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 where each n is ≥0. Oh right, this is a stars and bars problem. The formula is (n + k -1 choose k -1), where n is the total and k is the number of variables. So here, n=3, k=3. So (3 +3-1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

So putting it together, the energy is (9/2)ħω and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking back at the options, option A is (9/2)ħω and 10, which matches. Option C is 3 eigenfunctions, which doesn't fit. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't mix up the states. Let me think about the states again. For each n, the number of states is the number of ways to distribute n quanta among the three directions. So for n=3, the number is 4? No wait, no—each direction can have 0,1,2,3. So for n=3, the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) are:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3),
(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,0,2), (0,2,1), (0,1,2),
(1,1,1).

Counting these: 3 for the first set, 6 for the second (each permutation of 2,1,0), and 1 for the last. So 3+6+1=10. Yep, that's right. So 10 eigenfunctions. So option A is correct.


The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are determined by the total quantum number \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \), and the energy is given by \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega \). 

For the third excited state, \( n = 3 \), so the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy eigenvalue corresponds to the number of ways the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) can sum to \( n = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem solved using the stars and bars method, where the number of solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \) is:

\[
\binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state. Among the given options, only option A matches both the energy \( \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega \) and the number of eigenfunctions (10).

Answer: A
