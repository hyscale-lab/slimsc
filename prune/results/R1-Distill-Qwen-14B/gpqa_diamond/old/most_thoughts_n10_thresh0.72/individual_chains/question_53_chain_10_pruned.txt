Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, usually a strong peak around 1700-1750 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's a hint about the substituents.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down. Two aromatic-H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in various positions. But the splitting in aromatic regions can tell us about the substitution pattern. For example, para-substituted rings give two signals (each group being in equivalent positions), but ortho or meta could have more splitting. But wait, the question says two aromatic signalsâ€”so maybe it's para substitution. Because in para, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic protons are in two sets: ortho to substituent A and ortho to substituent B, but wait, no, wait. No, in para substitution, the substituents are across from each other. So the ring has symmetry, so the aromatic protons would be two sets. Hmm. Maybe each substituent is a group that doesn't split the aromatic protons into more signals. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are identical, leading to equivalent aromatic protons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two aromatic signals. So that suggests that the substituents are such that the ring has two distinct types of aromatic protons. For a para-substituted di-substituted benzene with two same substituents, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving one signal. But in this case, it's two signals. So that suggests that the substituents are different. So maybe the substituents are in the para positions but are different groups, leading to two different sets of aromatic protons. Or perhaps the substitution is in the meta positions. But meta would give more signals. Wait, for a meta substitution, if the two substituents are the same, perhaps the ring has some symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal di-substitution (like 1,2) or 1,3 (meta), but with two different substituents. Hmm, but I might need to think more about that.

Moving on, the NMR has two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to double bonds. So, perhaps there's an ester group (like R-O-CO-O-R'), but more likely, maybe an ester with a vinyl group attached. Or perhaps the substituent is an ester group that also has a double bond, like an allyl group or something. Wait, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. If R' is a vinyl group, then there would be vinyl protons. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group with a vinyl group attached, like CH2=CH-O- or something.

The two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. That suggests some coupling between the vinyl protons. A doublet could be from a CH2 group, but wait, the question says there are two signals for vinyl-H, each is a doublet and a doublet of quartets. So perhaps one vinyl group is part of an ester and another part of another group.

Wait, the ester group could have a substituent that's connected via an oxygen, like an alkoxy group with a double bond. For example, if one substituent is an ester group where the ester's R group is a vinyl group, like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 or something, but maybe the substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, the other substituent could be something else. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl ether or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and an allyl group.

Wait, the question says that the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Each substituent could be an ester group or a group that contributes to the ester functionality, but wait, no, because the FTIR indicates only one ester group. Or maybe the compound has one ester group and another substituent that is something else.

Wait, the options are all C11H12O2, etc., so the molecular formulas vary in H and maybe in the substituents.

Also, the NMR has two signals for CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. So each of those must be attached to different parts of the molecule.

Furthermore, there are no CH2 signals. That suggests that all the CH2 groups are either not present or are split into other signals. Wait, but an ester group typically has an R-O-CO-O-R' structure. For example, methyl propionate would have a CH3 from the methyl ester, and another CH3 from the propyl group. Hmm, but in that case, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is another group that brings in a methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), where R has a methyl group, and another substituent is a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methoxy group? No, because ester would be O-CO-O-R, so substituting with that would give an ester group. Alternatively, maybe the two substituents are an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3) and a methyl group attached directly.

Wait, let me try to think about the substituents. The FTIR shows an ester, so the molecule has an ester functional group. So one of the substituents is an ester group. Let's say the substituent is an ester, perhaps an alkoxy carbonyl group.

So if one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl chain, maybe. But another substituent would be something else, perhaps a vinyl group or a methyl group.

But the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals, which suggests that there are two types of vinyl protons. And two methyl groups. So perhaps the substituents are a vinyl
