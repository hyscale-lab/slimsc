Okay, so I've got this question about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2, and I need to figure it out using the given metric. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking and what the metric represents.

First off, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? It's like a sphere but with negative curvature. But wait, the term can sometimes be a bit tricky. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is also known as a tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. So the metric given here probably describes such a space.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that seems a bit unusual. I'm trying to relate it to standard metrics of pseudospheres or hyperbolic spaces. Oh, wait, the standard metric for a pseudosphere is usually written in terms of coordinates where the denominator is something like (1 + (x² + y²)/a²)² or something like that, but this is different. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's a conformally flat metric. Conformal means it's like a scaling of the Euclidean metric. So ds² is a multiple of (dx² + dy²), which suggests it's in 2D conformal coordinates. The scaling factor here is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). So the line element is determined by this function.

Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, wait, what's the radius of a pseudosphere? I think the radius in hyperbolic geometry is related to the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a pseudosphere is negative, and K = -1/(r²), where r is the radius of curvature. So if r=2, then K = -1/(4). Hmm, but does that tie into the given metric?

Let me check the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So if I let 4 = (2)^2, then perhaps the radius of the pseudosphere here is 2. Because when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, which would mean the metric blows up—so that's likely the edge of the pseudosphere. So the domain of x² + y² < 4 is the region we're considering.

Wait, but how does this relate to the area? For a pseudosphere, I recall that the total Gaussian curvature is related to the Euler characteristic via Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a compact surface says that the integral of Gaussian curvature over the surface equals 2π times the Euler characteristic. But wait, a pseudosphere is not compact because it's infinitely long, right? So its Euler characteristic is zero? Or maybe it's a different case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the metric more directly. The area element in 2D is given by the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal (only dx² and dy² terms and no cross terms), the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. So the area element dA would be sqrt(-det g) dx dy. Wait, actually, no. Wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2}) dx dy. Since the metric is conformally flat, g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_{xy}=0. So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So the area would be the integral of that over the entire domain. The domain is where the denominator is positive, so x² + y² < 4. So the integral is over the disk of radius 2.

So the area A is ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy over x² + y² < 4.

Wait, but that integral might not converge. Let me think: as (x² + y²) approaches 4 from below, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the integral might diverge to infinity, meaning the area is infinite. But that can't be right, because a pseudosphere has finite area. Or does it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: a pseudosphere, or tractricoid, is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its intrinsic geometry is hyperbolic, and the total area is finite. Wait, but wait—no, wait. Actually, the tractricoid is a finite area surface. So if the metric given here is that of a pseudosphere, the area should be finite.

Wait, but the area as computed by that integral might be infinite. Let me do the integral step by step.

Switching to polar coordinates makes sense because the integrand is radially symmetric. Let me let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r². So the area A is the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to θ=2π of [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So factor out the 32 and the r, and integrate over θ and r.

First, the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Now, compute the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫ du/u evaluated from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) [ln |u|] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but when u=0, the denominator is zero, which would be a problem. Wait, no, wait: when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So the integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr is from u=4 (when r=0) to u=0 (when r=2).

So substituting, the integral is ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [ (r dr) / u ].

Wait, but r dr is - (du)/2, because du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ ( du / u ) from 4 to 0.

The integral of 1/u du is ln |u| + C.

So evaluating from 4 to 0: [ (-1/2) ( ln 0 - ln 4 ) ]

Wait, but ln 0 is negative infinity. So ln 0 minus ln4 is negative infinity minus a finite number, which is negative infinity. So the integral becomes (-1/2) * (-infinity) = positive infinity.

So the entire area A is 32 * 2π * [ integral which is infinity ] → infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right because a pseudosphere has finite area. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric isn't representing the entire pseudosphere. Maybe the given metric is only a portion of it or perhaps it's
