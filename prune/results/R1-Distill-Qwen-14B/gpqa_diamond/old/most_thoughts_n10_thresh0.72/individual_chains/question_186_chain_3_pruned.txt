Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on this reaction, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene means it's a norbornene structure. The numbering is 2-azabicyclo, so the nitrogen is at position 2. The substituents are a vinyl group at position 2 as well. So, the structure has a bridged bicyclic system with a double bond and a vinyl group attached to the same carbon as the nitrogen.

Wait, the structure might look like this: the bicyclo system has two bridgehead carbons at positions 1 and 4. The nitrogen is at position 2, which is connected to a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but actually, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so attached to the nitrogen at C2).

The reaction in question is the Cope rearrangement. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes to form another 1,5-diene. But wait, wait, no, I think the Cope is specifically for 1,5-dienes to rearrange to another structure, maybe with different substituents.

But wait, another possibility: the Cope rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction that occurs in 1,5-dienes. It's a [3,3] shift. The structure should have two conjugated double bonds, but perhaps in a ring system?

Wait, the compound here is a bicyclic molecule with a double bond. Let me think about the structure again. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene suggests that the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 (if I'm numbering correctly). But the substituents are at position 2: a vinyl group and an amino group (but wait, it's 2-azabicyclo, so the nitrogen is part of the ring).

Wait
