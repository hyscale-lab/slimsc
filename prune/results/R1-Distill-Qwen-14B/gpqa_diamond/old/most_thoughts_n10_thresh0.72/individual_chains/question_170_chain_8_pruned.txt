Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, and we have to pick the correct one. 

Hmm, okay. I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula: <A> = ψ† A ψ, where ψ is the state vector, and A is the operator corresponding to the observable. So in this case, the observable is S_y, which is the spin in the y-direction.

Wait, but wait a second. Spin is a type of angular momentum, right? And for electrons, the spin operators are given in terms of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, the spin operator S for each direction is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix. 

So for the y-direction, the spin operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times σ_y. The σ_y matrix is given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. 

The state vector ψ is given as (3i, 4). Let me note that down. So ψ = [3i, 4]^T. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically column vectors, so I need to treat them as such.

Wait, but to calculate the expectation value, I think I can proceed as follows:

The expectation value <S_y> is equal to ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.

So first, let's write out ψ as a column vector. ψ is (3i, 4), so as a column it's:

[ 3i ]
[ 4  ]

The conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ (3i)* , 4* ] which, since 3i is 3i, its conjugate is -3i, and 4 is real, so 4 conjugate is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y, so let's write that out:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i],
                [i, 0] ]

So now, to compute <S_y> = ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The expectation value is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. So let's compute this step by step.

First, let's compute S_y ψ. So we'll multiply the matrix S_y with ψ.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the order is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. So perhaps it's easier to compute S_y ψ first, then multiply by ψ†.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each part step by step.

Let me write out S_y ψ:

S_y is a 2x2 matrix, and ψ is a 2
