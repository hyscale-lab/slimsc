Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their magnetic moments influenced by magnetic fields. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, which makes sense because Sz is the spin in the z-direction.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin would align with this field. But when the field is turned off and a new field is applied along +Y, the situation changes. I think I need to figure out how the spin state evolves when the field direction changes.

Wait, when the field is suddenly turned off and then another is turned on, the spin state doesn't change instantaneously, right? So the system will be in a state that's no longer the eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So it'll start precessing.

The magnetic moment's oscillation relates to the energy levels and the transition between them. The energy levels for a spin in a magnetic field are given by E = -mu·B. Since mu is proportional to Sz, the energy levels would be E = -gamma Sz B for the initial state when the field was along Z.

But when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian should be proportional to S_y, because the field is along Y now. So the new energy levels depend on S_y instead of S_z.

Wait, the original state was an eigenstate of S_z. Let me think about the basis. Let's say the initial state was |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2 (since spin-1/2). After the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the new eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, which are linear combinations of the original |+z> and |-z> states.

When the system is in a state that's not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, it will start oscillating between the states, leading to oscillations in expectation values like <Sz>.

The oscillation frequency comes from the energy difference between the new eigenstates. The energy levels when the field is along Y would be E = -gamma B S_y. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ±(ħ/2), so the energies would be E_+ = -(gamma B)(ħ/2) and E_- = (gamma B)(ħ/2). Wait, no, wait: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. Oh wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, the Hamiltonian H is given by H = -mu·B. So for the field along Y, H would be proportional to S_y. Let me express this correctly. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z initially. But when the field is in Y, the magnetic moment's component along Y is gamma S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, no, maybe I should be
