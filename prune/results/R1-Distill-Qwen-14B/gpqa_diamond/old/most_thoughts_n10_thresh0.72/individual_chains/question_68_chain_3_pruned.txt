Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. Let me break it down.

So initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment mu is aligned with it. The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S_z. Since the field is along Z, I guess the spin is also aligned along Z, so the spin state is either up or down along Z. But in any case, when the field is suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. Then, the average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. I need to find the oscillation frequency.

Wait, so the magnetic field was initially along Z, then switched to Y. Both have the same magnitude B. So the system's Hamiltonian must change. Initially, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian would be H_initial = - mu · B, which in terms of spin operators is probably something with S_z. But after the field is turned off, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = - mu · B along Y, so H_final = - gamma B S_y maybe? Or wait, no. Wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is gamma times the spin component. So mu = gamma S. So the magnetic moment in the B field would have an energy proportional to the dot product of mu and B. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. So when B is along Z, H_initial = - gamma B S_z. When it's turned off, and then B is along Y, H_final = - gamma B S_y.

But wait, the problem says the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on. So the change happens abruptly. So the state of the system just after the change is the same as before, but the Hamiltonian changes. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, but the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the system will start evolving under H_final, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

So the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment, <mu_z>. Since mu_z is gamma times S_z, the oscillation in <mu_z> will depend on the time evolution under H_final.

Hmm, how do I find the
