Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about stellar abundances. Let me read it carefully and figure it out step by step. 

The question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think the masses directly affect the abundance ratios since we're only dealing with photospheric compositions. 

The given data includes some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex. 

The solar photosphere has given values: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think about how to parse that. 

I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, I think it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

But wait, the question gives the photospheric composition for the Sun as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Hmm. Wait, that's a bit odd. Let me think. So 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), which is about 3.16e-5. Wait, that's a number, but perhaps it's more useful to keep it in log terms.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. But wait, [Fe/H] is usually defined as the
