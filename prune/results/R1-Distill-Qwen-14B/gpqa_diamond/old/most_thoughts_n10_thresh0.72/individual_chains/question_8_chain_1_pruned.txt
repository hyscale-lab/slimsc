Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this genetics problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question is about a high-throughput experiment in white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The results of testing these mutants against the pathogen are given, and I need to figure out the interaction between these genes.

The data provided:
- g1 resistance: 75% of control
- g2 resistance: 0%
- g3 resistance: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The options are A to D, each making different claims about which gene is a transcription factor, whether there's pleiotropy or redundancy, and the epistatic relationships.

I remember that in genetics, when you have epistatic relationships, the interaction between genes affects the phenotype. If a double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it suggests that the two genes are acting in parallel pathways (or redundant), and their combined loss leads to a worse outcome. Alternatively, if the double mutant isn't worse, maybe they're in the same pathway.

Also, the question mentions that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor upstream of others. So one gene is likely regulating others. Let's think about how gene function relates to the mutant resistance.

The control has 100% resistance. The more the percentage, the more resistant the plant is. So lower percentages mean the plant is more susceptible to infection.

Looking at the data:

g2 has 0% resistance. That's very susceptible. So knocking out G2 completely abolishes resistance. That suggests G2 is very important. Maybe it's like a master regulator here. The fact that g2 is so affected could mean it's a transcription factor upstream of others because without it, none of the downstream genes are expressed, so the plant can't resist the disease.

g1 has 75%, which is a 25% loss. So it's less susceptible than wild-type but not as bad as g2 or others.

g3 has 50% resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance by half.

Now the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. Both mutants have issues, and the double is as bad as g2 alone. Hmm, since g2 alone is 0%, which is the most susceptible, perhaps G2 is epistatic over G1. Because when both are knocked out, the effect is the same as when G2 is knocked out. That suggests that the pathway is blocked at G2's level; knocking out G1 doesn't make it worse than G2 knockout.

Wait, but g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So the double mutant isn't worse than g2. So maybe G2 is epistatic towards G1. Because in epistasis, the downstream gene is epistatic. So if G2 is acting after G1, then the phenotype of g2 would mask the effect of g1. For example, if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1, then without G2, G1 can't function anyway. So the double mutant would look like G2 knockout.

Similarly, looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. That's much worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining g1 and g3 makes things much worse. So the two genes might be acting in parallel pathways. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance plummets more than either alone. So when you have redundancy, knocking out both would have a bigger effect. Or perhaps they're in the same pathway, but with additive effects.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the epistatic relationships. If two genes are in the same pathway, then the double mutant might not show an additive effect. But if they are in parallel pathways (like redundancy), then the double mutant would be worse than either single.

In this case, g1g3 is 10%, way worse than either, so they might be in parallel pathways or redundant.

Looking at the other double mutants: g2g3 is 0%, same as
