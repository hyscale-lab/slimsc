Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star's photosphere and the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The key point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor would be (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots). That's the factor they are asking for.

The transition between the two levels is at about 1448 Å. I remember that this wavelength falls in the near-ultraviolet range. Since the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, I can use the Boltzmann equation for population ratios.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
n2 is the number of atoms in level 2,
n1 in level 1,
g2 and g1 are the statistical weights,
E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
k is Boltzmann's constant,
T is the temperature.

But since the problem talks about the ratio when the star has spots, and when it doesn't, I think we can ignore the statistical weights if they're the same in both cases, which I think they are. So, the ratio simplifies to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ) for the two cases.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The transition wavelength is given, so I can find the energy difference between the two levels. The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. So, the energy difference (E2 - E1) is equal to the photon energy from that transition.

Let me compute that. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. So, E = hc/λ.

But I need to find (E2-E1)/(k*T) for both temperatures, because the ratio depends on the temperature.

Wait, no. The ratio is (n2/n1) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ). So, the ratio changes with temperature. If the temperature T decreases, this exponent becomes more positive, so the ratio decreases. So when T goes down, the ratio n2/n1 goes down. Which aligns with the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases.

So, without spots, T is 6000 K, with spots, 5500 K. So, we can compute the ratio without spots, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), and with spots, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). We need to find R1/R2.

Wait, no. Because when T is higher, the exponent becomes more negative, leading to a lower ratio. Wait, let me think:

Wait, the exponent is negative (because E2 is higher than E1 when the transition is from level 1 to 2 (emission?), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the transition corresponds to a photon of that wavelength, which would be emitted when an atom drops from level 2 to level 1. So, E2 must be higher than E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive.

So, the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. That is, higher T leads to lower n2/n1 ratio. Wait, no, because it's exp(-x). So, as x increases (because T increases), exp(-x) decreases. So for higher T, the ratio n2/n1 decreases.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the overall T is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So, in the spotless case, n2/n1 is higher than in the spotted case. Which is what the problem says: the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that's correct.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2, where R1 is when T is 6000 K, R2 is when T is 5500 K.

So, factor = R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, no: let me compute it correctly.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ΔE/(k T2) ] ) )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, no: no, because R1 = exp( a ), R2 = exp(b), so R1/R2 = exp( a - b )

Wait, a = -ΔE/(k T1 )

b = -ΔE/(k T2 )

So a - b = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Wait, that's the same as ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute the exponent as (ΔE/k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ].

Wait, let's compute the exponent:

(ΔE/k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ]

We can compute ΔE first.

ΔE = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s). λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) ) J.

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) ) * 10^(-25 +7) = approx 1.373 * 10^-18 J.

Then, k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, (ΔE )/k = (1.373e-18 ) / (1.38e-23 ) = (1.373 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99,500 K.

So, (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

Wait, that's a big number. Hmm.

So now, the exponent is (ΔE/k) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166666, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

So, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (0.000166666 - 0.000181818 ) = -0.000015152.

So, the exponent is 99500 K * (-0.000015152) ≈ -1.508 K.

Wait, that's approximately -1.508.

So, the factor is exp( -1.508 ) ≈ e^(-1.508) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but wait, I thought the factor was R1/R2. So, R1 is the ratio when T is 6000 K, R2 when T is 5500 K. So, R1/R2 is exp( exponent ), which is exp(-1.508) ≈ 0.221. So, the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. Wait, that can't be right because the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots). But according to this, R1/R2 is 0.221, which is less than 1. So that would imply R1 is smaller than R2, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, that can't be right. So, perhaps I messed up the exponent.

Wait, let me recompute. Let's go back to the Boltzmann equation.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But E2 - E1 is positive, so the exponent is negative. So, as T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases.

So, when T is higher (6000 K), n2/n1 is smaller. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So, ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive.

At higher T, the thermal energy is higher, so more atoms can be in the higher energy state. So, n2 would be higher when T is higher. So, n2/n1 would be higher when T is higher. So, when T increases, the ratio increases.

Wait, so if T increases, the exponent -(ΔE)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(-x) increases as x becomes less negative. So, yes, higher T leads to higher n2/n1.

So, in our case, when the star has no spots, T is 6000 K. So, n2/n1 is higher than when T is 5500 K (spots). So, R1 (no spots) = n2/n1 at T1=6000 K.

R2 (spots) = n2/n1 at T2=5500 K.

So, R1/R2 is the ratio of the two.

So, R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no, let's make it explicit:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no:

Wait, [a - b] = [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

So, that makes sense.

So, with T1=6000, T2=5500.

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500) - (1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) )= 500 / (33,000,000) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = about +1.515e-5.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) which we calculated as about 99,500 K.

So, (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 99,500 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99,500 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.508.

So, the exponent is +1.508.

So, R1/R2 = exp(1.508) ≈ e^1.508.

What's e^1.508? Let's calculate.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

Wait, let me get a more precise value.

Hmm, 1.508 is about 1.508. Let's compute e^1.508.

We can think of e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.008 is approximately 1 + 0.008 + (0.008)^2/2 + ... ≈ 1.008032.

So, e^1.508 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.008 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.008032 ≈ 4.516.

Wait, but wait, 1.508 is 1.5 + 0.008. So, yeah, that's correct.

So, R1/R2 ≈ e^1.508 ≈ 4.516.

Wait, that would mean that the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times larger than when it has spots. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, another way to compute the exponent:

(ΔE/k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = (99500 K) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^{-1}.

Let me compute 1/5500 and 1/6000:

1/5500 = approx 0.000181818.

1/6000 = approx 0.0001666667.

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.0001666667 = 0.000015151.

Multiply by 99500: 99500 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.507.

So, exponent is 1.507, so e^1.507 ≈ 4.51.

So, yes, the factor is about 4.5, so option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since the statistical weights \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are constant, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\)) by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio of the populations at two temperatures \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (spotless) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spotted) is given by:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 99,500 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, compute the term \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,500 \times 0.000015151 = 1.508.
\]

Finally, the factor is:

\[
\exp(1.508) \approx 4.51.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. Therefore, the correct answer is:
