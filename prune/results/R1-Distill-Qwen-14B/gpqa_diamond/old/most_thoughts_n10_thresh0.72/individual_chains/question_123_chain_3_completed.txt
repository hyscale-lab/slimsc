Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's pretty fast, like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh right, because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that.

The problem is asking, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we're looking at time dilation here because the two frames are moving relative to each other at a significant speed.

Wait, the key here is the time experienced in each frame. Let me think about the relationship between proper time and dilated time. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event, but in this case, the events (the time passing) are happening in the ejecta's frame. So the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (which is moving relative to the ejecta) would be different.

Let me jot down the variables. The speed v is 60,000 km/s. Time in ejecta frame, t', is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance in Galaxy's frame, which is x. But wait, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards them at v, right? Because if from the ejecta's frame the Galaxy is moving towards it at v, then from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves towards them at the same speed v. Because in special relativity, velocities just add, but since both are inertial frames, the speed is the same as observed from each other's frames.

So, the position x in the Galaxy frame would be x = v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. But wait, the time we have is t' = 50 seconds, which is the proper time in the ejecta frame. So we need to find t in terms of t' using the time dilation formula.

Time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). But wait, wait. Wait, no, because in this case, the time t is the dilated time in the Galaxy frame. Because the event (the passage of time) is happening in the ejecta's frame. So the proper time is t', and the dilated time is t = gamma * t'.

Wait, no, I think I might mix it up. Let me think again. Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the time interval) occur at the same place. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is t', and the events are happening at the same location in that frame. So for the Galaxy, which is moving relative to the ejecta, the time t would be longer than t'. So yes, t = gamma * t'.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute v first. v is 60,000 km/s, so v = 6e4 km/s. The speed of light c is 3e5 km/s. So v = (6e4)/(3e5) = 0.2 c. So v/c = 0.2.

Calculating gamma: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.81) is 0.9, sqrt(0.96) is a bit higher. Let me calculate 0.96^(1/2). So 0.96 = 96/100. Square root of 96 is about 9.798, so 9.798/10 = 0.9798. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. Wait, wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach.

Wait, another way to compute gamma: 1/sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1/0.96) = sqrt(1.041666...). The square root of 1.041666... is approximately 1.0206, yes. So gamma ≈ 1.0206.

Then t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame is about 51.03 seconds. Then, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is x = v * t. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them at velocity v, so distance is speed multiplied by time.

v is 60,000 km/s, and t is 51.03 s. So x = 60,000 * 51.03. Let me compute that.

60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check: v = 60,000 km/s, t ≈51.03 s.

So x = 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 * 51.03. Let me compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. Then 60,000 *0.03 = 1,800. So 3,060,000 +1,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close but not exactly the same as my calculation. Hmm. So did I make a mistake in calculating gamma?

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation error in gamma. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. Let me compute 0.96 as 96/100. So sqrt(96) is approximately 9.798, but perhaps more accurately, I can compute it.

Wait, 9.8^2 = 96.04. So 9.8^2 = 96.04, which is 0.04 more than 96. So sqrt(96) is approximately 9.798, as I thought earlier. So 9.798/10 = 0.9798.

So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. So gamma is 1.0206.

Wait, but perhaps using more precise calculation for gamma. Let me compute 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - 0.2^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) = 0.9798, as before. So 1/sqrt(0.96) is about 1.0206. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute gamma using more precise numbers. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute gamma as 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)).

So let me compute (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.97980, so 1/0.97980 is approximately 1.0206.

So t = 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 s.

So the distance is 60,000 km/s *51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Looking back at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

So option D is 3,060,000 km. My calculation is 3,061,800. Hmm, that's a bit off. But perhaps the question expects us to not use the exact gamma and perhaps use a simpler approximation.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should think about length contraction instead of time dilation. Because the distance in the Galaxy's frame is the proper length. Let me think again.

Wait, proper length is the length measured in the frame where the two events occur at rest relative to each other. Hmm, but in this case, the distance the ejecta travels is in the direction of motion. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about using the Lorentz transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects and expects a classical approach. But the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, so relativistic effects are significant. So I think we need to consider time dilation.

Wait, let me re-express the problem. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v=60,000 km/s. The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is t' =50 s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the time t is longer due to time dilation. So t = gamma * t'.

But then, the distance is x = v * t, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them at speed v, so the distance the ejecta covers is v multiplied by t.

Hmm, in that case, the calculation is correct. So perhaps the options have rounded gamma to a certain number of decimal places.

Wait, perhaps gamma is calculated more precisely. Let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 0.96 to the power of 0.5. Let's compute it. 0.96 is 96/100.

So let's compute sqrt(96) accurately. 9.798^2 = 96.04, as I thought earlier. So sqrt(96) is approximately 9.798. So 9.798 /10 = 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 ≈1.0206.

So t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈51.03 s.

x = 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000*(50 +1.03) = 3,000,000 + 60,000 *1.03.

60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km.

So the calculated distance is about 3,061,800 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the question expects us to take gamma as approximately 1.02, which would give t=50 *1.02=51 s. Then, x=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is option D.

So the correct answer would be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy, considering relativistic effects. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, and the relative velocity between them is \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)). The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \), and we need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

### Step 1: Time Dilation
In special relativity, the time dilation formula relates the proper time \( t' \) (measured in the ejecta's frame) to the dilated time \( t \) (measured in the Galaxy's frame):
\[
t = \gamma t',
\]
where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]
Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206.
\]
Thus:
\[
t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame
In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), and the time elapsed is \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \). The distance traveled is:
\[
x = v \cdot t.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
x = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with the Options
The calculated distance is approximately \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \). Among the given options:
- **A)** \( 2,940,000 \, \text{km} \): Too low.
- **B)** \( 3,000,000 \, \text{km} \): Close but slightly low.
- **C)** \( 2,880,000 \, \text{km} \): Too low.
- **D)** \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \): Closest to the calculated value.

The slight discrepancy likely arises from rounding \( \gamma \) to fewer decimal places in the problem setup. Using \( \gamma \approx 1.02 \) instead of \( 1.0206 \) gives \( t = 51 \, \text{s} \), leading to \( x = 60,000 \times 51 = 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which matches option D.

### Final Answer
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

Answer: D
