Okay, so I have this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3).

They know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of another gene. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes. The question is about the interaction between these genes based on the resistance levels observed when these mutants are infected with the pathogen.

The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild type). The control has 100% resistance, which probably means it's highly resistant. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility—so lower resistance. 

The data from the tests:
- g1: 75% → So, 75% of the control’s resistance. That means the mutant is more susceptible than wild type but not as bad as others.
- g2: 0% → So, these plants are completely susceptible; no resistance at all.
- g3: 50% → So, half as resistant as the wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → Pretty susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% → Like g2 alone, no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → Same as g2 alone.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out the gene interactions based on this. The options give different scenarios about which is a transcription factor, whether there's pleiotropy, redundancy, and which is epistatic to whom.

First, I should recall what each term means:

1. Transcription factor: a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. So, if a gene is a TF, its mutation would disrupt the regulation of other genes.

2. Pleiotropy: when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here, but maybe if mutations in different genes lead to similar phenotypes.

3. Gene redundancy: when two or more genes can perform the same function, so knocking out both might have a more severe effect than each alone.

4. Epistasis: when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutation depends on the presence of a functional gene A. So, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as gene A's single mutant, gene A is epistatic to gene B.

Wait, so in terms of resistance, if a plant's resistance is determined by a pathway where gene A is upstream of gene B, then knocking out A would prevent B from being expressed (if A is a TF for B). So, the resistance would depend on both.

Looking at the data:

Let me list the single mutants:

g1 → 75% resistance. So, less than wild type but not as bad as g2 or some doubles.

g2 → 0% → So, the most severe. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor because if it's upstream, then other genes downstream wouldn't be expressed, leading to more susceptibility.

g3 →50% → Not as bad as g2, so maybe G3 is downstream of another gene.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → Same as g2. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only g2 is knocked out. So, perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1, because even when you knock out both, the resistance doesn't get worse beyond what G2 alone does. Wait, wait, but epistasis usually is about the order in a pathway. So, if G2 is upstream of G1, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 from working, so the double mutant would look like the G2 mutant. Which is what we see here.

Wait, but looking at another double mutant: g1g3 is 10%. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than when either is knocked out alone. G1 alone gives 75% (which is more than g3's 50% and g1g3's 10%).

Wait, so when G1 is alone
