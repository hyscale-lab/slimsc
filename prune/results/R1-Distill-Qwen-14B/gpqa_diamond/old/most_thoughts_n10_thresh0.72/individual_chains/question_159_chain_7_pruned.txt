Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar's spectrum and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical range. Before that peak, at shorter wavelengths, the flux drops a lot. I remember that in quasars, there's something called the Lyman-alpha forest, which is a series of absorption lines blueward (shorter wavelength) of the Lyman-alpha emission line. But wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm, right? So if the peak is at 790 nm, that's much longer than 121 nm. Wait, but wait, the Lyman-alpha forest is usually seen in the optical or near-infrared of the observed spectrum if the quasar is at a high redshift.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is emitted at 121 nm. If the observed wavelength is longer, that's due to redshift. So the peak at 790 nm must be the redshifted Lyman-alpha line. So the redshift z would be (790 nm / 121 nm) minus 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So, z ≈ 5.528. Wait, because (observed wavelength = emitted * (1+z)), so yes, 790 = 121*(1+z) → 1+z ≈ 790/121 ≈ 6.528 → z ≈5.528.

But wait, wait! Wait a second. Oh no, no, wait. Wait, the Lyman-alpha forest is at wavelengths shorter than the Lyman-alpha emission line. So if the quasar's own Lyman-alpha is at 121 nm, when it's redshifted, all the absorption lines (from intervening hydrogen) would show up at wavelengths shorter than the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission line in the observed spectrum. So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is much longer than 121 nm, that must be the Lyman-alpha emission line. So that tells me that the quasar's Lyman-alpha is at 790 nm observed. So z = (790 / 121) - 1 ≈ 6.528 -1 = 5.528. So z is about 5.5.

Wait, but wait again. No, wait, I think I got that backwards. The Lyman-alpha emission line is at 121 nm when the quasar emits it. If the quasar is at a high redshift, this line would be redshifted into the optical. So the observed wavelength is 121 nm * (1 + z). So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then
