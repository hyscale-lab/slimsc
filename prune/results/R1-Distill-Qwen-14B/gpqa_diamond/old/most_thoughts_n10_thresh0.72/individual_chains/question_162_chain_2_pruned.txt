Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, metric in terms of 2D coordinates x and y. So this is probably a 2-dimensional spacetime or a surface embedded in higher dimensions. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a surface with constant negative curvature, right?

Wait, pseudosphere radius—so the Gaussian curvature is related. I remember that for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature K is negative and proportional to 1/(r²), where r is the radius. But wait, pseudosphere is a term sometimes used for tractricoid, which has constant negative curvature. So the metric here must be related to a space with negative curvature.

Looking at the metric, it's similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space, which is usually written in isothermal coordinates. The general form for the hyperbolic metric is ds² = (4/(1 + (x² + y²)/a²))² (dx² + dy²), where a is related to the curvature. Wait, but here it's (32)/(4 - x² - y²). Oh, wait, maybe I should think in terms of Poincaré disk model.

The Poincaré disk model has a metric ds² = (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² +
