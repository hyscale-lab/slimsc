Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. So the coefficients aren't probabilities yet; I need to find the probabilities after normalization.

Wait, the first part of the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So, what does this matrix look like?

Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because |up> and |down> are the eigenstates, so probably two states), the matrix A would be:
[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Wait, because for i≠j, A_ij = hbar/2, otherwise zero. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So this looks familiar—it's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], so when multiplied by hbar/2, it becomes this A matrix.

But wait, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because measuring in the X basis would involve projecting the state |alpha> onto these eigenstates.

So the operator in question has these as eigenstates. So to find the probabilities, I think I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates of operator A.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |–x>, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X. So, if I express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |–x>, the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

Wait, but before that, I need to normalize |alpha>.

Let me write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes
