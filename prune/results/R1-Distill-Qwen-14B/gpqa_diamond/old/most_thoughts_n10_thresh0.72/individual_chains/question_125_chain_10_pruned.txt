Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to think through it. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = ½ m ω² r². Oh right, I remember that this is similar to the 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which is a standard problem.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. I need to find which option is correct. 

Wait, let me break this down. First, I should recall how the energy levels work for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is spherically symmetric, so the energy depends on the total quantum number, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each dimension. In 3D, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. But wait, n is actually the sum plus 3, or is it n_x + n_y + n_z? Let me think: no, the formula is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the principal quantum number. Alternatively, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n, which in 3D would be n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. 

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight. For each direction (x, y, z), the energy levels are E_x = (n_x + ½) ħω, similarly for E_y and E_z. So the total energy is E = E_x + E_y + E_z = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So yes, the total energy depends on the sum N = n_x + n_y + n_z, which is the same as the principal quantum number minus some factors. 

Wait, no, more accurately, the principal quantum number is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (
