Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is about. 

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we dilute with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid like acetic acid, its concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Then, during titration with a strong base like NaOH, the pH will rise as the acid is neutralized.

Wait, let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. **Calculate the initial concentration after dilution.**
   Acetic acid is initially 0.05 M in 20 cm³. When we add another 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles. So the new concentration should be half, right? Because concentration is moles over volume, and the volume doubles, so concentration halves.

   So initial concentration after dilution (C1) is 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M.

2. **Determine the equivalence point.**
   At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. 

   Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.0005 moles.

   The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) is 1:1. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.0005 mol.

   The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume (V) = moles / concentration = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5.00 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

3. **Find the pH at 25% titration.**
   25% of the equivalence volume means 25% of 5 cm³ is 1.25 cm³ of NaOH added.

   So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M × 0.00125 L = 0.000125 mol.

   Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.000125 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.000125 mol of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).

   Let me calculate the concentrations after this neutralization.

   The total volume at this point is initial solution (40 cm³) + 1.25 cm³ = 41.25 cm³ = 0.04125 L.

   Remaining acetic acid: initial 0.0005 mol - 0.000125 mol = 0.000375 mol.

   Acetate formed: 0.000125 mol.

   So concentrations:
   [CH3COOH] = 0.000375 / 0.04125 ≈ 0.00909 M.
   [CH3COO^-] = 0.000125 / 0.04125 ≈ 0.00303 M.

   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

   The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa ≈ 4.74 (since 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is about 0.26, so 4.74).

   Plugging in the values:
   pH = 4.74 + log(0.00303 / 0.00909) 
   Let me compute that ratio: 0.00303 / 0.00909 ≈ 0.333. Log of 0.333 is approximately -0.477.

   So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. That's about 4.26. Hmm, so option A says 4.26, option D says 4.57... so maybe the pH is around 4.26 here.

4. **Calculate the pH at equivalence point.**
   At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. This will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.

   The concentration of acetate: moles is 0.0005 mol (same as initial acid), and the total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 5 cm³ (equivalence NaOH) = 45 cm³ = 0.045 L.

   So [CH3COO^-] = 0.0005 / 0.045 ≈ 0.01111 M.

   The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

   The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

   Using the approximation for weak bases:
   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.01111) = x² / 0.01111.

   Let's set x² = Kb * 0.01111 => x² = (5.405e-10)(0.01111) = approximately 5.999e-12.

   Taking sqrt: x ≈ 7.746e-6. So [OH^-] ≈ 7.746e-6.

   pOH = -log(7.746e-6) ≈ 5.11. So pH = 14 - 5.11 = 8.89.

   Wait, but none of the options have 8.89. Let me check the options again.

   Option A: 4.26; 8.52. Hmm, close. Option D: 4.57;6.92. No.

   Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the Kb.

   Wait, Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

   So, for the acetate ion concentration, 0.0005 mol / 0.045 L is 0.01111 M. So calculation should be correct.

   Wait, what's the exact value of x?

   x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.01111 = let me compute that: 5.405e-10 * 0.01111 = 5.405e-10 * 1.111e-2 = 5.405 * 1.111e-12 ≈ 5.999e-12. So x is sqrt(5.999e-12) = ~7.746e-6.

   So [OH^-] is about 7.746e-6, so pOH is about 5.108, so pH is 14-5.108=8.892, which is about 8.89. But none of the options have this.

   Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume calculation. Let me check. 

   Initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Then at equivalence, we added 5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 45 cm³, which is correct.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte and completely dissociates. So [CH3COO^-] is exactly 0.0005 / 0.045 = 0.01111 M. That part's correct.

   Hmm, but none of the options for equivalence point are near 8.89. Looking back at the options:

   Option A: 4.26;8.52.

   Option D:4.57;6.92.

   Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at equivalence point.

   Another approach: perhaps using the exact formula instead of the approximation.

   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

   Let me set up the equation.

   Let x be the concentration of OH^-.

   Then, [CH3COOH] = x.

   [CH3COO^-] = 0.01111 - x ≈ 0.01111 (since x is very small).

   So Kb = x² / 0.01111 = 5.405e-10.

   So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.01111 = 5.999e-12.

   x = sqrt(5.999e-12) = ~7.746e-6, same as before.

   So the same result. So pH would be approximately 8.89, but none of the options match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

   Alternatively, perhaps the initial dilution calculation is wrong. Let me double-check that.

   Initial acetic acid: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. 

   After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. That's correct.

   So I think the equivalence point pH
