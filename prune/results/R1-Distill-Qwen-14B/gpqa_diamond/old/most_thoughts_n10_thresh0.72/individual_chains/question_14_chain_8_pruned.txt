Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and fixed samples. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question involves a ChIP-seq experiment done on PFA-fixed human B cells using an antibody for the IKAROS transcription factor. After sequencing, they found peaks, but when they switched to PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. I need to figure out where these peaks are most likely located.

First, what do I know about ChIP-seq and the fixation methods? ChIP-seq is used to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. Fixation is important because it cross-links proteins to DNA, preserving their binding locations so they can be isolated and sequenced.

PFA is paraformaldehyde. I remember that PFA is a common crosslinker used in ChIP experiments. It's usually used at a low concentration, maybe around 1%, to fix cells quickly. PFA crosslinks proteins to DNA, but maybe not as efficiently as other methods in some cases. DSG is a different crosslinker, 1,4-dithiosemicarbazide. I think DSG is a stronger crosslinker that can form more stable bonds, especially between proteins that are close together but not directly bound. Oh wait, I also recall that PFA might not crosslink as efficiently in certain regions or under some conditions, leading to lower yields in some areas.

Wait, but the question is about when they used PFA+DSG versus just PFA. So the first experiment used PFA alone, and the second used both. The peaks disappeared when PFA+DSG was used. That suggests that the PFA alone wasn't sufficient to crosslink the IKAROS transcription factor to DNA in certain regions, but when DSG was added, those regions didn't show peaks anymore. Or perhaps the oppositeâ€”maybe the PFA+DSG caused some issues.

Alternatively, could it be that the initial peaks detected with PFA were false positives or due to some shearing issues? No, I'm not sure. Let me think about the crosslinking efficiency. PFA might not crosslink as effectively in regions where the chromatin structure is more open or in regions that are less accessible. Or maybe in regions where the protein binding is weaker.

Wait, another angle. I remember that some proteins are more efficiently crosslinked with PFA than others. Also, maybe the regions where the transcription factor binds are more
