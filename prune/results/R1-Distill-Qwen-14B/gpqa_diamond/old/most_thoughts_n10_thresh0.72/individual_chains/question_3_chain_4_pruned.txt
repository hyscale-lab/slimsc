Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what the question is about. 

Alright, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state given by 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. We're asked to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are A to D, some decimal numbers.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So for this problem, we'll need to calculate the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them according to the operator.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation value individually and then sum them weighted by 10 and 5 respectively.

First, let's write down the state ψ. It's given as (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check if this is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The square of 0.5 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which adds up to 1. So, yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix, whose eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So the expectation value of σz is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times 1, plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times (-1).

Wait, wait. The state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the amplitude for |↑⟩ is 0.5, which is 1/2, so the probability is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 or 0.25. The amplitude for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 or 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the σx expectation is a bit trickier. Because σx is the Pauli x matrix, which doesn't share the same eigenstates as σz. The eigenstates of σx are |+⟩ and |-⟩, which are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), but maybe it's easier to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express σx in terms of its
