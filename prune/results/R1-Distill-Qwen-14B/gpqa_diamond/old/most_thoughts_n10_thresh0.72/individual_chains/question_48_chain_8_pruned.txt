Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that cyclohexanone undergoes a series of reactions, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A) 6, B) 8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, let's break down each reaction step by step.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a bromination. Wait, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Oh right, under certain conditions, aldehydes and ketones can undergo addition reactions with bromine. But wait, wait, no, wait. Actually, when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine under specific conditions, it might undergo a halohydrin formation. Or maybe it's an addition to the carbonyl group. Alternatively, it could be a substitution if it's under different conditions, but I think more likely it's an addition.

Wait, no. Another thought: Maybe the first reaction is an epoxidation? No, wait, epoxidation is done with peracids, like mCPBA. Bromine is Br2, which is more of an addition reagent.

Wait, another possibility: Benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes and uses something like sodium cyanide. Maybe it's a nucleophilic attack
