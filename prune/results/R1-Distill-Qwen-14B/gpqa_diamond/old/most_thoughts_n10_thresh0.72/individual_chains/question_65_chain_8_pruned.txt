Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem has two reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I'll match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A:

The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reagents are THF, KH (which is potassium hydride), and H+.

Wait, THF is a solvent. KH is a strong base, right? It's used for deprotonation. Then, H+ is probably a source of protons, maybe in a work-up step. So, what's happening here? The molecule is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, usually the bridgehead.

Looking at the structure, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So it's a spiro ring system, with a vinyl group attached to the bridgehead. The bridgehead is the position where the two rings meet. The alcohol is on that bridgehead.

When you have an alcohol on a bridgehead in a spiro compound and you add a strong base like KH, I think it's going to deprotonate the alcohol. Wait, but wait, in THF, which is a polar aprotic solvent. So, the alcohol would be deprotonated, forming an alkoxide.

But then, when you add H+ in the work-up, the alkoxide would pick up a proton, but maybe that's not the main point here. Alternatively, maybe the base is doing something else.

Wait, another thought: spiro compounds under certain conditions can undergo ring-opening or rearrangement. If the base abstracts a proton, perhaps it's a possibility for elimination. But wait, the structure might have some strain that could lead to a more stable system upon elimination.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hydride or alkoxide attack leading to a ring expansion or contraction. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible mechanisms.

Wait, another possibility is that the spiro alcohol under basic conditions could form an enolate or some kind of conjugate base. Alternatively, since it's a bridgehead alcohol, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination to form a more stable structure, like a bicyclic compound.

Wait, another angle: the starting material has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the bridgehead. So when the base deprotonates the alcohol, maybe that's a good leaving group situation. But wait, the alcohol is on oxygen, so after deprotonation, it's an alkoxide. So, perhaps the O- could leave as a good leaving group, but wait, oxygen isn't a great leaving group. Unless it's part of an E2 elimination.

Wait, with a strong base like KH and in THF, maybe deprotonation leads to an E2 mechanism, where the base abstracts a proton, and the alkoxide leaves as O- (but that's not great, unless perhaps it's part of a conjugated system that can form a double bond).

Alternatively, could this be a case of pinacol rearrangement? Pinacol rearrangement occurs when a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) is treated with a strong base leading to the formation of a ketone. But wait, in this case, the molecule is a spiro alcohol, not a diol. So maybe not.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is forming a new ring. Because spiro compounds have two rings connected at one atom, perhaps upon deprotonation and elimination, another ring forms, leading to a bicyclic structure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Those typically involve carbocation shifts, but I don't see a carbocation here. Alternatively, if the base induces an elimination, perhaps forming a larger ring.

Wait, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non
