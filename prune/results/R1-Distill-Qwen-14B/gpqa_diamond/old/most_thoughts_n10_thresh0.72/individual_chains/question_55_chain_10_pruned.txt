Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting NMR spectra. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all acetates with either propenyl or butenyl groups, and they're either cis or trans. So, the structure must be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, acetate is more like an ester, right? Oh wait, acetate is an ester where the acetyl group is attached to an oxygen. So, the compound is an ester, like R-O-CO-O-R', but acetate would be something like CH3COO-R.

Wait, no, no. Wait, acetate esters are typically like R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Acetate esters are RCO-O-R. So for example, ethyl acetate is CH3CO-OCH2CH3. So in this case, the compound is an ester where the acetyl part is CH3CO-O- attached to some other group.

Wait, the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. So the structure would be something like CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2 (but that's propenyl) or CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2 (but that's butyl), but wait, butenyl implies a double bond.

Wait, no, butenyl is a four-carbon group with a double bond. So butenyl would be like CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond somewhere. But butenyl acetate would have the structure CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2 or similar? Hmm.

But looking at the NMR data: the peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

So let's think about each part. The 2.1 ppm singlet integrating for 3H must be a methyl group, probably attached to an oxygen because acetates have that. So that's probably the acetyl group: CH3COO-.

Then, the 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH2 group attached to something, maybe a double bond. Because in allylic positions, the protons are deshielded a bit, but a triplet or doublet could indicate coupling. Wait, the 1.6 is a doublet. So maybe it's a CH2 next to a CH that's part of a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets (dq), which is a bit tricky. That proton is likely part of a double bond. Let's think about vinyl protons. In an ester with a double bond, like propenyl or butenyl acetate, the protons on the double bond would split into specific patterns.

So, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which is typical for double double bonds, like a trans
