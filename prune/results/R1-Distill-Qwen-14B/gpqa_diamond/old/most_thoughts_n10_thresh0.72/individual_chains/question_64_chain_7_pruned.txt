Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what it's asking.

So, the problem is about heating an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three different tubes: one with Mg(ClO4)2, another with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper.

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 g.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80 g, and CuO is formed.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) doesn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each part step by step.

First, I need to figure out what each of these tubes does. 

Tube 1 is anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and reacts with water. So, any water vapor in the gas mixture would be absorbed here. So, the increase in weight of 3.60 g probably corresponds to the amount of water (H2O) in the gas mixture. So, the mass of H2O is 3.60 grams.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is passed through this, any CO2 gas would react. The reaction is CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3↓ + H2O. But in this case, the weight of tube 2 doesn't change. So, that implies that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. Because if there were CO2, it would have reacted, and the tube would have increased in weight as CaCO3 precipitated.

Wait, but wait. If the solution was in a tube, maybe any precipitate would cause a change in the tube's weight. Since the tube's weight didn't change, that suggests that no CO2 was present. Alternatively, maybe the solution didn't react, but that's unlikely unless there's no CO2.

Moving on to tube 3, which has red-hot copper. The gas passes through here, and the tube gains 0.80 g, with CuO formed. Copper is a reducing agent. When it's hot, it can react with certain gases. For example, if the gas is SO2, it could be oxidized. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when SO2 passes through hot copper, it might not react. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a halogen or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with a sulfur-containing gas. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2S. Let's think. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO3, but that's a strong acid and might not react with
