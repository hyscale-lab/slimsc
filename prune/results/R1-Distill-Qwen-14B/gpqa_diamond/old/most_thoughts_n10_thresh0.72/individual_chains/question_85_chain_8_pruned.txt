Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's read the question again. So there are two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, Teff 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3. Both have same albedo. The question is the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, what's the formula for equilibrium temperature? Oh right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). But wait, the albedo is the same for both, so that term will cancel out when taking the ratio.

But wait, I'm not sure if I'm remembering the formula correctly. Let me think. The planet's equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh right, the formula is T_planet = T_star * ( (L_star/(16πσ a²)) )^(1/4), but L_star is the star's luminosity, which is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR_star²σT_star^4. So substituting that in, the planet's temperature becomes T_planet = T_star * ( (R_star² σ T_star^4 / (16πσ a²)) )^(1/4). Simplify that, I think it becomes T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Right, so albedo is the same for both planets, so when we take the ratio, that term cancels out.

So the ratio of T1 to T2 is sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So now I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances.

Wait, but how do I find a1 and a2 from the given data? Let's see. The question mentions that both planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods. Oh, right, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and its orbital period, but I don't think the period is given here. Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shifts due to each planet on the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å.

So, the RV shift is the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ). Wait, that's complicated. But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and the star's mass is much larger (M_planet << M_star), the term simplifies.

I remember the approximation for K when M_planet << M_star: K ≈ ( (G M_p sin i) / ( ( (M_star)^2 (1 - e²) )^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1/(2π G ) )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 - e^2))^(0.5) ). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me think of the simplified version. A better approach might be the formula: K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) * (P) ) ) ).

Wait, but since the star's mass is much bigger than the planet, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And e is zero, so 1 - e²=1. So K simplifies to K ≈ (27 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3) ) * P ) ). But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) * ( (2 pi / P) )^(1/3) ). Hmm, perhaps I should look for a way to relate the Doppler velocity shift to the planet's orbital distance.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital period P and the star's velocity due to the planet's pull. But without the period, maybe I can find another approach.

Wait, but the problem says that both planets cause a Doppler shift. The shifts are up to 0.03 angstroms for Planet1 and 0.04 angstroms for Planet2. The line in question is [OI] at 6300 Å. Wait, that's an optical emission line, probably in the star's spectrum. The Doppler shift is measured as the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull.

So the RV semi
