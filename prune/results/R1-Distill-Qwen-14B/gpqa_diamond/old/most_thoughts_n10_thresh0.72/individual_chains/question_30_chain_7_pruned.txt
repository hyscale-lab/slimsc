Alright, I've got this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, okay, so the question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and it emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh right, because the absorbed energy causes electrons to jump to a higher energy level, and when they drop back, they release the energy as light. So the color we see is the complementary color of what's absorbed.

But wait, the question is about what color is absorbed, not the emitted. So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. I think the energy of the emitted photon relates to the energy difference between the excited and ground states of the electrons.

I should probably use the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. But wait, another approach is to convert eV to wavelength using the relation E (eV) = 1240 nm·eV / λ (nm). Oh, right, that's a quicker way.

So let's plug in E = 2.3393 eV. Rearranging the formula, λ = 1240 / E. So λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's see, 1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 2.3393 times 500 is about 116
