Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I'm guessing that's a two-component spinor, right? So it's a column vector with two elements. The first element is 3i, and the second is 4. Got it.

The question is about the expectation value of S_y, the spin operator along the y-axis. I remember that the expectation value is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the state vector again. So, in formula terms, that's ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

Wait, but what's the operator S_y? Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The sigma_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. But wait, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times sigma. So S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. That's important because I need to include that factor.

So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Got it.

The state vector ψ is given as (3i, 4). So I can write this as a column vector:
ψ = [3i; 4]. Wait, am I getting the order right? Sometimes it's row vs column, but I think for expectation values, the order is important. So ψ is a column vector: top component is 3i, bottom is 4.

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ψ† S_y ψ. Let me break that down. First, ψ† would be the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† is [ -3 (because conjugate of 3i is -3), 4 ] as a row vector.

So ψ† is [-3, 4]. 

Then, I need to compute ψ† multiplied by S_y, then multiplied by ψ.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute S_y acting on ψ first, then take the inner product with ψ.

Alternatively, do the matrix multiplication step by step.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute σ_y *
