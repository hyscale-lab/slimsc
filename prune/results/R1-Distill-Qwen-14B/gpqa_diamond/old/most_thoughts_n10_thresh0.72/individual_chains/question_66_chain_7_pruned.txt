Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries must be respected by all operators in it. Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators while maintaining certain symmetries. 

The question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to figure out which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

First, let's think about each symmetry.

Lorentz symmetry. I think that's the symmetry of special relativity, right? The operators in the SMEFT must respect this because they're part of a relativistic theory. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a yes.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, like a global symmetry. Oh wait no, Poincare is a combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. But in SMEFT, when you add operators, you have to include terms that are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the SM respects Poincare, do SMEFT operators have to as well?

Wait, but wait. The Standard Model itself is a Poincare-invariant theory. So any effective theory that's built on top of it should also respect Poincare symmetry. So the SMEFT operators must be Poincare symmetric as well. But wait, the question is about whether all operators must respect each symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, the options are numbered 1-4, and the choices are which of these must be respected. So option 1 is Lorentz, 2 Poincare.

But I'm a bit confused. Because, for example, the SM respects Poincare symmetry. So the effective operators added in SMEFT should also respect that. But are all operators in SMEFT Poincare symmetric? I think so, because the SMEFT is an effective theory that maintains the same symmetry structure as the SM. So yes, they must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but is that correct? Because the SMEFT is written in a way that includes terms that are compatible with the SM's symmetries. So if the SM has Poincare symmetry, the SMEFT must as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on this. Because Poincare includes things like translation invariance. If you have higher-dimension
