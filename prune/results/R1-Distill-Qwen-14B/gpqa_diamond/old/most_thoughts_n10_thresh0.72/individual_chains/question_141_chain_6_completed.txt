Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there?

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene with a bromine on position 1 and a deuterium on position 2? Or is that a typo? Wait, maybe I'm misreading it. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the structure would be benzene with a Br at position 1 and a D (deuterium) at position 2. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium substituent in the adjacent position.

The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Oh wait, but in what context? I think when aromatic halides are treated with strong bases like NaNH2, it might be a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, perhaps forming a benzyn intermediate. Or wait, no, the benzyn is a diradical or a triple bond, maybe? Or perhaps it's about elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, like a benzyne?

Wait, benzene rings with adjacent substituents can undergo elimination. So in the case of 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, if the Br is at position 1 and D is at position 2, then when NaNH2 is added, a base abstracts a proton, leading to the elimination of Br- and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, wait.

Wait, the molecule is Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So when the base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton, which hydrogen would it take? Let me visualize the benzene ring.

In 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. The adjacent positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6. So when the base comes in, it abstracts a proton, but where? Because the D is at position 2, which is a hydrogen that's been replaced by deuterium. So the H's available are at positions 3,4,5,6, and maybe also adjacent positions?

Wait, the reaction conditions: NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think that's typical for elimination. So in this case, if we have Br and D adjacent, upon treatment with a strong base, we can lose HBr, but wait, the D is not a H, so the base can't abstract a D because D is a different isotope and perhaps less reactive, but maybe in this case, the H at position 2 is deuterium, so the H in position 3 or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. The base (NH2^-) would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate, which is a triple bond. But wait, what's a β hydrogen in this context? In aromatic substitution, when you have adjacent leaving groups, elimination can occur.

Wait, the molecule is Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So when a base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2, that's the beta hydrogen relative to the Br. So, abstracting a hydrogen from position 3 would lead to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3, but wait, that's not adjacent to Br. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Alternatively, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1. So position 1 is Br, position 6 is a hydrogen. The base abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But then the Br is at C1, so elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, since the H is at C2's adjacent position. Wait, but C2 has a D, not an H. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, so Br is at C1, D at C2. So the possible positions for H abstraction would be adjacent to the Br, but with the D present.

So, the possible β hydrogens are the ones adjacent to the Br. But since the Br is at C1, the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has a D, so the hydrogen is deuterium. So, the base can't abstract that. So, the only β hydrogen available is at C6? Because C2 is D, so the H at C6 is adjacent to C1 (Br). So if the base abstracts H from C6, elimination occurs between C1 and C6, leading to a triple bond between C1 and C6? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the triple bond in benzene would be between adjacent carbons.

Wait, no. When an elimination occurs between adjacent carbons, you get a triple bond. For example, if you have Br at C1 and H at C2, elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But in our case, the H at C2 is replaced by D, so that's not available. So the base can't abstract a β hydrogen from C2 because it's a D. So the only available β hydrogen is at C6, which is adjacent to C1. So the base abstracts H from C6, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. So that would form a benzyn species with triple bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but benzyn usually refers to a triple bond between adjacent carbons, like C1 and C2. So if elimination occurs between C1 and C6, that's a para position, but in a benzene ring, C1 and C6 are adjacent (since benzene is a six-membered ring). Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So if you eliminate Br and H from C1 and C6, you form a triple bond between C1 and C6? Or between C1 and C2, but that's where the D is.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think again.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. So the neighboring positions to Br (1) are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D; position 6 has a hydrogen.

So when the base (NH2^-) abstracts a hydrogen, it can do so from position 6 (since position 2 is D). So the H is abstracted from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6, and the elimination of Br^-.

Wait, but wait. When elimination occurs, the Br leaves, and the electrons from the C-Br bond form a double bond or a triple bond. So eliminating H from C6 and Br from C1 would form a triple bond between C1 and C6? Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so C1 and C6 are adjacent. So the triple bond would be between C1 and C6, making a benzyn structure. But benzyn is usually between adjacent carbons, so C1 and C2 would be adjacent. But in this case, C1 and C6 are adjacent, so the triple bond would be between them.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond forms between C1 and C2, but since position 2 has a D, that can't happen. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D), but that's not adjacent to the Br. So elimination would not occur there.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product. When a Br is at position 1 and a D is at position 2, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the D at position 2.

But wait, benzyn is a highly strained molecule, so the product would immediately undergo some reaction. Or perhaps the triple bond can rotate, but in an aromatic ring, rotation isn't possible, so the triple bond would be fixed.

Wait, but after elimination, the ring would have a triple bond, creating a diradical or a very reactive species. This might not be stable, so perhaps the reaction proceeds further, such as forming a dideutero benzene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the dehydrohalogenation leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but that's not possible because position 2 has a D.

Wait, no, because the H was abstracted from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1. So elimination would occur between C1 (Br) and C6 (H), forming a triple bond between C1 and C6.

So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the D remains at C2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond forms between C1 and C2. But since position 2 has a D, that can't be. So maybe the H is abstracted from position 3 instead?

Wait, position 3 is not adjacent to the Br. So why would the base abstract a hydrogen from there? Because the base typically abstracts a β hydrogen, which is adjacent to the leaving group (Br). So in this case, the only available β hydrogen is at position 6.

So elimination leads to a triple bond between C1 and C6. So the product would be a benzyn (triple bond between C1 and C6), and the D is at C2.

Wait, but benzyn is a very reactive molecule and can undergo various reactions, like ring-opening or addition. But in this case, the reaction is just elimination, so maybe the product is only this triple bond.

But the question is about how many possible organic products are formed. So if this elimination occurs, how many products?

Wait, perhaps the base can abstract the H from position 6 (adjacent to Br), leading to one product. But maybe there's another possibility. Alternatively, is there another site where the base can abstract a hydrogen, leading to a different product?

Wait, the ring is symmetric. Let me think: the structure is Br at C1 and D at C2. So, if I rotate the ring, the positions would look the same. But perhaps because of the D, the molecule isn't symmetric. Let me visualize:

Positions: C1 (Br), C2 (D), C3 (H), C4 (H), C5 (H), C6 (H).

So, the base can abstract H from C6, which is adjacent to Br at C1. Alternatively, perhaps abstraction from C3 is possible? But C3 is not adjacent to Br, so it's not a β hydrogen. So the only β hydrogen available is at C6.

So elimination would lead to a triple bond between C1 and C6. So that's one product.

Wait, but wait. Could the triple bond shift? Once the triple bond forms between C1 and C6, perhaps the molecule could undergo ring-opening or some rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't stop at the triple bond but proceeds further. Wait, but the question is about the products formed. If the reaction stops at the triple bond, then there's only one product.

But wait, perhaps when the triple bond forms, the D is at C2, and the triple bond is between C1 and C6. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6 and a D at C2.

But wait, benzene rings can't have triple bonds except in specific cases and under certain conditions. Wait, maybe the product is a benzyn diradical, but that's a transient species. Alternatively, it could form a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium affects the reaction. If the H is abstracted from C6, the Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. So the product would be 1,6-dideutero benzene with a triple bond? Or wait, no, the D is at C2 and the triple bond is between C1 and C6. So the product would have the D at C2 and the triple bond between C1 and C6.

But how many such products are possible? Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the original molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. After elimination, the Br is gone, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6 (since H was abstracted from C6). So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

But what's the structure of benzene with a triple bond? It's a diradical or perhaps a very reactive intermediate, but perhaps in this case, it's a di-substituted product.

Wait, but if the triple bond is between C1 and C6, then the substituents are D at C2 and the triple bond between C1 and C6. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

But wait, perhaps the ring can undergo some isomerization, but I don't think so under these conditions. So the product would be a single structure.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the abstraction of H could occur from another position if the structure allows. But in this case, the only available β H is at C6, so the product is only one.

So the number of possible organic products would be 1.

Wait, but wait. What if the H is abstracted from a position that leads to different regiochemistry or stereochemistry?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't lead to elimination but to some substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile, so substitution is less likely. More likely elimination.

Wait, another thought: when benzene rings undergo dehydrohalogenation, the product is a diradical intermediate (benzyn), which can react with other substrates. But in this reaction, perhaps the benzyn is formed, and because of the D at C2, the diradical can form in different positions.

Wait, but in this case, the benzyn would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, which is the same as between C2 and C3, but no, because the D is at C2.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the possible products.

If the base can abstract the H only from C6, leading to only one product, then the answer is 1. But wait, perhaps there's another possibility.

Wait, perhaps the D at C2 affects the possibility of abstraction of H from C3.

Wait, the base abstracts a β hydrogen, which is adjacent to the leaving group (Br at C1). So the β positions are C2 and C6. But C2 has D, so the only available is C6. So only one product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a rearrangement or a different position of the triple bond.

Wait, another possibility: when the triple bond forms between C1 and C6, the ring becomes highly strained, so it might open up or something. But I don't think that's the case here; the question is about the products, and if elimination is the only step, then only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction could form more than one product if there are multiple sites for H abstraction. But in this case, only one site (C6) is available.

So the number of possible products is 1. So the answer would be option B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction proceeds via dehydrohalogenation, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond (benzyn intermediate). 

The starting material has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. For elimination to occur, the base (NH₂⁻) must abstract a β-hydrogen, which is adjacent to the bromine. The β-hydrogens are located at positions 2 and 6. However, position 2 has a deuterium (D), which is not abstractable by the base. Therefore, the only available β-hydrogen is at position 6.

When the base abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, elimination of Br⁻ occurs, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. The resulting product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6 and a deuterium at C2. This elimination leads to a single product because there are no other β-hydrogens available for abstraction.

Thus, the reaction produces only one organic product.

Answer: B
