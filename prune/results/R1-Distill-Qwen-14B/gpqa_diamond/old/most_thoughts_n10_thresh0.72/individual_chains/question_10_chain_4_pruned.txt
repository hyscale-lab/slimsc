Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question asks which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a choice. Hmm, right. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, so density = mass/volume. 

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is pretty well known. Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have the same density as Earth. 

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the problem states its density is 5.5, so that's the same as Earth, but twice the mass. Wait, but if the mass is twice but the density is same, what about the radius? Because density is mass/volume. If density is same, mass is proportional to volume. Volume scales with radius cubed. So if the mass is twice Earth's, then volume is twice, so radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. But the question says the density is about 5.5, so same as Earth. So option b's density is 5.5, same as Earth. 

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Let's break this down. If a planet has the same composition as Earth, then its density should be the same as Earth's, right? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, same composition implies same density, because density is a function of composition. So Earth's density is about 5.5. So if another planet has same composition, same density. So this planet's density is 5.5. But wait, the question is which has the highest? So same as others? Hmm, but no, wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The mass is 5 times Earth's. So if it's same composition, density same. So volume scales with mass as V = m/d, so V is 5 times Earth's volume. So Earth's volume is (4/3)πR²³, so if Earth's mass is m,
