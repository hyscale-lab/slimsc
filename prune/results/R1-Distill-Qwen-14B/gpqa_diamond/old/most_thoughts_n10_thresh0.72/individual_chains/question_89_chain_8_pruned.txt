Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's see what each step does.

First, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are heated with a strong base, I think an elimination reaction happens. So for each Br, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but since there are two bromines, maybe it forms an allene? Or maybe each elimination leads to adjacent double bonds?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane structure: Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 positions are both brominated. So when KOH is used, each Br would undergo elimination. Since each Br is on adjacent carbons (maybe?), wait, no, positions 1 and 3 are on the adamantane structure. Hmm. But if we have two Brs, perhaps the elimination leads to a diene? Or maybe a conjugated diene.

Wait, let me think again. When 1,3-dibromocyclohexane is treated with KOH, it can form cyclohexene via dehydrohalogenation, but since it's 1,3, maybe two eliminations would happen, leading to a conjugated diene? But adamantane is a more complex structure.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. KOH is a strong base, so elimination (E2) is likely. For each Br, elimination would form a double bond. So from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, after elimination, maybe we get 1,3-diene? Wait, but in adamantane, 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent. So maybe each Br is on a different face or something, but when heated, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? But I'm not entirely sure about the structure.

Wait, maybe the product after KOH is a diene, but in the case
