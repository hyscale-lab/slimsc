Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps: reaction with HCN, then reduction with H2 and Pd, followed by reaction with HNO2, and finally elimination to form E. Plus, there are some hints given, so I need to use those to figure it out.

First, let me outline the reactions:

1. A + HCN → B
2. B + H2 (Pd) → C
3. C + HNO2 → D
4. D → E (elimination of an inert gas)

The options are all cyclic ketones, which suggests that E is a ketone. Also, the hints mention IR spectra, which can indicate functional groups.

Looking at the hints:

a) Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. I remember that ylides are used in alkylation reactions, like the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction typically converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A reacts with a Wittig reagent to form that compound, A must be a carbonyl compound. The product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents, including a propenylidene group. So the starting material A probably is a cyclopentanone or something similar.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane. So the Wittig reagent (ylide) would have been something like (CH2-C(CH3)=PH3+), which when reacts with A, forms the alkene. So A must be an aldehyde or ketone. But since the reaction is with a ylide, which would typically react with a carbonyl group.

But wait, the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent. Let's think: the Wittig reaction forms an alkene. So maybe A is a cyclopentanone, and the ylide adds to the carbonyl, making a new double bond.

Wait, the product is cyclopentane with substituents. The starting material would have a carbonyl group. For example, if A is 4-methylcyclopentanone, then the Wittig reagent would add to the ketone. The ylide (propan-2-ylidene) would have the structure =CH-C(CH3)2 (I'm a bit fuzzy on ylide structures, but I think the ylide is something like PR3+=CH-), so when it reacts with the ketone, the oxygen is replaced by the ylide's R group, forming an alkene.

Hmm, perhaps I should draw this. Alternatively, maybe A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let's move on to the other hint.
