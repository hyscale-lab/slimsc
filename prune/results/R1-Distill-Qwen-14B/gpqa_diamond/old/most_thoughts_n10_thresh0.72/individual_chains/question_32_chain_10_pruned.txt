Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a specific nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the isotope must be... Let's see, lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. But wait, in a collider, it's typically ions with a charge. So if it's Li, which has a +3 charge (since it usually has 3 protons), then the ion would be LiÂ³+.

So, the mass we'll need is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. But wait, what's the mass of a Li-6 nucleus? I remember that the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy, but since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, maybe we should use the exact mass? Or perhaps we'll approximate using the atomic mass. Hmm, I think the exact mass of the nucleus is essential here because the energy calculation depends on it.

So, the energy of the ion in the collider is related to its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. But wait, in particle physics, when we talk about the energy of an ion in a collider,
