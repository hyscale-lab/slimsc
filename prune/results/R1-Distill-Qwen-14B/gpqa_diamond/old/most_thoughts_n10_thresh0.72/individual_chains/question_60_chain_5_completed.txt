Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think about it step by step. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. Oh right, that's from Einstein's theory of relativity.

The problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Wow, that's really close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective, their proper time.

Wait, wait. The question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so that's the proper time, right? Because proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference, which here is the astronaut's ship.

I think the formula for time dilation involves the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But since v is so close to c, gamma must be a large number. Let me calculate that.

So v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute v squared over c squared. V squared is (0.99999987)^2 * c², so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that: 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974. So 1 - 0.99999974 is 0.00000026. The square root of that is sqrt(0.00000026) which is about 0.00051. Because sqrt(2.6e-7) is about 0.00051.

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960. Hmm, wait, let me check that calculation again. Wait, 0.00051 is 5.1e-4. So 1 divided by 5.1e-4 is approximately 1960.78. So gamma is about 1960.8.

Wait, but wait, I think I should calculate this more accurately. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2 exactly. Let's see, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6. Squaring that: (1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a when a is very small. So a is 1.3e-6, so 2a is 2.6e-6. So 1 - 2.6e-6 is 0.99999974. So yes, that's correct.

So 1 - (v²/c²) is 2.6e-7. Square root of that is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.001 * 0.316 = 0.000316. So 1.612 * 0.000316 ≈ 0.000509, which is about 5.09e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 0.000509 ≈ 1964. So approximately 1964.

Now, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud isn't given, but wait, the problem says Earth is the destination. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy, but the question states that the aliens are in the Large Magellanic Cloud and want to reach Earth. So the distance is the distance from the LMC to Earth. Hmm. Wait, I don't think the actual distance is needed because perhaps the problem simplifies it.

Wait, wait, the question says: 'how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?' So we're being asked for the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Proper time is calculated using the Lorentz transformation. The formula for proper time tau is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and v is the speed.

Wait, but I don't have the distance. Oh wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem gives the speed but not the distance. Hmm, but maybe the question is more about the time experienced by the astronaut, not the actual time on Earth. Wait, but without the distance, perhaps the question is more about the effect of speed on time, regardless of distance. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually a trick question. Let's see: the spaceship is moving at v = 0.99999987c. The distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 light-years, but I'm not sure; perhaps that's incorrect. Wait, no, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is D = 160,000 light-years.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance. Hmm, maybe I misread the question. Let me reread it.

The question says: "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?"

Oh, right, so from the astronaut's perspective, the time taken is their proper time. So, the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, tau.

But to find tau, you need to know the time in Earth's frame (t) and then multiply by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, how do we find t in Earth's frame? Because t is the time Earth observes for the trip. Which is D / v, where D is the distance.

So, D is the distance between the LMC and Earth. Let's say D is approximately 160,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time is t = D / v.

So, v = 0.99999987 c. So D is 160,000 light-years. So t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, and c is 1 ly/year, t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 years.

Wait, that's a long time. But the astronaut's lifetime is 150 solar years. Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So from Earth's frame, the trip takes about 160,000 years. But with such a high speed, the astronaut's own time would be much less.

Wait, but from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. Because in their frame, the distance is Lorentz-contracted. So the distance they perceive is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D * (1/gamma), because sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is tau = D' / v. Let me compute that.

Tau = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / (v).

Wait, but D is 160,000 light-years. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of gamma. Because gamma is 1960. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/1960.

So D' = D * (1/1960). So D' = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ approximately 81.63 light-years.

Then tau = D' / v. But v is 0.99999987c. So D' / v = (81.63 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 81.63 / 0.99999987 ≈ about 81.63 years.

Wait, but wait, 81.63 is approximately 81.6, which is about 81.6 years. So the astronaut's proper time is about 81.6 years.

But the astronaut is 22 years old. 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years. Wait, but the average lifetime is 150 years. So would the astronaut live long enough? But wait, in their own frame, they would age 81.6 years, so 22 + 81.6 = 103.6, which is less than 150. So they would survive to reach Earth.

Wait no, the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, not their age. So the astronaut ages about 81.6 years during the trip. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6, which is less than 150, so they would survive. So the answer is approximately 81 years, which is option C.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, let me compute D' correctly. D is 160,000 light-years.

D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ D / gamma = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.63 ly.

Time for the astronaut is D' / v = 81.63 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 81.63 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.63 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ 81.63 * 1.00000013 ≈ 81.63 + 0.000106 ≈ approximately 81.63 years.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 81.63 years. So the closest option is C) 81 years.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 77 years. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for proper time. The proper time tau is given by the integral of sqrt(1 - v²/c²) dt, but since v is constant, it's just tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But t_earth is D / v. So tau = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

But D is 160,000 ly, v is 0.99999987c.

So let me compute that.

tau = (160,000 ly / (0.99999987 c)) * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, and c is 1 ly/year, this simplifies to:

tau = (160,000 / 0.99999987) * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

Wait, 160,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 0.21 ≈ 160,000.21 years.

sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) we already calculated as approximately 1/1960.

So tau ≈ 160,000.21 * (1/1960) ≈ 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.63 years.

So same result as before. So about 81.63 years, which is 81 years when rounded.

So option C is 81 years, which is the correct answer.

But wait, I thought option C was 81, but looking back, the options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question says, 'how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?'. So the time is about 81 years, so the astronaut would be 22 + 81 = 103 years old, which is under 150, so they would survive. So option A is incorrect.

So in the options, option C is 81 years, which matches the calculation. So the answer should be C.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience during the journey, we use the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of relativity. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 160,000 \) light-years. The proper time (\( \tau \)) experienced by the astronaut is calculated using the formula:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) is the time measured in Earth's frame, given by:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \)
Substituting \( D = 160,000 \) light-years and \( v = 0.99999987c \):

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

First, compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]

Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.99999974} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.00051
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.00051} \approx 1960.8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \frac{1}{\gamma}
\]

Substituting \( t_{\text{Earth}} \approx 160,000 \) years and \( \gamma \approx 1960.8 \):

\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{1960.8} \approx 81.63 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The astronaut's proper time for the journey is approximately \( 81.63 \) years. Adding this to the astronaut's initial age of 22 years, the total age upon arrival would be \( 22 + 81.63 = 103.63 \) years, which is less than the average lifetime of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 81.63 \) years is \( 81 \) years, which corresponds to option **C**.
