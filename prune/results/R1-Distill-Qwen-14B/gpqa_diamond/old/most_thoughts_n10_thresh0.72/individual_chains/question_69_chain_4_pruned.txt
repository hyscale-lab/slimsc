Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I should probably start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. I'm supposed to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I think the key here is calculating the lifetime as observed in the lab frame because particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes dilated. So the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle, but when it's moving, we have to consider the time dilation effect.

The formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) or equivalently, γ = E/mc², since E is the total energy. Wait, but wait, E is the total energy, which is given as 27 GeV. But the mass is 3.41 GeV, so I can compute γ as E/mass.

Let me calculate that. γ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me do the division: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 * 8 is about 27.28. So 27 is just a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So roughly, γ is approximately 7.91. Let me calculate it more accurately. 3.41 * 7.91 = let's see, 3.41*7=23.87, 3.41*0.91≈3.1031. So total is about 26.973, which is close to 27. So γ is about 7.91.

Now, the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 8 *7.91 is about 63.28, so τ ≈6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed. Oh right, the resolution of the detector is the smallest time it can measure. But how does that relate to the decay being observed?

I remember that for a particle moving, the minimum time resolution Δt needed to observe the decay is such that a significant fraction (like 30%) of the particles decay within the time window. The number of particles that decay is given by the decay probability, which is 1 - e^(-t/τ). 

We need at least 30% of the particles to decay, so 1 - e^(-t/τ) ≥ 0.3. Let me solve for t. Rearranging, e^(-t/τ) ≤ 0.7. Taking natural logs: -t/τ ≤ ln(0.7). So t ≥ -τ * ln(0.7). 

The natural log of 0.7 is approximately -0.3567. So t ≥ τ * 0.3567. 

So the minimum time the detector must resolve is t_min ≈ 0.3567 * τ. 

Wait no, wait. Wait, the decay probability is 30%, so the fraction that decay is 0.3. So 1 - e^(-t/τ) = 0.3 → e^(-t/τ) = 0.7 → -t/τ = ln(0.7) → t = τ * (-ln(0.7)) → which is τ * 0.3567. 

So
