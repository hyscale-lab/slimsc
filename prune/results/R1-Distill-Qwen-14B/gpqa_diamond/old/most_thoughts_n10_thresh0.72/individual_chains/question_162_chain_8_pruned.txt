Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact properties. Oh right, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. So their geometry is different from the usual spheres in Euclidean space.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like the metric for hyperbolic space, but I'm not sure. Let me recall. Hyperbolic space in 2D can be represented in different coordinate systems. For example, the Poincaré disk model uses a metric like (dx² + dy²)/( (1 - x² - y²)^2 ), but this doesn't look exactly the same.

Wait, let me check the given metric. The denominator here is (4 - x² - y²), not (1 - (x² + y²)). Also, the numerator is 32, not 4 or something else. Hmm.

So the line element is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's see, maybe it's scaled differently. Maybe the Poincaré disk model with a different scaling?

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. But in Cartesian coordinates, that would be (4/(1 - (x² + y²))^2) (dx² + dy²). But our metric is (32/(4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²). Hmm, so perhaps it's scaled by a factor.

Wait, if I factor out the 4 from the denominator, it becomes 4 - (x² + y²) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ). So the denominator is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ). So the metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )) (dx² + dy²) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Wait, that looks similar to the Poincaré disk model but scaled. The standard model has (1/(1 - r²)^2) factor, but here we have 8/(1 - (r²/4)), where r² is x² + y². So perhaps this is a scaled version.

Wait, let's think about the relation between the curvature and the scaling. In hyperbolic geometry, the Gaussian curvature K is related to the scaling factor of the metric. For the standard Poincaré disk, the curvature is K = -1/(radius)^2. Wait, no, I think the curvature is K = -1/(radius)^2, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe the radius is related to the curvature.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (dr² + r² dθ²)/( (1 - r²)^2 ), which corresponds to a hyperbolic plane with curvature K = -1. Wait, the Gaussian curvature
