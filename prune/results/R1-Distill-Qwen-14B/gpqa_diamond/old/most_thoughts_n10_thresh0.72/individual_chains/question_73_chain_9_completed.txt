Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a relative speed and total energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Let me recall the formula. I think it's something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, wait, no. Wait, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when one is moving at v1 and the other at v2. So in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator first. 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. So the numerator is 0.1c. Now the denominator is 1 minus (0.3c²)/(c²). 0.3c² over c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (0.1c)/0.7, which is approximately 0.142857c. That's roughly 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that narrows it down to C or D.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. So each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to calculate gamma for each, multiply by their respective masses, and sum them up.

Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that for each.

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy for astronaut 1: gamma * m c² * mass. Wait, wait, the mass here is 2m, so 2m * gamma1 c² = 2 * 1.25 * m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the relativistic energy is gamma * m_rest * c². So for the first astronaut, the rest mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3 * m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Approximately 5.96 mc². So looking at the options, C says E=5.96 mc² and D says E=5 mc². So the correct total energy is about 5.96 mc².

So from earlier, the relative speed was 0.14c, and the total energy is 5.96 mc². So the correct option would be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative velocity formula in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(0.14c\).
- The total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\).

This matches **Option C**, which states \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and \(E = 5.96m c^2\).
