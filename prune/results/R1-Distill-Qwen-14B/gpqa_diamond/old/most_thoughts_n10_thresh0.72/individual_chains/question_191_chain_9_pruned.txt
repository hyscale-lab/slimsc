Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the structure. So, it's a cyclohexanone ringâ€”so a six-membered ring with a ketone group on carbon 1. Then, on carbon 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. On carbon 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, wait. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the substituent is on the second carbon. So it's CH2- attached to the main chain, but the main chain is CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2- attached to a double bond. So the group is CH2-C(=CH2)-? Hmm. Maybe it's CH2-CH(CH2?), no, wait. Maybe it's CH2- attached to a carbon that's double-bonded. So maybe the structure is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: prop-1-en-2-yl is actually the same as isopropenyl. So it's CH2=C(CH2)-something. No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-
