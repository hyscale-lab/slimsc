Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, I remember that a triplet around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So that suggests there's an aldehyde group in the compound.

Looking at the other peaks, I see two doublets in the aromatic region. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm regions. That might indicate two sets of aromatic protons. Since they are doublets, maybe each is part of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two para-substituted phenyl groups attached to something else.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm peak is broad and as a singlet? Or is it a doublet of some sort? Wait, the description says 'bs' which I think stands for broad singlet. So that's 2H as a broad singlet. I'm not sure what that could be. Maybe it's some kind of coupling with adjacent groups. Or perhaps it's an enol structure, where the protons are exchanging and causing a broad peak.

Then there's the 3.66 ppm doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably a methylene group attached to something. Maybe an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. Or maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom. Since it's a doublet, perhaps it's part of a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 or some other group with two protons.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group, two benzene rings, and some kind of CH2 group.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5 degrees. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be two benzene rings (each contributes 3, so 6) but wait, no, two benzene rings would be 6. Wait, maybe there's a ring and a double bond or something else.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate. 2C +2 = 2*8 +2=18. H is 9. X is 0. N is 1. So 18 -9 +1 (since N counts as +1) = 10. Divide by 2: 5. So 5 degrees. So that could be one ring (benzene) and four double bonds? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, each ring or double bond is one degree. So perhaps one benzene ring (3 degrees), another ring or double bond (another 2), and maybe a carbonyl group (1). Wait, 3 + 2 + 1 =6, which is more than 5. Hmm. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me see: 8 carbons. The benzene rings have 6 carbons each. Wait, but if it's two benzene rings, that's 12 carbons, which is way more than 8. So maybe only one benzene ring. Wait, no, maybe the compound has two aromatic rings. But with 8 carbons, perhaps it's a substituted benzene with another substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's a diphenyl compound. Like two phenyl groups attached to another part of the molecule. So 6 carbons for each benzene, but that's 12, which is too much. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think of possible structures. Maybe a benzaldehyde derivative. Because the NMR shows an aldehyde proton. So perhaps a phenyl group attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another group.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm suggests an aldehyde (H-C=O). So that's one part. Then, the two doublets in the aromatic region. For a para-substituted benzene, each set of protons would be a doublet. So if the benzene has two substituents, each para to each other, like two substituents in para positions, each causing the neighboring H's to be a doublet.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the adjacent protons are actually in a para position. So in some cases, the coupling might lead to a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.

Wait, another thought: the d at 6.98 and 6.51 could be part of two different benzene rings. Maybe each ring is para-substituted, and each has an substituent which is causing the splitting. For example, two phenyl groups attached to a central chain.

So, the aldehyde is at one end, and then perhaps a chain connecting two benzene rings.

Wait, another peak is at 6.27 ppm, broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's an enol proton. Because enols can exchange protons and give broad signals. So if the molecule has an enol tautomer, that might explain the broad peak. Alternatively, it could be some kind of diol or another structure.

The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) suggests a CH2 group adjacent to something. Maybe an oxygen. For example, an ether (CH2-O-) or perhaps a carbonyl group, but that could be a ketone (but then you wouldn't have a CH2 group attached to a carbonyl as a doublet). Alternatively, this could be part of an enol structure, like CH2-CH(OH)-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde and an enol group. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a dihydroxy group or something else.

Wait, also considering the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl. That's typically a nitrous acid condition, which is used for diazotization, especially with aromatic amines. So maybe the starting compound has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If there's an NH
