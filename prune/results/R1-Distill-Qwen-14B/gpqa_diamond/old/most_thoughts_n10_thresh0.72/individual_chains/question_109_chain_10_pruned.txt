Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The system is in a 1S0 state. I remember that the notation for atomic states is (2S+1)L where S is total spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So 1S0 would mean S=0 because (2*0+1) =1. And L=0 because it's S, so orbital angular momentum is 0. So the initial state has spin S=0, L=0.

Then, the system emits a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. The question is about Pauli statistics and the conditions on the final state of the NN system. The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, what's T, S, L here? Oh right, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the final NN state has T=0. So T_final is 0.

The options are about which partial wave is not permitted. Partial waves are denoted by their angular momentum quantum numbers. Each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a certain state plus a particle (like p for a particle with angular momentum l=1, I think).

The problem involves conservation of angular momentum and parity. So I need to consider both.

First, let's understand the process: The initial state is 1S0, which is NN in 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, so the process is NN → NN' + X. Wait, but in the options, I think it's written as initial state → final state + X. For example, option A is 1S0 →7D1 + p. So the final state of the NN system is 7D1, and the emitted particle is p (probably a proton, which has spin 1/2, but more importantly, its angular momentum state is l=1, since p is the first letter after s, so l=1).

Wait, but the problem is about whether the partial wave is allowed based on angular momentum and parity conservation.

So, in the emission process, the orbital angular momentum L of the emitted particle
