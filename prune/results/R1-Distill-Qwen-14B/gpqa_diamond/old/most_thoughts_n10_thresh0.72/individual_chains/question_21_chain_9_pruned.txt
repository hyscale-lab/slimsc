Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answers. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It's asking about two compounds (benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) and which one doesn't show tautomerism (part A). Then, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism (part B).

Alright, let's tackle part A first. I need to determine which of the two compounds doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair of electrons between adjacent atoms, leading to different structures (like keto-enol tautomerism in ketones or aldehydes). So, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione—do either of them show this?

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone groups (O) attached. Depending on the positions, it could be ortho, meta, or para. But benzoquinone (para) has the structure O=C6H4=O. Wait, but more accurately, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So, does this compound have any acidic hydrogens that can tautomerize?

In benzoquinone, the hydrogens on the ring are all equivalent (in the para case), but I'm not sure if they can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe the quinone structure is more about conjugation than tautomerism. Wait, but quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. But wait, actually, the carbonyl groups are adjacent in some cases. Oh wait, no—benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups in para positions. So each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. Do they have any alpha hydrogens? No, because in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are directly attached to the benzene, which doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, the alpha position would be the benzene ring—like
