Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is often analyzed using partial waves, and those are connected to phase shifts. The question gives me some phase shifts, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4. The values are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Oh, and the options are A to D with some numerical values. The question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I think that means we only consider these up to δ4.

I'm trying to recall the formula for the scattering amplitude. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f can be expressed as a sum over all the partial waves. The general form is something like f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ] * e^{iδ_l} * (sin δ_l)/ ( (1 + cosθ)^l ) ... Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Or maybe it's better to think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f is given by a sum over angular momentum states. Each term involves (2l+1) times some functions involving the phase shifts δ_l.

Wait, more accurately, the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(s,θ) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} ( \frac{\sin δ_l}{(1 + cosθ)^l} ) ) / (ik)

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the partial wave expansion for f is given by:

f(s,θ) = (1/(ik)) \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} ( sin δ_l ) ( (1 - cosθ)^l / (1 + cosθ)^{l} ) ) 

Wait, no, perhaps another way. Alternatively, the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude relate to the phase shifts. Oh, right! The scattering amplitude can be written as f = f_r + i f_i, where f_r is the real part and f_i is the imaginary part. The imaginary part
