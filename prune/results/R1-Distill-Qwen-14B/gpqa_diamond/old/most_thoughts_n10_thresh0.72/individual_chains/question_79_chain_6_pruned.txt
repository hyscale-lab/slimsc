Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the reaction product's NMR data. 

So, compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to match them to one of the options A to D.

Hmm, what's the reaction here? Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. It's often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions typically leads to the formation of an alkoxide, but wait, the solvent is nonpolar. Maybe it's a ring-opening followed by a rearrangement or something else?

Wait, no, another thought. Oh, wait! There's another reaction involving epoxides and such reagents. Diazabicyclooctane is used in the Sharpless epoxidation? No, wait, Sharpless is for epoxidizing double bonds. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a base that induces some kind of elimination or rearrangement. Alternatively, could it be a ring-opening of an epoxide? If compound X is an epoxide, reacting with a strong base could cause ring-opening. But wait, the product's NMR shows a certain pattern that might suggest a new structure.

Alternatively, maybe compound X is a styryl ether or something that upon treatment with a base undergoes some kind of decomposition or rearrangement. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all options except D are oxirane derivatives. D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is an epoxide with styrene groups. Oxirane is another name for epoxide, so all are epoxides except D is also an epoxide? Wait, no
