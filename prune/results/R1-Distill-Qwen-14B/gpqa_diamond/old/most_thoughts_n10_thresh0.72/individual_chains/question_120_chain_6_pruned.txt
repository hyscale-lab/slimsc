Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So, plx = 1/distance, which means as distance increases, parallax decreases. Right.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Wait, stars are distributed uniformly in the sky. Does that mean uniformly in the sky's area, or uniformly in space? Oh, I think it's about their spatial distribution. But wait, the problem states stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which might mean they're spread out uniformly over the celestial sphere. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe it's more about their distribution in space, particularly in terms of distance.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the formula for the number of stars in a given volume. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density n is constant. So, the number of stars in a volume V would be n * V.

Now, parallax is a measure of distance. So, for a star at distance d, its parallax p is p = 1/d (in parsecs, I think). So d = 1/p.

Wait, but we're looking at the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's think in terms of each thin shell of stars at a particular distance. Each shell has a certain thickness, which would correspond to a range in parallax.

So, imagine I have a shell between distances d and d + dd. The volume of this shell is the surface area of the sphere with radius d times the thickness dd. So, the volume V_shell = 4πd² dd.

But since we're dealing with parallax, let's express everything in terms of p. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So, the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (dp). Because when d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait,
