Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission. Hmm, let's see. So, the question is about calculating the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value obtained using the classical approximation.

Wait, the initial setup says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. And the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh right, and we're ignoring electrons, so I don't have to worry about that.

So, first, let me parse the problem. Let me denote the two fragments as fragment 1 and fragment 2. Let m1 be the rest mass of fragment 1, m2 the rest mass of fragment 2. The problem states that m1 is twice m2. So m1 = 2*m2.

Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. Because the sum is 99% of M.

Since m1 is twice m2, substituting:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 0.99 M.

So m2 = (0.99/3) M, which is 0.33 M. And m1 is 0.66 M. So m1 is 0.66 M and m2 is 0.33 M. Wait, 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, yes.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So if fragment 1 has momentum p, fragment 2 has momentum -p. But wait, but their masses are different. Hmm, so I'll have to calculate their velocities or momenta.

Wait, but when you split into two fragments, each moving in opposite directions, the total momentum remains zero. So, the momentum of each is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but the masses are different. So, I think the velocities will be different, but the momenta will balance.

So, the problem is about the kinetic energies. But the question asks for the difference between the correct T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the classical approximation.

I think the classical
