Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's got components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, these components usually correspond to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each multiplied by ħ/2 to get the momentum operators. 

So, P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz). Since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Now, the operator P would be the sum of the components in each direction multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrices. So, P = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because the direction is arbitrary, we can parameterize it using an angle θ, perhaps. Let me think, since it's in the x-z plane, maybe theta is the angle from the z-axis? Or from the x-axis? Hmm.

Wait, for a direction in the x-z plane, the general direction can be described by an angle φ from the x-axis, but since the problem says "arbitrary direction in x-z plane", maybe theta is the polar angle measured from the z-axis. Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, if I'm in the x-z plane, the direction would be along a vector (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, for the x-z plane, the angle phi is the angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane, but since y is zero, maybe φ here is the angle in the x-z plane. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the direction can
