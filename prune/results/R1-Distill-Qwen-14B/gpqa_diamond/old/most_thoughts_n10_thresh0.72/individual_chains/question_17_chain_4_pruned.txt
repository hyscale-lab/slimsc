Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The stoichiometric complex means that each Ca^2+ ion is bound by one EDTA^4- molecule. So the complex is CaEDTA^2- perhaps?

Wait, the formation constant (Kf) is given as 5e10. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, the EDTA isn't just in the -4 charge form. EDTA can exist in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal, which I think means that the pH is such that EDTA is in the form that allows the formation constant to be valid. So we can probably ignore the protonation and just use the given Kf.

So the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote this as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. But wait, the complex is stoichiometric, so each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables:

Let’s let s be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions in solution. Since each complex releases one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^
