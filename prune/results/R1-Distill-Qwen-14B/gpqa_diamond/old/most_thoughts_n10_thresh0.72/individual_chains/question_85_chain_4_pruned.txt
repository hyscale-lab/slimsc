Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). But wait, are the albedos the same for both planets? Oh yes, the problem states they have the same albedo, so that part cancels out.

Wait, but how do I find the distances of the planets from the star? Because I don't have the distances directly. Oh, the problem gives me data from the transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method gives the radius of the planet relative to the star's radius, but I don't think that directly gives the distance. Oh right, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the distance from the star via the Doppler shift. Oh, wait, the RV method gives the semi-major axis (distance) via the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem says that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. I think the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and the distance. The formula for RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^0.5 * (1 AU)^0.5 ) ) * ( (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star)) )^(1/3) ). Wait, maybe I'm mixing some variables here.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift being proportional to the velocity of the star caused by the planet. The velocity is given by (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star)) )^(1/3). Hmm, this is getting
