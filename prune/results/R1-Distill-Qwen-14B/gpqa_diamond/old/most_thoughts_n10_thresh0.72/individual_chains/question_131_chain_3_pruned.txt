Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked. So, there's a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. They dehydrated it to form an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR spectra: 1H shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and 13C has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3.

The key part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. The question is asking which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product's NMR.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each part.

First, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis alkene. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride, which has the structure where two carboxylic acid groups lose a water molecule. Since the starting alkene is cis, the dehydration would lead to a cis arrangement in the anhydride.

Looking at the NMR data of the anhydride: 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which usually corresponds to something deshielded, like an aromatic proton. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride, which might have conjugated carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe there are protons in an environment that causes this shift, like an aromatic ring. Wait, but if the starting material is a diacid with an alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride without any aromatic rings. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, 7 ppm is more like a proton near an electronegative atom or in a conjugated system. In an anhydride, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups could be deshielded. But if the 1H NMR shows a single peak, that suggests all equivalent protons. So maybe it's a bridged structure or a symmetric group.

Wait, another possibility: The 7 ppm peak could be from an aromatic ring. But the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene. How does that lead to an aromatic ring? Oh, wait, maybe the dehydration leads to a cyclic anhydride, which might undergo further cyclization, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is formed across the double bond, leading to a ring structure.

Wait, the 13C NMR of the anhydride has peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an electronegative group—like a carbonyl. Wait, 137 ppm is more like a carbon with one double bond, maybe a sp² hybridized carbon. 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone or ester. So the anhydride has carbonyl groups.

Wait, the anhydride structure could be a cyclic structure, like something with two carbonyl groups. So, maybe the dehydration forms a five-membered ring, which is common for cyclic anhydrides.

But wait, the initial structure is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So when it dehydrates, it would lose a water molecule and form a double bond in the anhydride. Alternatively, perhaps it's a maleic anhydride structure. Wait, maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride derived from maleic acid (which has a cis-alkene). So maybe that's the structure here.

In that case, the 1H NMR of maleic anhydride shows a specific pattern. Wait, but I thought maleic anhydride's 1H NMR has a singlet? Or does it have two doublets? Wait, maleic anhydride is a symmetrical structure. The protons are on the same carbon, so they are equivalent. So in the 1H NMR, there's a singlet at around 7 ppm. That makes sense with the data given—single peak at 7 ppm.

And in the 13C NMR, the
