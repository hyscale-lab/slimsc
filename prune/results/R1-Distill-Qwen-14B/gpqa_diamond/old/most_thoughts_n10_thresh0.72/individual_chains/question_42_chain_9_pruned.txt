Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the orbital periods of three exoplanets. They discovered them using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure about that right now; maybe it's not super relevant for solving the problem.

So the problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 it's about 2.3. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by a factor of 1.4, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3. So the temperatures are going down as we go from Planet1 to Planet3. 

Then, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of 1.15, meaning Planet2 is 15% more massive than Planet1. Between Planet2 and Planet3, the mass ratio is 1.35, so Planet3 is 35% more massive than Planet2. So the masses are increasing from Planet1 to Planet3. 

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. So albedo shouldn't factor into the calculations beyond what's given, but I think it's used in the equilibrium temperature formula.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = [(L (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4)

But wait, maybe it's better to express it in terms of the star's luminosity and the distance. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

Te = Te_earth * sqrt(R_star / R_sun) * (1 / sqrt(a)) 

Wait, no, I think the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between absorbed and emitted radiation. So the formula is something like:

Te = Te_earth * sqrt( (1 - a) ) / sqrt( a )

Wait, no, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = Tstar *
