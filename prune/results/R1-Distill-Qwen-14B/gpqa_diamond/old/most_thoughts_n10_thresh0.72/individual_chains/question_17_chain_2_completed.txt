Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They ask what the concentration of calcium ions is.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the K value given is the formation constant, which tells us about the stability of the complex. A high K means the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.

So the formula for the formation constant K is important here. The general equation for the formation of the complex would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Right, and since K is so large (5e10), it means the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex. So, in solution, most of the Ca is bound as CaEDTA²−, and very little is free Ca²+.

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote this as C. So, initially, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, and we're assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, meaning all the Ca is in the complex form. But wait, since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, it's a 1:1 chelation with Ca²+.

Now, the question is about the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Let's think about the dissociation of the complex. Since K is large, the dissociation isn't significant, but we can calculate it using K.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, when the complex dissociates, each mole of CaEDTA²− releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−.

So, the initial concentrations:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4−] = 0

Change:
[CaEDTA²−] decreases by x → 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] increases by x → x
[EDTA^4−] increases by x → x

So, at equilibrium:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

Now plug into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−}) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-12 /5 → wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 *3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 4e-13 is under the square root. sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 *3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That looks correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate. So:

K = 5e10 = (0.02) / (x²)

So x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. Yep, that's right.

So the [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7 M, which corresponds to option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions at equilibrium. Since the dissociation of the complex is minimal (due to the large \( K \)), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). At equilibrium:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x, \quad [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02
\]

Substituting into the \( K \) expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
