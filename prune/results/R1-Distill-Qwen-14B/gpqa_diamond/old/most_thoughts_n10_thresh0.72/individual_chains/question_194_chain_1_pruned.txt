Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about partition functions. Hmm, let's see. The question is about three spins, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, right, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So for each state, I calculate the energy and then take the exponential of -β times that energy, then sum all those terms.

But how many states are there? Each spin has two possibilities, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. So I need to list all possible S1, S2, S3 combinations and calculate E for each.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without enumerating all 8. Let me think about the energy expression. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So, for each pair, if the spins are aligned (+1 each or -1 each), their product is +1. If opposite, -1.

Wait, but since E is multiplied by -J, let's think about what each term contributes. Let me consider each term S_i S_j. If S_i and S_j are the same, S_i S_j = +1. If different, -1. So each term contributes +1 or -1, and the sum of the three terms is say, m. Then E = -J m.

So m can range from, what, -3 to +3. Because each term is either +1 or -1, and there are three terms. So m could be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1).

Wait, let me think again. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me compute this for all possible spin states.

Another approach: for three spins, the number of possible states is 8. Let's enumerate them.

Let me list all possible S1, S2, S3 and compute each term.
