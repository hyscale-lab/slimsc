Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because of this, when the star rotates, the brightness variations look similar to those caused by an exoplanet. The task is to find out what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variations as the spotted star.

Hmm. I remember that both starspots and exoplanets can cause dips in a star's brightness when they pass in front of us. The key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) for both scenarios and set them equal, then solve for the planet radius.

Let me break this down. First, I'll think about the star with spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer. The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

The filling factor is 20%, which means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, but the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 (filling factor) multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if it's 20%, then 20% of the entire star's surface is covered. But the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. Oh wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Hmm, so maybe the filling factor is for that hemisphere. So 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. Or is it 20% of the entire star's surface? That needs to be clarified.

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So perhaps 20% of that hemisphere's area is spots. Hmm, but I
