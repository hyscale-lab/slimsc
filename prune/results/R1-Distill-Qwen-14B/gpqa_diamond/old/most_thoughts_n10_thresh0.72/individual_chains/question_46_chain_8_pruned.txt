Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is especially good for ring-closing and ring-opening metathesis as well as cross metathesis.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methyl pent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pent has five carbons. Let me count: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, 3-methyl pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should write the structure correctly. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So, the structure should be CH2=CH-CH

Okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right?

So, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But since it's a double bond, maybe the structure is more important here. Let me draw the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait no, wait, pent has five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, wait no, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Oh wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me number the chain. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, wait. Let me count. For pentene, the chain is five carbons. 1-ene is between C1 and C2. So positions 1 and 2 are double bonded. Then, the 3rd carbon (C3) has a methyl group. So the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons in a row. Wait, no, because I think I might have messed up the chain. Let me write it again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So adding a methyl group on the third carbon—so the structure becomes CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh no, wait, pentane has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, that's four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's count. The main chain has five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. The methyl is on C3. So the structure is: CH₂=CH
