Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull as it orbits. So, the star moves a bit, and we see this movement via the shifting of spectral lines.

The setup: Two stars with the same mass (like our Sun). Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detects these planets.

The key data points:
- Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms in the spectral line.
- Planet #2 causes a shift of up to 7 milliangstroms.

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I think the Doppler shift is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Wait, no, I recall that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. Oh right! The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i)/(M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part goes away. Also, since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar mass (Neptune-like), perhaps those factors cancel out.

Wait, but let me get the exact relationship. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for a simplified
