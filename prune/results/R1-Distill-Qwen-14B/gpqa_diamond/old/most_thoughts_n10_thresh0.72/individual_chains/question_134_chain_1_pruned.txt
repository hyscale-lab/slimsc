Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. They're all being mixed together. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but I see the options have kcal and kJ, so I have to be careful about units.

Wait, the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. Oh right, the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to produce one mole of water. But wait, wait—this reaction involves multiple acids and a base. Hmm, maybe I should find the equivalents of each and see which is the limiting reagent.

First, I'll write down the volumes and molarities:

- HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M.
- H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M.
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M.

I need to figure out how much acid and base each contributes. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic (donates two H+ ions per molecule), and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base which is diprotic as well (since Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions).

So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+ ions. Similarly, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- ions.

So the total equivalents (or millimoles) of H+ from acids and OH- from bases will determine the net reaction.

Let me calculate the millimoles of each:

HCl: 0.2 M * 500 mL = 100 mmol of H+ (since HCl is monoprotic, so 1 mole H+ per mole HCl).

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 300 mL = 90 mmol of H2SO4. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 90 * 2 = 180 mmol H+.

So total H+ from acids: 100 + 180 = 280 mmol.

Now the bases: Ba(OH)2. 0.5 M * 200 mL = 100 mmol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 100 * 2 = 200 mmol OH-.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ is 280 mmol, and OH- is 200 mmol. The limiting reagent here is OH-, since
