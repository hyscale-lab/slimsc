Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about comparing the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting a star versus the variation caused by star spots. Hmm, I remember that when a planet passes in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, which we detect as a dip in brightness. Similarly, star spots can cause brightness variations when the star rotates and the spots come into and out of view.

The problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So, Rstar is the same as the Sun's radius, which I think is about 7e5 km, but maybe the exact value isn't needed since we'll be taking a ratio.

The star has a filling factor of 20% for the spots. Wait, what's a filling factor? Oh right, it's the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% of the star's surface is covered in dark spots. But the spots are on only one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. But for the purpose of calculating the brightness variation, I guess the maximum brightness dip would be when the maximum area of spots is facing us.

The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is 5000 K. But how does this affect the brightness?

I remember that the flux from a star is proportional to T^4, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So the normal star emits more flux than the spots. When a spot is facing us, it contributes less flux than the surrounding area.

So, if the star didn't have spots, the brightness variation would be due to a planet transiting. The dip is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The area ratio is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But in the presence of spots, the dip when spots are visible would be a combination of the spot coverage and their temperature. Wait, the question says that the situation with spots can closely resemble an exoplanet. So, the observed brightness variation is similar to what a planet would cause. Therefore, we need to set the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots equal to that of a planet transiting.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: to produce the same amplitude signal in the star
