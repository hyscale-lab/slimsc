Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. I'll read it again and see what I can figure out.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction and forms another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids via a disproportionation reaction. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenating both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Z is a component of Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated. Additionally, mixture X has no conjugated multiple bonds.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the initial mixture X has two liquids that react. Since they decolorize bromine water, they must have double bonds because alkenes (or maybe some other unsaturated compounds?) can decolorize bromine. But wait, sometimes other things like aromatic compounds can do that, but since after hydrogenation you get a single hydrocarbon, maybe X contains alkenes.

Then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, in the question, it's an equimolar mixture X turning into another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids. So maybe each component of X is undergoing a reaction that changes each into two different compounds, but since X is equimolar, Y ends up with two substances in equimolar amounts.

Wait, but the problem says it's a mixture of two liquids in X. So each of them, perhaps, undergoes a reaction. But the reaction is a disproportionation. So maybe each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe X is just a single compound that undergoes disproportionation into two products, making Y a mixture of two.

Wait, but no, the question says X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each of those two liquids is undergoing a reaction, but each is undergoing a different reaction, or perhaps one of them is undergoing a disproportionation. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the hydrogenation part.

Hydrogenation of X and Y gives only Z. So when X is hydrogenated, both components in X (since it's a mixture) would presumably hydrogenate, but the result is only Z. So that suggests that both components of X, when hydrogenated, give the same product Z. Wait, that's interesting. So each component of X, when hydrogenated, gives Z.

Similarly, when Y is hydrogenated, it also gives Z. So perhaps Y's components, when hydrogenated, give Z as well.

So Z must be a completely saturated compound, since it's formed by hydrogenation and doesn't react further. So Z is an alkane.

Now, let's think about the hydrogen percentage. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z.

Hydrogen mass is 14.28%, so the carbon and hydrogen are the only elements, as it's a hydrocarbon. Let's call it CnH2m.

Wait, but for a hydrocarbon, the formula is CnHm. Wait, wait, no. Hydrocarbons can be alkanes (CnH2n+2), alkenes (CnH2n), or alkynes. But Z is an alkane because it's fully hydrogenated and doesn't react further. So Z is an alkane, so formula is CnH2n+2.

But wait, let me confirm. For example, ethane is C2H6, which is an alkane. So general formula is CnH2n+2.

So the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2) ) *100%. Wait, let me calculate that.

Hydrogen mass fraction = (
