Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have threefold symmetry with all edges equal and all angles equal. The question gives me the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )) ), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Oh right, I think the general formula is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h k + h l + k l) (cos theta) ) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, in a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But for rhombohedral, which is a special case of hexagonal or something else?

Wait, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice where all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are equal. So it's a special case where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors. Because in a rhombohedral system, the structure factor includes cosines of the angles.

Wait, yes, I think the correct formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hk + kl) cos θ ), but wait, no, is it 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal system. The general expression for the interplanar distance is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a
