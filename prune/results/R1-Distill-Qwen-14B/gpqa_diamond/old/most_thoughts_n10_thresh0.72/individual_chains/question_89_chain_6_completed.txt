Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, the first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, yielding a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. When dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, especially under high heat, elimination reactions are common.

So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Since it's a vicinal dibromide (adjacent Br atoms), the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So product 1 would be an adamantene derivative with a double bond. Wait, but the question says it's a light yellow solid. That makes me think it's an elimination product, like an alkene, because alkenes can be colored (like some being yellow).

Looking at the IR data, there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, product 1 was formed by elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So how does a carbonyl form? Did I miss something? Oh wait, perhaps after elimination of HBr, another reaction occurs. Alternatively, maybe the KOH isn't just doing elimination but also something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement or another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But that doesn't fit with the IR data. Wait, no, the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or ketone. But elimination would give an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't just elimination but something else, like a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else.

Wait, another thought: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two HBr molecules and forming an alkyne. Because two adjacent Br atoms—if each elimination removes one Br and forms a double bond, maybe with two eliminations, you get a triple bond. But then, would that give a ketone or something else? Alternatively, maybe it's forming an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction again. Dibromides reacting with KOH can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form a double bond, but the structure of adamantane is such that the double bond would be in a specific position. But the IR data shows a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is an ketone or ester.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is a diol. If KOH is a nucleophile, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Brs, so perhaps it's a vicinal diol. But diols typically don't have strong IR peaks at 1720. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But then the IR would show an epoxide peak around 1200 cm⁻¹, I think. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester, but how?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction forms a carbonyl group via elimination. For example, if the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to a Br, leading to formation of a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require the leaving groups to be in a position that allows such a mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a peroxide, but I don't think that fits.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the NMR data of product 1. The H-NMR has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a CH₂ group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. The 1.94 ppm is maybe another CH₂ group, perhaps more shielded, perhaps part of a cyclohexane-like structure. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely a set of equivalent CH₂ groups in a ring structure, like adamantane.

Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, the CH₂ would be deshielded and appear around 3-4 ppm. But the 4.79 ppm could be an oxygen-bearing group, maybe an ether or an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but then it would be more downfield.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is an ester. If the base somehow caused a substitution where a Br is replaced by an O⁻K⁺, which upon acid workup would give an alcohol. But that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, what if the base abstracts a proton, and the Br leaves, but then another reaction occurs. Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the -OH from KOH attacks, but in a vicinal dihalide, that would form a diol. But that would be a substitution, not elimination.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what would give a carbonyl IR peak. A ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, etc. Among these, which is likely from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH.

Wait, another approach: What if the reaction forms an epoxide? But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, causing elimination to form a double bond, but maybe the structure is such that the double bond is in a conjugated system leading to a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl because of a retro-aldol or some other cleavage. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction or something else, but I'm not recalling clearly.

Wait, maybe I should think about the workup. After the reaction, the product is a light yellow solid. Alkenes are usually colorless or maybe slightly colored. But some conjugated dienes can have color. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, which is often a yellowish solid.

Wait, wait, maybe the initial product is a diketone. But how? Hmm. Another possibility: The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with KOH, maybe it undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice to form an alkyne. Because two eliminations would remove two HBr molecules, leading to a triple bond. So the product is 1,3-diamantadiyne? Or perhaps a compound with a triple bond.

But then, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ would have to come from something else. Alternatively, if the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the base attacks a Br, but since it's a vicinal dihalide, perhaps it's a SN2 substitution, but with two Brs, maybe it's a double substitution, leading to a diol. Wait, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclic ketone. Wait, perhaps the base induces an elimination, but in such a way that a carbonyl is formed. For example, in the Hofmann elimination or some other mechanism where a double bond and a carbonyl form.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but perhaps the structure allows for a conjugated diene or something that could tautomerize to a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe the product is an enone.

I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Let me try to think about the subsequent steps, perhaps that can help.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1's structure would determine what reaction occurs. If product 1 is an alkene, perhaps it undergoes some addition reaction.

Wait, if product 1 is an alkene, heating with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 might induce some kind of carbocation rearrangement or perhaps a dienophile formation. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If product 1 is a carbonyl compound, like a ketone, then Al(OiPr)3 might act as a catalyst for some kind of acylation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, then with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it could open in a certain way, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. If so, Al(OiPr)3 might help in forming an ether or something else.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me think again about product 1.

The NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me consider the integration. The 4.79 is 2H, the 2.4-2.23 is 10H (so 5 CH₂ groups?), and 1.94 is 2H.

Wait, 10H in a multiplet suggests a number of equivalent CH₂ groups in a ring, perhaps the adamantane structure. The 4.79 ppm is probably an OCH₂ group, maybe an ether or an ester. The 1.94 ppm is perhaps another CH₂ adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak. That's characteristic of a carbonyl, like a ketone (around 1715 cm⁻¹), ester (about 1735-1750 cm⁻¹), or maybe an aldehyde (around 2820 cm⁻¹ for the stretch, but the carbonyl is around 2720, but that's a different region). Hmm, so 1720 is more like a ketone or possibly an ester. But in the case of esters, the carbonyl is usually higher, like 1740. So perhaps it's a ketone.

So if product 1 is a ketone, how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps the base induces an elimination, forming a ketone. If the structure allows for the formation of a carbonyl group upon elimination. So, for example, if a β-hydrogen is abstracted, and the adjacent Br leaves, forming a double bond, but perhaps in a way that leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene that forms a carbonyl via some cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclopropane ring, which upon ring-opening forms a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the product is a peroxide. For example, if two Br's are replaced by O groups. But I'm not sure what the NMR would look like for that.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a dialkyl ether. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl IR peak.

Wait, perhaps the product is a geminal diol after substitution, but that would be a diol, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the reaction conditions again. KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely than substitution, especially with vicinal dihalides.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (with IR carbonyl). Maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some oxidation. But wait, the reaction is with KOH, not an oxidizing agent. So maybe not.

Wait, maybe it's a Claisen-like condensation? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether. But that would have an ether peak in IR, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl. Let me imagine the structure.

If the adamantane has two adjacent Brs, and upon elimination, two HBr molecules are removed, perhaps forming a triple bond. But how would that lead to a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a diene, which under basic conditions might form a carbonyl via some cycloaddition or other process. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then eliminates Br⁻ and forms a carbonyl. But I'm not clear on the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't directly from elimination but from some kind of rearrangement. For instance, a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of a carbocation, but I'm not sure how that would fit here.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the NMR data suggests. The product 1 has a singlet at 4.79 (2H). That's a sharp peak, so it's likely a CH₂ group without neighboring Hs, or in a symmetrical environment. Maybe an OCH₂ group, like in an ether or ester.

The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests several equivalent CH₂ groups in a ring, perhaps the adamantane structure remains, but with some substitution. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂ group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen or a carbonyl.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps its structure is such that the carbonyl is at a position that still allows the adamantane skeleton to be present. For example, perhaps the elimination leads to a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead carbon is connected to two CH₂ groups. If one of those CH₂ groups becomes a carbonyl, that would make it a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the base induces the elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, forming a carbonyl group. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

If you have two Brs on adjacent carbons, heating with KOH could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if the structure allows for another elimination, perhaps removing another HBr and forming a triple bond, but that doesn't create a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group via a neighboring group participation. For example, perhaps the base deprotonates, the Br leaves as a leaving group, and the adjacent carbon becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, but in a vicinal dihalide, you have two adjacent Brs. If one Br leaves as a result of elimination, you form a double bond. If the second Br leaves as well, perhaps via another elimination, you might get a triple bond. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a simple elimination but a substitution where a Br is replaced by an oxygen-containing group, like an alcohol. But then how do you get a carbonyl?

Hmm, perhaps I should let go of trying to figure out product 1 completely and proceed to see if the next steps can help. Let's see.

Product 1 is then heated with Al(OiPr)3 in excess to form product 2. Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but it can also be used in other acylation reactions or as a catalyst.

If product 1 is an alkene, perhaps it undergoes a dihydroxylation or some addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl compound that undergoes some kind of alkylation.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is an epoxide, then Al(OiPr)3 could catalyze its ring-opening. But without knowing what product 1 is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then Al(OiPr)3 might not do much unless it's involved in some Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but ketones aren't typical substrates for that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, and Al(OiPr)3 could induce some kind of rearrangement or alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al(OiPr)3 helps in forming an acetal or something else.

But without knowing product 1, it's challenging. Maybe I should focus on the ozonolysis step.

Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. If product 2 has a double bond, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

So, if product 3 is formed from ozonolysis, perhaps the coupling comes from adjacent carbonyl groups or from protons near carbonyls.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a simple alkene would give two carbonyl compounds. If the alkene is in a symmetrical position, the products would be similar or identical.

But let's think about the structure of product 2. If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me try to outline the possible structures:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (after KOH) → product 2 (after Al(OiPr)3) → product 3 (after ozonolysis).

If product 1 is an alkene (from elimination of two HBr), and product 2 is an alkene modified by Al(OiPr)3 (maybe a dihydroxylation or some addition), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, product 1 is an epoxide, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 becomes an alcohol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether, but then ozonolysis wouldn't apply.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then, when heated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, then with Al(OiPr)3, it might undergo ring-opening to form a diol. But then ozonolysis wouldn't be applicable.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think about what each step does.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming elimination, product 1 is an alkene. So structure would have a double bond where the two Brs were. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diamantadiene? Or maybe the double bond is elsewhere.

But then the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit. Unless the alkene is part of a conjugated system that can form a carbonyl upon some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If the elimination leads to the formation of an enol, which tautomerizes to a ketone. So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

If that's the case, then product 1's structure would have a carbonyl group. So, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ makes sense.

Now, the NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H, maybe OCH₂), 2.41-2.23 (10H, perhaps CH₂ groups in a ring), 1.94 (2H, perhaps another CH₂).

So, maybe product 1 is a ketone with an OCH₂ group attached.

Wait, but how would a ketone form from elimination of two HBr molecules? Maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, which under certain conditions could form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps a pinacol-like rearrangement occurs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a hydride shift and forming a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the elimination forms a cyclopropane ring, which upon ring-opening forms a ketone, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's say product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1,3-diketoadamantane or something similar. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it induces some kind of acylation.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and Al(OiPr)3 helps in forming an ether.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is a diol, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to the formation of an acetal or ketal. But then, ozonolysis wouldn't make sense unless there's a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was in product 2.

If product 3 has carbonyl groups, then in its NMR, any protons adjacent to carbonyls would be deshielded and appear downfield. These protons would also exhibit coupling with neighboring protons.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In such a scenario, the protons next to a carbonyl (like alpha protons) would typically be split by neighboring protons. For example, in a ketone, the alpha protons are next to the carbonyl and would couple with any adjacent Hs.

In a simple case, say, a ketone like acetone ( (CH3)2CO ), the alpha protons are on the CH3 groups. Each methyl group's protons couple with each other, leading to a singlet. But that's a simple case.

In a more complex structure, the coupling could be more intricate. For example, in a cyclic ketone, the alpha protons might be adjacent to other protons, leading to splitting.

Alternatively, if product 3 is a diketone, the protons adjacent to both ketones would be deshielded and perhaps coupled with each other and other nearby protons.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. So product 2 must have a double bond that, when cleaved, forms carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, say, between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would break this into two carbonyl groups, so product 3 would have two carbonyls in place of the double bond.

Now, the structure of product 2 would influence the structure of product 3. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or an acetal, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is a dihydroxy derivative, but then ozonolysis wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an alkene with substituents that, upon ozonolysis, produce specific products.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene, which upon ozonolysis would break into two or more carbonyl groups.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's challenging to pin this down.

Let me think about the coupling pattern options given. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

These splitting patterns suggest that a proton is coupled to two or three other protons. For example, a triplet means coupling with two equivalent protons (n+1 rule, where n=2 gives triplet). A triplet of triplets would mean coupling with two sets of protons, each causing triplet splitting.

In product 3, the most deshielded proton would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The adjacent protons could be in a certain configuration that leads to a specific coupling pattern.

For example, if the proton is next to a CH2 group, which in turn is next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex. Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to a CH group that is next to another CH, the coupling could result in a triplet of triplets or similar.

Wait, another angle: Ozonolysis of a diene (product 2) would produce two carbonyl groups. The structure of product 3 might have a diketone, perhaps in a symmetrical position.

If the carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons, the alpha protons would be on adjacent carbons as well. So each alpha proton would be next to two other protons. Let's say each alpha position has two protons. Then, each proton would couple with two neighboring protons, perhaps leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the options suggest more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the alpha protons are each coupled with two other sets of protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each alpha proton is next to a CH2 group and another CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of these CH2 protons is coupled with two other protons on the same group (geminal coupling, but that's usually negligible) and also with protons on adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, if the structure after ozonolysis leads to a situation where a proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons, each causing a split, the overall pattern could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to two protons on one side and one on the other, or some other combination, the pattern could vary.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH is next to two different CH2 groups. Each of those CH2 groups would have two protons, leading to n=2 and n=2, so (2+1)*(2+1)=9 peaks, a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is next to a CH2 group and another CH group. The CH2 would split into a triplet, and the CH into a doublet, leading to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: The proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons (say, a CH2 group), leading to a triplet. But if it's also adjacent to another set of equivalent protons (like another CH2), the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, let's think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2(CO)R. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be split by the neighboring CH2 protons.

So, for each CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons would couple with the two protons on the same CH2 (but usually geminal coupling is negligible) and with the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

If the adjacent CH2 is a single group, then each proton would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent group is another CH2, each proton would see two protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, each proton would be a triplet. However, if the adjacent group is a CH with two protons, then perhaps it's different.

Alternatively, imagine a structure where the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of these CH2 protons is also adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each proton would couple with two protons from the same CH2 (but same group, so maybe not) and two from the adjacent CH2. But same as before, leading to a triplet.

But the options don't include a triplet as the correct answer unless it's option A.

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), and pentet (D). So perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons. For example, it's next to a CH2 and a CH group. Each of these would cause splitting, leading to a doublet of triplets or triplet of doublets.

Alternatively, if it's next to two different CH2 groups, each causing a triplet split, the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let's think about a possible structure.

Suppose product 3 is a diketone derived from ozonolysis. The structure might be something like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO=O. But that's just a guess.

Wait, no, more likely, the ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, if product 2 is an alkene, say, CH2=CH-..., ozonolysis would form two carbonyls.

Wait, but given the starting material is adamantane derivatives, the product would likely retain part of the adamantane structure.

Another possibility: product 2 is an alkene in a bridge position of adamantane. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, forming two carbonyl groups.

For example, if product 2 is 1,3-diamantadiene, ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyls, forming 1,3-diketoadamantane or something similar.

In such a case, the structure would have two ketone groups. The protons adjacent to these ketones would be the alpha protons, which are on the same carbon as the ketone.

In a simple diketone, the alpha protons would be on adjacent carbons to each ketone. Each of these alpha protons would couple with the other alpha protons.

Wait, for example, if the structure is (CH2)CO-CH2-CO(CH2), then each CH2 group next to the ketone would have protons that couple with each other.

So, each CH2 adjacent to a ketone would have two protons. The protons on each CH2 would couple with the two protons on the same CH2 and the two on the adjacent CH2. But considering that the adjacent CH2 is next to another ketone, those protons would be deshielded as well.

Wait, but this is getting too vague. Let me think about the coupling in such a scenario.

Suppose each alpha CH2 has two protons. Each proton on a CH2 would be split by the two protons on the same CH2 (but geminal coupling is usually very small and may not be observed) and by the two protons on the adjacent CH2 (which would be vicinal coupling).

So, each proton would see two neighboring protons from the adjacent CH2 group. According to the n+1 rule, each would split into a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But if each proton is also coupled with another set of protons, like from another group, the splitting could become more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each alpha CH2 is next to another CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another approach: The most deshielded proton is adjacent to a carbonyl, let's say it's part of a CH2 group next to a ketone. The two protons on this CH2 will couple with each other (but likely as a singlet if they're equivalent) and with the protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

If the adjacent group is a CH2, each proton on the first CH2 would see two protons from the adjacent group, leading to a triplet. So each would be a triplet.

But considering that the two groups are symmetrical, perhaps the splitting is a triplet.

But the options don't include triplet as the correct answer unless option A is correct. However, the options also include more complex patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is adjacent to two different sets of neighboring protons. For example, one neighboring CH2 and another neighboring CH group.

If the proton is adjacent to a CH2 (two protons) and a CH (one proton), then the coupling would be triplet (from CH2) and doublet (from CH), leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But in the options, B is triplet of triplets and C is doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be triplet from each, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, if a proton is coupled with two different sets of two protons each, it would split into (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which isn't an option. But the options don't have a nonet, so perhaps it's a simpler case.

Wait, another possibility: The proton is adjacent to a single neighboring proton. For example, if it's part of a CH group next to another CH group with one proton. Then, each proton would be a doublet. But that doesn't fit the options either.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

A pentet would mean the proton is coupled with four equivalent protons (n=4 → pentet). That would happen if, for example, the proton is next to a CH2CH2 group, so four equivalent protons. But I don't see that in the current scenario.

A triplet of triplets would imply coupling with two sets of two protons each. For example, if the proton is next to two different CH2 groups, each with two protons. Each coupling would split into triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

A doublet of triplets would mean the proton is coupled with two protons (causing a triplet) and another set of two protons (causing another triplet), but the overall pattern would be a doublet of triplets, which is less likely.

Alternatively, if the proton is coupled with three equivalent protons, it would be a quartet. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each of these protons is next to another CH2 group, which has two protons. So each proton in the first CH2 would couple with the two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Additionally, if there's another coupling, perhaps from a neighboring group, it could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a bridge where the proton is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each contributing two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. However, based on the options, the most plausible answer seems to be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (1) is formed, which exhibits a characteristic IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction involves elimination and possibly rearrangement to form a ketone or a similar carbonyl-containing compound. The NMR data for product 1 supports this interpretation, with signals consistent with a carbonyl group and an adamantane-like structure.

In the next step, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a strong Lewis acid. This step likely modifies the structure of product 1, potentially forming a compound (product 2) with a double bond, as ozonolysis is performed in the subsequent step. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, and the final product (3) is derived from this reaction.

The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby protons. The coupling pattern arises from interactions with neighboring protons. 

Considering the splitting patterns provided in the options:
- **Triplet (A):** Occurs when a proton is coupled to two equivalent protons.
- **Triplet of triplets (B):** Results from coupling with two distinct sets of two equivalent protons.
- **Doublet of triplets (C):** Arises from coupling with two protons (causing a triplet) and another set of protons (causing a doublet).
- **Pentet (D):** Requires coupling with four equivalent protons.

Given the structure of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to two different sets of protons, such as two CH₂ groups, leading to a triplet of triplets. This pattern is consistent with the splitting caused by two distinct coupling interactions.

Answer: B
