Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A, B, C, D with different vectors. 

Wait, what's a density matrix again? Oh right, a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But here, ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That looks like a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. So it's a maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the qubits space... When we talk about the geometrical position, I'm thinking about how this density matrix is represented in some coordinate system. Hmm, I remember that for single qubit density matrices, they can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector represents the state on the Bloch sphere.

The general form of a single qubit density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (a, b, c) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So the density matrix ρ can be written as [I + (aσ_x + bσ_y + cσ_z)] / 2.

Let me write the given ρ. Expanding |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

Wait, so ρ is the identity matrix divided by 2. Let me write that out. I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Comparing this to the general form, (I + r·σ)/2. If I set this equal to the given ρ, then (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero matrix. Because I/2 + (r·σ)/2 = I/2, so (r·σ) must be zero.

Wait, the only way r·σ is zero is if r is zero. Because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices and their linear combination would only be zero if all coefficients are zero. So r = (0,0,0).

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. But wait, isn't that the completely mixed state? Yeah, because a qubit in the maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin. So the density matrix is (I/2), which corresponds to the point (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer.

I think that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubits space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. A single qubit density matrix can generally be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (a, b, c) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \( \rho \), we see that \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). The only solution to this is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
