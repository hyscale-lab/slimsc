Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about a researcher trying to create a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses the GADD45G protein. They inserted a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but they're not seeing the overexpression as expected.

The plus strand sequence provided is a long DNA sequence. The problem must be in that sequence, causing the protein not to be expressed properly. Let's look at the options and see which one fits.

The options are A to D. Let's go through each.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus. If there's a mutation in the HA sequence, the tag might not be present, affecting purification. But the question says the construct was modified to add HA. If the HA sequence is wrong, antibodies might not bind, making affinity purification fail. But the researcher is using the construct to test expression, so maybe they're not getting any protein because the HA is missing, leading to inability to detect it. But I'm not sure if this is the main issue here. Let me think more.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. Ribosomes read the mRNA until they hit a stop codon. If the DNA construct has an early stop codon, the mRNA would terminate early. Looking at the DNA sequence, I need to find if there's a stop codon (TAG, TGA, or TAA) earlier than expected, which would cause truncation. Let me scan the sequence for those triplets.

Wait, the DNA is the coding (plus) strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this. So to find the stop codons, I need to look for the reverse complement sequences in the mRNA. Alternatively, for the coding sequence, the mRNA is same as the plus strand except T becomes U.

So looking for in the mRNA sequence any of the stop codons.

Looking through the sequence:

The first part is ATG, which is start (Met). Let me look through for TAG, TGA, TAA sequences.

Looking at the DNA:

Looking for the sequences that would code for stop codons in mRNA. Since DNA is plus strand, the mRNA is similar except Tâ†’U.

So, mRNA would have UAG, UGA, UAA as stops.

Looking for these in the mRNA. Let's go through the sequence.

Let's read in triplets:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CCG GAA AGC AAG GCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC... Hmm, wait here: TGA is at positions where? Let me check.

Wait, the first part of the DNA is 5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, in the DNA sequence, I see 'TGA' in the middle. Let me look for where. Let's go line by line.

Looking for TGA in the DNA, but the DNA is the coding (sense) strand. So the mRNA will have UGA, which is a stop codon. So if the DNA has TGA in the coding sequence, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon, causing premature termination.

Looking at the sequence:

Wait, here's a part: ...AAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Wait, I see 'TGA' in the DNA sequence right before 'CTTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Wait, looking at the part: ...AAAGTCTTGAACGTGGA... So the DNA has TGA here. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate at this point, producing a truncated protein.

This would prevent the full-length protein from being expressed. So the researcher is seeing no overexpression because the protein is being cut short.

So why is this happening? The construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. If the HA is correctly added, but the GADD45G coding has a premature stop, the protein would be shorter than expected. So the issue is an early stop codon in the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would be due to a stop codon in the mRNA. So that's option B.

Another thought: Could it be option D, a missing tRNA for UAA? Well, the stop codon here is UGA, not UAA. So D is about UAA, which isn't present in the mRNA, so D isn't the problem.

Option C: The lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag isn't present, the protein might be recognized and degraded. But the problem is that the HA tag is part of the coding sequence. If the construct is correct, the HA should be at the start. But in the DNA, the HA might not be present, or perhaps the construct was not correctly inserted. Wait, but the sequence does start with ATG, which is the start codon. The HA tag is added before the GADD45G coding sequence. Let me see: the question says the HA is at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. But in the given DNA sequence, the start is ATG, which is the start of GADD45G. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the HA wasn't correctly incorporated.

Wait, looking at the sequence, the first part is ATG TAC C... So the start codon is ATG, but the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the plasmid should have the HA tag coding sequence followed by the GADD45G. But looking at the given DNA sequence, the first part is ATG, which is the start of GADD45G, not the HA. That suggests perhaps the HA wasn't added correctly, so the HA is missing, and the start is just the GADD45G. But that would mean the HA wasn't inserted, so when they try to purify using HA antibodies, they wouldn't find the protein. But the question states that the researcher is unable to overexpress the protein. So perhaps the problem is that the HA tag isn't present because the construct is wrong. But the options don't directly address that. Alternatively, the problem could be that the HA tag is inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift and a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the construct should have the HA tag coding sequence followed by GADD45G coding. But looking at the given DNA, the first codon is ATG, which would be the start of GADD45G. So the HA tag isn't present. That would mean that the construct has the HA tag missing. So the HA wasn't added, so when they overexpress, the protein doesn't have the HA tag. Then, when they try to purify using HA antibodies, they wouldn't get any protein, thinking it's not expressed. But in this case, the problem is that the HA tag isn't present, not that the protein isn't made. But in the question, the issue is that they can't overexpress the protein as expected. Maybe the HA tag isn't present, but the GADD45G is expressed. So why would that cause lack of expression? Unless the HA tag was needed for the function of the protein, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag addition caused a frameshift, inserting a stop codon. Let me check again.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, typically 11 amino acids. Its DNA sequence would be a short addition before the GADD45G. If the HA wasn't added correctly, the initial ATG would start GADD45G, but perhaps the HA was inserted in a way that caused a frameshift. Alternatively, perhaps the HA's DNA sequence had a stop codon, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence, perhaps the construct doesn't include the HA tag. Because the first part is ATG TAC C..., which is the start of GADD45G without the HA. So the HA wasn't inserted. Therefore, when they express the construct, the protein is just GADD45G, without HA. But why would this cause no expression? Unless the HA tag is required for the expression or for the function of the protein. But I think the main issue here is that the construct lacks the HA, but that doesn't necessarily prevent the expression of GADD45G.

Wait, but the issue is that the researcher is unable to overexpress the protein. So perhaps the HA tag is necessary for the correct folding or function, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was supposed to be a part of the expression vector but wasn't added, leading to no expression. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the HA tag is part of a signal peptide or a solubility enhancer. If it's not present, the protein might not be expressed properly, perhaps leading to aggregation or degradation. But I think the main problem in the sequence is the premature stop codon. Because in the mRNA, the UGA occurs early, leading to a truncated protein.

So if the mRNA has UGA as a stop codon, the protein won't be full-length. So the issue is that the construct has a premature stop codon, leading to early termination.

Looking back at the options:

A) Missense mutation in HA: If the HA sequence is wrong, the HA epitope is absent, but the GADD45G is present. So the protein is expressed but can't be purified. But the problem is overexpression not happening, so maybe the HA was crucial for expression, but I don't think so. Alternatively, the HA could be in a frame that causes a stop.

B) Ribosome terminated early: Yes, because there's a stop codon in the mRNA, leading to a truncated protein.

C) Lack of linker leading to proteolysis: If there's no linker, maybe the protein is getting degraded. But without knowing if the protein is being made, it's hard to say. If the protein isn't made because of a stop codon, then C isn't the issue.

D) No tRNA for UAA: The stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA, so this doesn't apply.

So the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early because the mRNA has a stop codon (UGA) in the coding sequence, leading to a truncated protein. Therefore, the overexpression isn't achieved because the protein isn't made in full length.


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model to study the role of GADD45G in SARS-CoV-2 infection by overexpressing the protein with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. However, the overexpression is not occurring as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the mRNA contains a premature stop codon (UGA) within the coding sequence for GADD45G. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in the production of a truncated, non-functional protein. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA sequence would affect the HA tag's integrity, potentially hindering purification. However, the issue here is the lack of full-length protein expression, which is more directly caused by the premature stop codon rather than the HA tag's integrity.
- **Option B**: The presence of the UGA stop codon in the mRNA leads to premature termination of translation, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. This aligns with the observed lack of overexpression.
- **Option C**: A lack of linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but the primary issue is the absence of full-length protein due to the premature stop codon, making this option less relevant.
- **Option D**: The tRNA for UAA does not exist in the mouse, but the stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA, so this option does not apply.

The most plausible explanation for the lack of overexpression is the premature stop codon (UGA) in the mRNA, causing early termination of translation. 

Answer: B
