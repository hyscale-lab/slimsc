Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. The options are a to d, and the choices are A to D.

Wait, the options a to d are the exoplanets, and the answers A to D correspond to them. So each option (a-d) is a different planet, and the choices are which one is correct.

Let me read the question again. The question is about density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, higher density means more mass in a given volume.

Looking at each option:

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So mass is same as Earth, radius is same. Density would be same as Earth, which is about 5.5 g/cm続.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density about 5.5 g/cm続. Wait, but the density is given. So if the density is 5.5, same as Earth, but it's more massive. So how does that affect the radius? Well, density is mass/volume. Volume depends on radius cubed. So if mass is double and density same, volume must be double. So radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. But the question is about density, so this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth. Because density is determined by composition. If it's same as Earth, density is same. So Earth's is 5.5, so this planet has 5.5 g/cm続 density.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, half the mass. Same composition, so same density. So 5.5 g/cm続.

Wait, but looking at the options, a has same mass and radius as Earth, so same density. So all options except b have same density as Earth except perhaps b, which has 5.5 as well. So in that case, looking for the highest density, all have same except maybe something else.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The question is which has the highest density. If all except one have same density, but maybe one has higher.

Wait, let's reevaluate each option.

Option a: Earth-like, so density 5.5.

Option b: mass
