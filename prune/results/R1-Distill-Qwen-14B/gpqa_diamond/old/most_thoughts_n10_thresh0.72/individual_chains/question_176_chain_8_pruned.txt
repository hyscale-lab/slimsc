Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to it, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a second—that doesn't look like a unit vector. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized, right? The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me calculate that. (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. So maybe I need to normalize it first before proceeding. Because probabilities depend on the norm.

Right, the state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To normalize it, I'll divide each component by the square root of 6 (since 6 is the sum of squares). So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let me write that out:

ψ = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the problem is about measuring observables P and Q. The measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. And we need the probability that P is 0 and Q is -1.

So, for each observable, I think I need to find the possible outcomes and their corresponding eigenvectors. Then, the process would be: measuring P first, then Q, and finding the combined probability.

Wait, but wait—when you measure P first, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when you measure Q, it's on that new state. So the joint probability is the probability of getting P=0 multiplied by the probability of getting Q=-1 given that P was 0. Or maybe it's more accurate to find the state after measuring P, then compute the probability for Q on that state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the state after measuring P=0, and then compute the probability of Q=-1 in that state.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should do it that way. Let me think again. The combined measurement of P=0 and Q=-1 would require that after measuring P=0, the state is projected into the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, from there, the probability of measuring Q=-1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the square modulus of the component of the original state in the joint eigenspace of P=0 and Q=-1. But I'm not certain. Maybe it's better to approach each step separately.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.

Operator P's matrix is given as:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, I should write that out properly. So:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I'll need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

But that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe I can find if there's any symmetry or obvious eigenvectors.

Looking at P, perhaps there are eigenvectors where the state is symmetric or antisymmetric in a certain way.

Wait, another approach: since the matrix is symmetric, it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just compute the eigenvalues numerically.

The matrix P:

Row 1: [0, a, 0], where
