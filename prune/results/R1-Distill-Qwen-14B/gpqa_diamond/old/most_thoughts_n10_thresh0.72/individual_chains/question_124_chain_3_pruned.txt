Okay, so I've just come across this physics problem, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, the problem involves particles colliding at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new type, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. Now, on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, maybe time dilation is the key here.

Wait, the particles are produced at the center of the detector. So the detector is a sphere with radius 30 meters. If the particles are moving outward from the center, the distance they need to cover to reach the inner walls is 30 meters. But wait, the problem says that one third reach the inner walls. That suggests that some of them decay before they get there.

Oh, right, the particles are fast-decaying. So their lifetime is such that only a fraction have enough time to reach the detector walls. The faster they go, the longer their lifetime from our (lab frame) perspective, so more of them would reach the walls.

Wait, but wait, the particles are moving at a certain speed. Their lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau), right? So the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in their rest frame. From the lab frame, it's longer by gamma.

So the particles will travel a certain distance before decaying. The distance they can travel before decaying is velocity multiplied by their lifetime. So the maximum distance D is v * gamma tau.

Wait, but v is the velocity. Since they are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately equal to the speed of light, c. So D â‰ˆ c * gamma tau.

But wait, let me think again. The decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle hasn't
