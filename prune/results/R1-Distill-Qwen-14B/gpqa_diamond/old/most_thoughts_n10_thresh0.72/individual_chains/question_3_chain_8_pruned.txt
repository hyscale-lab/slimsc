Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ plus sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the sigma_z operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on particles in the given state. To find this, I need to calculate the expectation value for each part of the operator and then sum them up.

Wait, but the operator is 10σ_z plus 5σ_x. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩. Plus, because expectation is linear, that's correct.

So first, I'll need to compute ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ separately for the given state.

Let me write down the state again: ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me note that the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Wait, but wait, I should check normalization. The sum of squares of the coefficients should be 1, right?

0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. 0.25 +0.75 is 1, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, σ_z is the Pauli z-matrix, right? Its eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩ because |↑⟩ is the +eigenstate and |↓⟩ is the -eigenstate.

So for σ_z, the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is just the probability of measuring +1 times 1 plus the probability of measuring -1 times (-1). Because when you measure σ_z, you get +1 if the state is |↑⟩ and -1 if it's |↓⟩.

So the probability for |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, so 25% chance of +1. The probability for |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = (3/4) = 0.75, so 75% chance of -1.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Got that part.

Next, I need to find ⟨σ_x⟩. Oh, σ_x is the Pauli x-matrix, which is a bit trickier. The eigenstates of σ_x are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σ_z. So I can't directly say that the expectation value is as straightforward as with σ_z.

Wait,
