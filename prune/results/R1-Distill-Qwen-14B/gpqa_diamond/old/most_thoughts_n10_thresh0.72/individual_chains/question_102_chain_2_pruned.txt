Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically involving transgenic constructs and protein expression. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which means it has two genes under a single promoter, right? The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, how does that work? Oh, bicistronic vectors often use internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) so that two separate proteins can be expressed from a single mRNA. So the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element.

Looking at the vector structure: The ligand has a stop cassette with loxP. So the ligand is followed by a stop, and then the receptor comes after the IRES? Oh wait, the ligand is first, followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor is at the 3' end with its own stop in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, it would recombine and remove the stops, allowing the expression of both ligand and receptor.

Wait, but how does the expression work? The CBA promoter drives the transcription of both ligand and receptor. The mRNA would have the ligand ORF, then the stop with loxP. Then the IRES would allow the ribosome to translate the receptor, right? Because IRES allows for internal initiation. So if the Cre is present, the loxP stops are removed, so both ligand and receptor are expressed.

But in the question, the researcher used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested them on Western blot. They saw a signal proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed. So the construct is working in the primary astrocyte culture.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells. The offspring were born, and they visualized them under a fluorescence confocal microscope. They didn't see a green signal. Wait, eGFP is green, so why isn't it showing up?

The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells. So if the ligand is produced by one cell and the receptor by another, they wouldn't both be expressed in the same cells. But wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand and receptor should be co-expressed in the same cells if the construct is working. But in this case, the construct is under the control of SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells
