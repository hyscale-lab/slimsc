Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Okay, let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance.

Wait, but how exactly? Parallax is in arcseconds, right. The formula I remember is that the distance in parsecs (d) is 1 divided by the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. So, plx = 1/d. That makes sense.

So, the problem says N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d. Because plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d. Wait, no, plx is 1/d. So plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/(d^5). So 1/(plx^5) would be d^5.

So N ∝ d^5. That means as distance d increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of d. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, the question is asking for the change in the number of stars per unit distance. So, maybe it's the derivative of N with respect to d?

Alternatively, considering that N ∝ d^5, and the question is about how N changes with distance. So, for a small change in r (distance), what's the change in N.

Wait, let's think about it in terms of differential. If N = k * d^5, where k is a constant, then the change in N (dN) when distance changes by dr is dN = 5k d^4 dr. So, dN/dr = 5k d^4. That suggests that the rate at which the number of stars increases with distance is proportional to d^4. But looking at the options, the choices are about how it varies with r, not as a derivative. Alternatively, the question might be about the number per unit distance, like the number density.

Wait
