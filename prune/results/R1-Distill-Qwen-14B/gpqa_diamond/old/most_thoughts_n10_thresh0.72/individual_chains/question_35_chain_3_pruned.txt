Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon, specifically looking at the Y-component, which is represented by the operator Ay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my angular momentum stuff, but let's try to work through this.

The problem says that Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, let's write that out.

So, S matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, Ay = c * S, so substituting c = h/(4π), we get:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S
So, the matrix becomes:
[ 0        -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0       ]

Wait, no, wait: because S is multiplied by c. So, each element of S is multiplied by c. So, the matrix Ay would be:

Top row: 0 and -i*(h/(4π))
Bottom row: i*(h/(4π)) and 0.

So, the matrix Ay is:

[ 0            (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    0           ]

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The problem gives four options, and I need to find which statement is correct.

Wait, wait. I remember that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So, let's set up the matrix Ay - λ I.

Ay - λ I:
[ -λ          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ         ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

So, determinant = λ² - [ ( -i * i ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, since it's ( (-i h/(4π)) ) * ( (i h)/(4π) ), that's [ (-i)(i) ] * (h²)/(16π²).

What's (-i)(i)? Let's compute that: -i * i = -i² = -( -1 ) = 1.

So, the determinant becomes λ² - [ (1) * h²/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So, λ² = h²/(16 π² )

Taking square roots: λ = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait, because h is Planck's constant? Oh wait, in the question, c is h/(4π), right? So h is in terms of that.

So, the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait, that's the eigenvalues for Ay. So the eigenvalues are real and imaginary? Or are they real?

Wait, wait. Wait, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix with real entries? Wait no, because in the matrix
