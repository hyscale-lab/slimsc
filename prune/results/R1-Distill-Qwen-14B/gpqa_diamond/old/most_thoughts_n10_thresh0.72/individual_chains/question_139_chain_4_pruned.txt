Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds react with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, they form diketones. The question is about finding the right starting materials A and B that would produce the given diketones after this treatment.

Let me think. Oh wait, I think this has something to do with the formation of diketones via the Lossen rearrangement or maybe some kind of elimination followed by keto-enol tautomerism. Oh wait, no, another possibility is that this is the Beckmann rearrangement, but that usually involves oximes. Or wait, maybe it's about the formation of nitro compounds leading to elimination.

Wait, another angle: the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that the typical conditions for the formation of diazonium salts, especially from aromatic amines? But wait, the products here are diketones, which are carbonyl compounds. So maybe it's about how amines can lead to carbonyl groups.

Wait a second, I think I'm mixing things up. Let's think again. Diazonium salts are usually formed from aromatic amines, but in this case, the starting materials might be aliphatic amines. But wait, aliphatic amines under these conditions might not form stable diazonium salts. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach. The reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh! I think this
