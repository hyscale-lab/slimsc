Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n must have components (nx, 0, nz), right? Because it's in the x-z plane, ny is zero.

Wait, the operator components are given for Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

The operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator along direction n would be the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction components. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So n_x and n_z are the direction cosines, which satisfy n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me denote θ as the angle that the direction vector makes with the z-axis. Then, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Because in the x-z plane, when θ=0, we’re along z, θ=90 along x. So, yes, that makes sense.

So substituting, P becomes:

P = (sinθ)(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So combining the matrices:

The (1,1) element is cosθ*(1), since the first matrix for Px has zero in (1,1), and the second matrix (Pz) has cosθ.

The (1,2) element is sinθ*(1), because in the first matrix, it's 1 there, and the second matrix has zero.

Similarly, the (2,1) element is sinθ*(1) because the first matrix (Px) has 1, and the second (Pz) has 0.

The (2,2) element is cosθ*(-1) because the second matrix contributes -1* cosθ.

So the matrix for P is (ħ/2) multiplied by:

[ cosθ   sinθ ]
[ sinθ  -cosθ ]

Wait, no, wait: Let me recheck. Because the first matrix for P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by sinθ, it becomes sinθ*(0,1;1,0). The second matrix for Pz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when multiplied by cosθ, it becomes cosθ*(1,0;0,-1). So adding these gives:

[ cosθ, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]

Yes, that's correct. So P is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Because Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when multiplied by cosθ, it's cosθ*(1,0;0,-1). So the diagonal elements are cosθ and -cosθ. Then, adding the Px part, which for the (1,2) and (2,1) elements is sinθ*(1 and 1). So the matrix becomes:

[ cosθ, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]

Wait, no, the (2,2) element is from Pz, which is -cosθ? So yes, I think that's correct.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ
