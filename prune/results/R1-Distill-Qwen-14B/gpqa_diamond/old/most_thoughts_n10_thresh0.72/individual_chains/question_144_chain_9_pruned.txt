Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about meson resonance and the mean decay distance. Hmm. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The mean decay distance probably has to do with how far the meson travels before it decays.

The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Oh wait, units are in GeV and MeV. I need to make sure to convert them properly, maybe to meters or seconds.

Wait, mean decay distance. I think the formula for the mean proper lifetime (which is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is something like τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the decay width, which is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the width Γ is the total decay rate, so the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. Then, once I have the lifetime, I can find out how far the particle travels before decaying, which would be the mean decay distance.

But wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds. Oh right, because the particle is moving at a high speed, the lifetime we measure in the lab frame (the mean decay distance) is longer than τ due to time dilation. So I'll need to calculate the
