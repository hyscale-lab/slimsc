Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, so first I need to figure out what nucleus X is.

Li usually has 3 protons because it's lithium. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because Li normally has an atomic number of 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which is a charged particle with charge +3e, I think. Wait, no, Li has 3 protons, so if it's a nucleus with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, it might be Li-6. But wait, the charge would be +3 since each proton is +e. So, perhaps it's a +3 charge.

But wait, in colliders, they usually refer to ions by their mass number. So, the Li-6 nucleus has a mass number A = 6. So, the mass of the nucleus is approximately the mass of 6 nucleons. Each nucleon is roughly a proton or neutron with similar mass. I remember the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me calculate that.

6 * 938 is 5628 MeV/c², which is 5.628 GeV/c². So the mass of the ion is 5.628 GeV/c². Okay.

The problem is about finding the energy when the speed is 0.96c. I think this is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, let me think. In relativity, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m c²). Oh wait, since E = gamma m c², right? Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So I need to find gamma when v is 0.96c. Let me compute that. Let me remember the formula for gamma. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (
