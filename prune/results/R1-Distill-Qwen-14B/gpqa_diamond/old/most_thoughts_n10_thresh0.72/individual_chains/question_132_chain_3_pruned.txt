Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. I remember that NMR can tell us a lot about the structure of a compound, especially the aromatic region which is around 7 ppm, but wait, the question says the signals are around 6.7 ppm. Hmm, that's lower than typical aromatic protons. Maybe they're deshielded or perhaps they're in a conjugated system, or maybe substituted in a way that shifts the peaks downfield less.

The compound has a molecular formula C10H14, which is a bit unusual. Wait, benzene rings with substituents. Let me think: C10H14 can be thought of as two benzene rings each with some methyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a single benzene ring with multiple substituents. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14: the formula is CnHm. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m)/2. So n=10, m=14: (22-14)/2=4. So each benzene ring contributes 4 (since benzene is 3 double bonds or one ring plus three double bonds). So perhaps two benzene rings? Or four substituents on a single ring. Wait, if it's a single benzene ring, four substituents would account for the four degrees
