Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem gives a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it goes through several reaction steps, and finally, I need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, product 4.

Hmm. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So the norbornene derivative has a substituent at position 7, which is the bridgehead. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group, O-t-Bu. So the structure is a norbornene with an oxygen attached to a tert-butyl group.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, the reagents are 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. Oh, I think this is an example of a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting material is a diene (norbornene) and the other compound is a dienophile. But wait, the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, but with substituents at 5 and 6 positions. Each of these substituents is a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is CH2Br2, I think. Wait, no, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? Or maybe each substituent is BrCH2- attached to the cyclohexene.

Wait, the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene: the cyclohexene has double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions, so positions 5 and 6 are adjacent. Each of these positions has a CH2Br2 group? Or maybe it's more like each substituent is CH2Br attached. Wait, the formula is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl). So each substituent is a methyl group with two bromines attached. So each substituent is CH2Br2? No, wait. Dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2, but each is a -CH2Br group? Wait, no, dibromo would imply two Br atoms on the same carbon. So each substituent is a CH2Br2 group. Hmm
