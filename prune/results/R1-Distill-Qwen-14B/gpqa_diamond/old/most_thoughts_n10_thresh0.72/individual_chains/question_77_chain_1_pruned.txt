Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts: reactions leading to products A and B. I need to figure out what each product is and then match them with the options.

First, looking at the first part of the reaction for product A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. That's a mouthful. Let me try to draw that structure mentally. So benzene ring connected to a CH2-O- group. And the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down.

The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is like this: 
CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2, but with a substituent. Wait, but the but-2-en-1-yl has a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 2 and 3, so actually, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that can't be. Oh wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, because the substituent is at position 1, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that's butyl. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH2CH2... Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(CH3) ?

Wait, the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me number it. The substituent is on carbon 3, so the group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4
So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 2 and 3. So the group is: CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, the substituent is methyl on carbon 3. So substituting a methyl on the third carbon of the butenyl group.

So the group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, because the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2, right? So substituting a methyl on the third carbon, which is CH2, so that would make the structure CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Wait, no, because the third carbon is CH2. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH2... No, let me think again. The group is but-2-en-
