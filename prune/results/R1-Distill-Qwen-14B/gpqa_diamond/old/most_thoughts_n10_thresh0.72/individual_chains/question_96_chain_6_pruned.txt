Okay, so I'm trying to solve this black hole entropy problem. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Something about the Bekenstein-Hawking formula? Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So to find the entropy, I need to find the area first.

The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon, which is 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. Wait, angular size θ is the apparent size from a distance, so I can use that to find the diameter of the event horizon. Oh, right! The formula relating angular size, actual size, and distance is θ ≈ (size)/(distance) when θ is small, which it is here because it's 1e-17 degrees.

But wait, θ is given in degrees, and I need to convert it into radians to use in the calculations. Because in physics formulas, we use radians. So how do I convert degrees to radians? Oh right, multiply by π/180. So θ (in radians) = 10^-17 degrees * (π/180) radians/degree. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, 10^-17 degrees is a very small angle. So the conversion would give θ ≈ 10^-17 * π/(180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. But for order of magnitude purposes, maybe I can approximate it as 1e-19 radians. But maybe I should be precise for the calculation.

So the size of the event horizon, let's call it D, would be approximately θ * d. But wait, θ is in radians, so D = θ * d. But wait, the distance d is given in parsecs. I need to convert that into meters because the formula for entropy uses SI units. Oh, right, 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So D = θ (in radians) * d. Let's compute that. So D ≈ (10^-17 * π/180) *
