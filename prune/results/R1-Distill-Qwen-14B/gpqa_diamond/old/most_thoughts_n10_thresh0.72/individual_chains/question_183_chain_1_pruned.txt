Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, index of hydrogen deficiency... I remember that's the same as the degree of unsaturation, right? It's a way to count the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group), and at position 5, a vinyl group (which is a CH2CH2 group, but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- maybe attached to the ring. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so if it's attached to the cyclohexene ring, that's a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the main ring is cyclohexene, so it already has one double bond. So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (since it's cyclohex-3-ene, so between carbons 3 and 4?), and substituents at positions 2 and 5.

So substituents are:

At position 2: formyl group (CHO)
At position 5: vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-; so the structure is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So the molecule has the ring itself with a double bond (cyclohexene), a formyl group, and a vinyl group. So the vinyl group has another double bond (since it's CH2=CH-).

So the initial molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl substituent. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation. Each double bond or ring adds one degree. So the cyclohexene ring is one, the vinyl group's double bond is another, and then the formyl group has a carbonyl (another double bond). So that's three double bonds in the molecule. So initial degrees of unsaturation are 3.

Wait, but wait. The formyl group is a CHO group, which is a carbonyl, so that's another double bond. So in the starting material, how many degrees are there?

The ring (cyclohexene) contributes 1 (since a cyclohexene is a 6-membered ring with one double bond, which is one degree). The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at position 5 is another double bond, that's 2. The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl, so another double bond, making 3. So initial degrees of unsaturation is 3.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I'm trying to remember what kind of reaction that is. Red phosphorus and HI... wait, I think that's the situation where the Wittig reaction is reversed or something else. Wait, no. Oh, right! It's the reaction where a carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group. Because I remember that when a carbonyl (like in an aldehyde or ketone) is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a reaction called the hydroiodination or maybe a reduction? Wait, no, more specifically, it's the Clemmensen reduction or the Wolff-Kishner? Wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 and heat, also for ketones. But this is red phosphorus and HI.

Oh wait! That's the method for reducing a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde or ketone) to a methylene group (CH2). So maybe the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2OH? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, another thought: when a carbonyl is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to do a substitution or addition reaction. Alternatively, I think it's the use of HI for deprotonation and then the red phosphorus for the reaction.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing this up. Another approach: HI is a strong acid. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. Oh, right! When a carbonyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus, the carbonyl is converted into a methylene group. For example, an aldehyde (RCHO) would become RCH2I, but wait, no, maybe RCH2 something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydroboration or another addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Let me think differently. Another approach: Red phosphorus and excess HI is a reagent used for the elimination reaction, or maybe for the dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps for the substitution.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the reaction where a carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group via a substitution. Wait, I think that when a carbonyl is treated with HI and red phosphorus, the oxygen is replaced by iodide. So for example, a ketone R2CO would become R2CH2I? Wait, no, maybe it's R2CH2I doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a replacement of the carbonyl oxygen with iodide, so
