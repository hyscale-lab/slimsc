Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my accelerator physics, but let's try to think through this.

The question is asking how many revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 is 190 kV.

Wait, what's a synchrocyclotron exactly? I remember that cyclotrons use a magnetic field to bend the particles, and they're accelerated by an electric field. But synchrocyclotrons are a type where the frequency of the electric field is adjusted so that the particles are always in phase with the field as they speed up. Right, because as the particles gain energy, their mass increases (relativistic effects), so the frequency of their orbit decreases. The synchrocyclotron's frequency adjustment compensates for that.

So, the key here is that the proton is accelerated in each revolution. Each time it goes around, it gets a little kick from the electric field. Since the voltage is alternating, it's like a time-varying electric field that provides energy to the proton each time it passes through.

The voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(2πν(α)t + Φ0). But wait, what is ν(α) here? I think in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating field is adjusted as the particle's momentum increases. The function ν(α) probably depends on the particle's velocity or something. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe we don't need to get into the exact dependence. Instead, we might need to relate the kinetic energy gain with the number of revolutions.

So, the proton starts with T ≈ 0 and ends up with T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage is 190 kV, which I think is the peak voltage of the accelerating field. Each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains energy. But wait, the voltage is sinusoidal, so the maximum energy transfer per revolution is U0. But wait,
