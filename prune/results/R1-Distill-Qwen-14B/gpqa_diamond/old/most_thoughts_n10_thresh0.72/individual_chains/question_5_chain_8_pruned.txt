Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by really understanding what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The problem provides the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so P is a vector operator, right? So it's like P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, but each component is scaled by ħ/2. Or wait, no, each component is given as ħ/2 times their respective matrices. Oh, right, because each component is multiplied by ħ/2.

So first, I need to recall that in quantum mechanics, the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon) are given by S_x, S_y, S_z, each of which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, respectively. So in this case, the operator P seems to be analogous to the spin operator, perhaps the spin component along some direction.

But wait, the question says the operator is for a muon, which is a lepton with spin ½, so that makes sense. So P must be like the spin operator in some direction.

The direction is arbitrary and lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane. But wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so n can be any direction in that plane, which implies that the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ would be 0 since it's in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since it's a unit vector, yeah, that's correct.

But how does this relate to the operator? Well, the operator P is along the direction n, so the operator would be
