Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The answer options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So for this problem, O is 10σz +5σx. 

First, maybe I should break this down into parts. The expectation value can be split into the sum of the expectation values of each term. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes sense because expectation values are linear.

So I'll calculate each part separately. Let's start with ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, it might be easier to compute.

The state |ψ⟩ is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's write that as a column vector. Since σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, more accurately, the expectation value of σz is the probability of measuring spin-up times +1 plus the probability of spin-down times -1. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Squaring them gives the probabilities.

So the probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2=0.25. The probability for |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4)=0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because |↑⟩ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue +1, so when measured, it would contribute +1 times the probability. Similarly, |↓⟩ has eigenvalue -1. So yes, 0.25 * 1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's correct.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.0. 

Now the second part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I can't directly use the same approach as σz. I think I need to compute it using the expectation value formula.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]. The state |ψ⟩ is a column vector. Let me write |ψ⟩ as a vector. 

|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Because for spin-1/2 particles, |↑⟩ is [1;0], |↓⟩ is [0;1], so 0.5|↑⟩ would be [0.5, 0], and sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ is [0, sqrt(3)/2], so adding them gives [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, wait a minute, no. Wait, actually, when I write it as a column
