Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question states that the crystal has an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distance... Oh right, in a crystal structure, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms. But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a special case where all edges are equal (like a cube but with all angles equal but not 90 degrees). So in this case, the lattice parameter 'a' is the same as the interatomic distance, right? Because it's a primitive unit cell. So a = 10 Angstroms.

The interplanar distance, d_hkl, for a given plane (hkl) can be calculated using the formula from the Bragg's law context. The formula is part of the structure factor and interplanar spacing calculation.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (h^2 sin^2 α + k^2 sin^2 β + l^2 sin^2 γ)/(a^2 (1 + cos α cos β cos γ - cos α sin β sin γ cos (π - δ))) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, there's a simplified formula because all the angles are equal, and the edges are equal too. Oh right, the formula for d_hkl in a rhombohedral system can be written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh)cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the edges (so 30 degrees here).

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Another approach: The interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can be found using a modified version of the general formula for interplanar spacing. The general formula is:

1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(
