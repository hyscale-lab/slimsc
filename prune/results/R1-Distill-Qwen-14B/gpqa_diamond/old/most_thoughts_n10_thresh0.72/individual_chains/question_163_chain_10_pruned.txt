Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that we need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. And we're supposed to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do this, along with the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A through D, each giving a pH and a volume.

Hmm, so I remember that dissolving a hydroxide in an acid is a neutralization reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so reacting it with a strong acid like HCl (which is monobasic) should produce a salt and water. The reaction would look something like Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Right?

Wait, but wait. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, isn't it? But since we're using a strong acid, it should fully dissociate. So the reaction should go to completion. So the key is to find out how much HCl is needed to completely dissolve the Fe(OH)3.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, each OH is 17.01 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.88 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check: 0.1 divided by 106.88 is approximately 0.000936 mol. So that's about 9.36e-4 moles.

The reaction equation is Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. So from the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. So for 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)3, the HCl needed is 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which is moles per liter. So to find the volume (in liters) needed, we can use moles = Molarity * Volume. Rearranging, Volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³. Hmm, close enough, considering rounding. So that's the first part.

But wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³, but do I need to account for the volume of the acid added? Because when you mix the acid with the solution, the total volume might change. Wait, but in the problem, the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So the acid is added into this 100 cm³ solution. Wait, but the initial solution is 100 cm³? No, the problem states that the "total volume" is 100 cm³. So perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume after adding the acid. Or maybe it's the solution before adding the acid. Hmm, need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says: dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in
