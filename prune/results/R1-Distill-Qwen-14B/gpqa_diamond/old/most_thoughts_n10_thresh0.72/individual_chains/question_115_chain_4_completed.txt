Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that this involves electrons, positrons, and photons after annihilation. Hmm.

The setup is that an electron is moving to the right (along the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving to the left (same axis) with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One goes upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factor is the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of light, right? So gamma equals 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. Since the positron is moving from the right, it's going left towards the electron which is moving right. So they collide head-on.

When they annihilate, they produce two photons. And both photons have the same energy. Oh, but wait, the system's total momentum has to be conserved. Since the initial particles are moving along the horizontal axis, the photons' momenta must add up to the total initial momentum in that direction. But since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right, their directions are symmetric around the horizontal axis, perhaps?

Wait, their energies are the same. So the photons have the same energy, which means their magnitudes of momentum are the same because for photons, E = pc. So each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c. Since E is the same for both, their momenta have the same magnitude but different directions.

I think I can model this using conservation of momentum. The initial total momentum is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. Let's calculate that.

First, the rest mass of an electron (and positron) is m_e. The Lorentz factor gamma is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

The momentum of each particle is gamma*m_e*v. But since v is beta*c, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), maybe it's easier to express momentum in terms of gamma and m_e.

Wait, momentum p = gamma * m * v. But v = beta * c. So p = gamma * m_e * beta * c.

Alternatively, I remember that gamma*m*c^2 is the total energy, so p = gamma * beta * m c.

Wait, but maybe I can compute the momentum in terms of gamma and m_e. Because for each particle, the momentum is p = gamma * m_e * v, where v is their velocity.

But another approach: since gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2), and beta = v/c, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So for the electron, gamma_e =4. beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682. So the electron's momentum p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c.

Similarly, for the positron, moving in the opposite direction, gamma_p=2. beta_p = sqrt(1-1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660. So its momentum p_p = gamma_p m_e beta_p c, but since it's moving to the left, its momentum is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_e - p_p? Wait, wait. The positron is moving from the right (so direction is to the left, which I'll take as negative direction), and the electron is moving to the right (positive direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions. So total initial momentum p_initial = p_e (right) + (-p_p) (left), but wait no: the positron's momentum is to the left, so when I sum, I should subtract. Let me clarify the signs.

Let me set the positive x-direction as to the right. Electron's momentum is positive. Positron is moving left, so its momentum is negative. So p_initial = p_e (right) + (-p_p) (left).

Wait, no: the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left, so negative) * (but wait, same mass? Positron has the same mass as electron, so m_e). Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each momentum. The electron's momentum p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e, and the positron's momentum p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p. But since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative.

So p_e = gamma_e m_e (beta_e c)
p_p = gamma_p m_e (beta_p (-c)) because it's moving left.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e beta_e c + gamma_p m_e (-beta_p) c.

Wait, beta is v/c, so for the electron, beta_e is positive, and for the positron, beta_p positive because speed is same direction as velocity. Wait no, the positron's velocity is to the left, so beta_p is negative? Or is beta_p just the magnitude? Hmm, maybe I should define beta as a vector here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the magnitudes and assign direction.

So electron's momentum magnitude p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c (left to right)
Positron's momentum magnitude p_p = gamma_p m_e beta_p c (right to left, so negative)

Thus, p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait no, because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So p_initial = p_e (right) + (-p_p) (since p_p is in the left direction).

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of vectors. Let me assign the positive direction as right. So electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c (positive). The positron's velocity is to the left, so its beta is in negative direction. So positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e (beta_p (-c)) = - gamma_p m_e beta_p c. So the total momentum is p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e beta_e c - gamma_p m_e beta_p c.

So let's compute that.

Compute p_initial:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/4^2) = sqrt(1-1/16)=sqrt(15/16)=sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682
gamma_p= 2, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/2^2)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660

So,

p_initial = (4) m_e (0.9682) c  - (2) m_e (0.8660) c
= m_e c [4 * 0.9682 - 2 * 0.8660]

Calculating the terms inside:
4 * 0.9682 ≈3.8728
2 * 0.8660 ≈1.732
So 3.8728 -1.732 = 2.1408

Thus, p_initial = m_e c * 2.1408.

So the initial momentum is positive, meaning in the right direction.

Now, after annihilation, the two photons have the same energy. Let their momenta be p1 and p2.

Since photons carry momentum, and since their energies are the same, so |p1|=|p2|= E/c (since E=pc for photons).

But the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So each photon's momentum has components in x and y directions.

Let me model this. Let me assume that the photons are moving in the x-y plane. Photon 1 (upper-right) has momentum components (p_x, p_y), and photon 2 has (p_x', p_y'). Since both are moving in the right direction in x, their x-components should be positive.

But wait, the initial momentum is in the positive x direction. After annihilation, the total momentum of the photons must equal the initial momentum.

So, the sum of the x-components of the photons must equal p_initial, and the sum of the y-components must be zero (since initially, there's no y-momentum).

Let me think about the angles. Let’s say each photon makes an angle θ above and below the x-axis. So photon 1 is at angle θ above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle θ below.

Wait, but if the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right, perhaps their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

But wait, the initial momentum is in x. So the total y momentum must be zero. So the y-components of the photons must cancel each other.

Which would mean that if one photon is at +θ, the other is at -θ. But wait, that's if their magnitudes of y-components are the same. But their energies are the same. Since E=pc, and p = E/c, the magnitude of their momenta are the same. So if one is at θ above, the other at θ below, their y-components would be p sinθ and -p sinθ. So they would sum to zero. That fits with conservation of momentum.

So yes, the photons are symmetric about the x-axis, each making an angle θ with the x-axis, one above and the other below.

So each photon's momentum can be written as:

p1 = (p cosθ, p sinθ)
p2 = (p cosθ, -p sinθ)

So the total momentum after annihilation is p1 + p2 = (2 p cosθ, 0).

But the initial momentum is p_initial = m_e c * 2.1408. So the total after must equal that.

So 2 p cosθ = p_initial.

But p is the magnitude of each photon's momentum, which is E/c. And since both photons have the same energy, E = p c.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, p_initial = m_e c * 2.1408.

So 2 p cosθ = m_e c * 2.1408.

But each photon's momentum is p=E/c. So E = p c.

So first, let's compute the energy of each photon. The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

The rest mass energy of each is m_e c^2. The total energy is (gamma_e m_e c^2) + (gamma_p m_e c^2) = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 =6 m_e c^2.

After annihilation, the total energy goes into the two photons: E1 + E2 = 6 m_e c^2.

But the problem states that E1 = E2 = E. So 2E =6 m_e c^2 → E=3 m_e c^2.

So each photon has energy E=3 m_e c^2.

Thus, each photon's momentum is p = E/c =3 m_e c^2 / c =3 m_e c.

So p =3 m_e c.

Then, from the momentum conservation:

2 p cosθ = p_initial.

We have p_initial = 2.1408 m_e c.

So,

2 * (3 m_e c) * cosθ = 2.1408 m_e c.

Simplify:

(6 m_e c) cosθ = 2.1408 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = 2.1408 → cosθ = 2.1408 /6 ≈ 0.3568.

So θ = arccos(0.3568).

Calculating that, arccos(0.3568) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, but wait. Each photon is at angle θ above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them would be 2θ.

Because the angle between the two photons would be the sum of their respective angles from the x-axis. So one is at +θ, the other at -θ. The angle between them is 2θ.

So θ is about 69 degrees, so 2θ would be about 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, p_initial comes out to be 2.1408 m_e c.

Each photon's p is 3 m_e c.

So 2 p cosθ = 2 *3 m_e c * cosθ =6 m_e c cosθ.

Set equal to p_initial (2.1408 m_e c):

6 cosθ =2.1408 → cosθ = 2.1408/6 =0.3568.

θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between them is 2θ=138 degrees.

So the answer should be C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of momentum and energy. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The photons move in symmetric directions above and below the horizontal axis, and we aim to find the angle between them.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \), and the positron moves to the left with \( \gamma_p = 2 \). The momentum of each particle is given by:

\[
p = \gamma m_e \beta c
\]

where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). For the electron (\( \gamma_e = 4 \)):

\[
\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} \approx 0.9682
\]

Thus, the electron's momentum is:

\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c = 4 m_e (0.9682 c) \approx 3.8728 m_e c
\]

For the positron (\( \gamma_p = 2 \)):

\[
\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660
\]

Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:

\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c = 2 m_e (0.8660 c) \approx 1.732 m_e c
\]

The total initial momentum is:

\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = 3.8728 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = 2.1408 m_e c
\]

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
\]

After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:

\[
E_1 = E_2 = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
\]

Since photons carry energy \( E = pc \), the momentum magnitude of each photon is:

\[
p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
The photons move symmetrically above and below the horizontal axis, making angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the positive x-axis. Their momentum components are:

\[
p_1 = (p \cos\theta, p \sin\theta), \quad p_2 = (p \cos\theta, -p \sin\theta)
\]

The total momentum after annihilation is:

\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_1 + p_2 = (2 p \cos\theta, 0)
\]

From conservation of momentum, the total momentum after annihilation equals the initial momentum:

\[
2 p \cos\theta = p_{\text{initial}}
\]

Substituting \( p = 3 m_e c \) and \( p_{\text{initial}} = 2.1408 m_e c \):

\[
2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = 2.1408 m_e c
\]

Simplify:

\[
6 \cos\theta = 2.1408 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos\theta = \frac{2.1408}{6} \approx 0.3568
\]

\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between Photons
The angle between the two photons is twice the angle each makes with the x-axis:

\[
\text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta = 2(69^\circ) = 138^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
