Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The problem involves several reactions starting from compound A, leading up to compound D. The options provided are all cyclohex-enol derivatives, so I'm thinking the final product D is some sort of cyclohexene ring with substituents and an enol group.

First, let's look at compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, what structures give these NMR signals?

A triplet in the 0.9 ppm region suggests a CH2CH3 group, maybe two of them since 6H would mean three CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6H as a triplet. Let me think. If it's a triplet, maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to something else.

Wait, another possibility: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H could be two equivalent methyl groups each split into a triplet. Or perhaps a single methyl group adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, but 6H is a lot. Let's think about the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet suggests each proton is adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe it's a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, causing splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 that's next to a CH(CH2...).

Wait, maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2 something. Or maybe it's a cyclopropane? No, that's less likely. Or perhaps a diethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another approach: the triplet for 6H could be two methyl groups each attached to a CH2. If each methyl is a triplet, then that CH2 would have two neighboring groups. Wait, no, if it's a triplet, the neighboring protons must be two. So perhaps each CH2 is connected to a CH(CH2CH3)2 or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a ne
