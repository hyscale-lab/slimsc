Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, the operator P is given. It has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with [0 1; 1 0]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [0 -i; i 0], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled. Pz is (ħ/2) times [1 0; 0 -1], the Pauli Z matrix.

I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator along a direction n is given by the vector n · σ multiplied by ħ/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So in this case, the operator P must be the spin operator for the muon (which is like an electron, so spin-1/2) along some direction n.

Wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Or perhaps in spherical coordinates, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Because in x-z, the y-component is zero.

So the operator P is given by n · (Px, Py, Pz), right? So that'd be n_x * Px + n_y * Py + n_z * Pz. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1.

Let me express n_x and n_z in terms of angles. Since it's in the x-z plane,
