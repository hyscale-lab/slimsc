Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is in the x-z plane, which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, but the projection onto y is zero. So the direction vector n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, no, actually, in the x-z plane, the direction would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if we're considering spherical coordinates. But maybe I don't need that right now.

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix scaled by i. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

The operator we're interested in is P, which is the vector operator in the direction n. So the operator P is the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices. That is, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n is a unit vector, right? So n_x² + n_z² = 1. But let's think about the components. Since it's in the x-z plane, n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P is sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z. Let me write that out:

P = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Multiplying through, the (1,1) element is (ħ/2) cosθ. The (1,2) element is (ħ/2) sinθ. Similarly, the (2,1) element is (ħ/2) sinθ and (2,2) is -(ħ/2) cosθ. So the matrix representation of P is:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)        (ħ/2 sinθ)     ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)        (-ħ/2 cosθ)    ]

Wait, but the problem says that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = λ |v>, where λ is +ħ/2. So substituting, we have:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2) ]        (ħ/2 sinθ)          ]   [a]   [0]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)          (-ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2) ]   [b] = [0]

Simplifying each element:

Top-left: (ħ/2)(cosθ -1)
Top-right: (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-left: (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-right: (-ħ/2)(cosθ + 1)

So the matrix becomes:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ     ]   times (ħ/2)
[  sinθ      -(cosθ +1) ] 

So the system of equations is:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Let me write these equations:

(1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
(2) sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Hmm, I can try to solve these equations for a and b. Let's see if equation (1) can be used to express a in terms of b.

From equation (1):
(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b
a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = - (1 - cosθ )

So a = [ - sinθ / (- (1 - cosθ )) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Note that (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So,

sin theta / (1 - cos theta) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ) 
= [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] 
= cot(theta/2)

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Alternatively, a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b.

Let me set b as a parameter, say b = k. Then a = k * cot(theta/2) .

So the eigenvector components are:
a = k * cot(theta/2)
b = k

But I can write this as (cot(theta/2), 1) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but eigenvectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, so we can express the vector as (cot(theta/2), 1) up to a scalar multiple. To make it a unit vector, we need to normalize.

Wait, but wait, let's think again. Another approach is to express the eigenvector in terms of a and b, and then normalize.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to notice that for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates are along the direction n. So the eigenvector for spin-up along n is given by:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |up> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |down>

But since our direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero (because it's in the x-z plane; the projection onto y is zero, so phi is 0). So the state simplifies to cos(theta/2)|up> + sin(theta/2)|down>.

Wait, but in this case, the operator is P, which is the spin component along n. So the eigenstates would be aligned along n.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be:

[ cos(theta/2) ]
[ sin(theta/2) ]

Hmm, but wait, I need to confirm that.

Wait, the standard spin-up state along direction n with components (n_x, n_y, n_z) is:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |up> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |down>

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi=0. So it becomes:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |up> + sin(theta/2) |down>

So the vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in the problem, the operator P is given in terms of the components. So the eigenvector should match this.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is a more complicated expression involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), and hbar.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the eigenvector is normalized. So I need to make sure the vector I get is normalized.

Wait, the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) has a magnitude squared of cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1, so it's already normalized.

Hmm, but looking back, in the problem statement, the options are presented with hbar factors. However, when I calculated the eigenvector, I didn't see any hbar factors in the components. Wait, the question is about the normalized eigenvector; the options include some with sqrt(2/3) multiplied by hbar, which seems odd because eigenvectors are dimensionless, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, the operator components are given in terms of ħ/2 times matrices. So the eigenvalues would have units of ħ, and the eigenvectors are dimensionless, just vectors in Hilbert space. So the eigenvectors shouldn't have any ħ factors. So options A and D, which have hbar in them, are probably incorrect. So the correct option is either B or C.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which might not be normalized. Wait, let's see. The magnitude would be cos
