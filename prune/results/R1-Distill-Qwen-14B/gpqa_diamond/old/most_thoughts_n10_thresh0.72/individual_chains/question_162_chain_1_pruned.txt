Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on the coefficients.

So, the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a saddle shape. But wait, I'm not sure if pseudosphere is the same as a hyperboloid. Oh wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature, but in 3D, it's a bit different. But maybe here we're dealing with a 2D surface embedded in some way.

Wait, the metric given is in terms of x and y. So it's a two-dimensional metric. Let me see: the line element is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So the coefficient is a function of x² + y². That makes me think that the spatial part is conformally flat, similar to the metric for a sphere or hyperboloid.

Wait, for a sphere, the metric is something like (a²/(1 + (x² + y²)/a² )) (dx² + dy²), but that's for a 3D sphere
