Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the product is after a series of reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexanone with a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so a CH2OH attached). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached at the middle carbon. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (1-ketone), a CH2OH at C3, and an allyl group at C5.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent, especially for things like alcohols. The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group, so maybe the OH group there is deprotonated. After that, benzyl bromide would probably perform an alkylation. So, the -O- from the CH2OH would attack the benzyl bromide, substituting the bromide. So the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) would become a CH2O-benzyl group. So after this step, product 1 would have a benzyl ether at position 3.

So product 1 is 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclohexanone with a benzyl ether (OCH2Ph) at C3 and the same allyl group at C5.

Next step, product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsOH) in the presence of HCl as a catalyst. Wait, p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) hydrazide is used for the Hofmann degradation, I think. Hofmann degradation is used to convert an amide into an amine by treating with hydrazine, then oxidizing. But wait, in this case, are we dealing with an amide or something else? Alternatively, maybe it's a Curtius rearrangement or something else. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: the presence of HCl suggests it's an acid-catalyzed reaction. So maybe the benzyl ether is being converted into a tosylate. Because TsOH is a good leaving group. Wait, how? Let me think again. p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is H2N-NH-Ts. When you have an alcohol and treat it with TsNHNH2 in HCl, maybe it's forming a tosylate. Wait, but the starting material after step one is a benzyl ether. So in product 1, the O from the CH2O-Ph (benzyloxy) is attached to the cyclohexane. So maybe in step 2, the oxygen is being converted into a better leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl group is a good leaving group, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl group is being converted into a tosylate, but in product 1, it's already an ether. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the benzyl ether is not the site of reaction. Let me think about the possibility of the ketone reacting. The starting material has a ketone. When ketones are treated with hydrazine derivatives, they can form hydrazones. So, maybe in step 2, the ketone is reacting with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. So, the ketone (cyclohexanone) would form a hydrazone with TsNHNH2.
