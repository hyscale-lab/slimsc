Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions with a potential given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in central potentials, the Hamiltonian often separates into radial and angular parts. So maybe I should try to express the given potential in a way that shows its dependence on r and θ.

Looking at the potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out r²: V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Wait a second, that looks like it can be rewritten using some trigonometric identities. Oh right, cos²θ can be expressed as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me plug that in:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ].
Wait no, let me compute that properly. Wait, the original terms are 1/2 kr² and 3/2 kr² cos²θ. So combining the terms gives:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Now, substituting cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2:

= (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2)cos2θ.

So the potential becomes (k r²/2) * [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ].

Hmm, that simplifies to (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe considering whether the potential can be expressed in terms of a harmonic oscillator in r and some angular component.

Wait, another approach. The potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

But perhaps it's better to look for a coordinate transformation or to see if the potential is separable. Alternatively, considering that the potential is of the form of two-dimensional harmonic oscillators with an angular dependence.

Wait, in two dimensions, the radial part is usually in polar coordinates. The kinetic energy is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²). But when you have a potential that includes terms in r² and r² cosθ, perhaps it's better to switch to other coordinates, like Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, if I use Cartesian coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²). Let me express the potential in terms of x and y.

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (x²)/(r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting. Because r² = x² + y². So substituting that in:

V(x, y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Combine terms: (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = [ (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ] + (1/2)k y².

Which is 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! So the potential becomes V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators in x and y directions, but with different frequencies. Because in each direction, the potential is a quadratic term.

So in this case, the Hamiltonian would be the sum of two independent harmonic oscillators.

So the energy levels for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏ ω, where ω is sqrt(k/m). But wait, in the x-direction, the potential is 2k x², so the effective k_x is 2k. So the frequency ω_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ). Similarly, in the y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y², so the frequency ω_y = sqrt( (k)/(2m) )? Wait no, wait, the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So the coefficient of x² is (1/2) m ω². So to match, for the x-direction potential 2k x², we have (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/(m) → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y-direction potential (1/2)k y²: (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2) k → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, so each direction has its own frequency.

In quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian separates into independent parts for x and y, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

So the total energy E would be E = E_x + E_y.

Each E_x and E_y are the energy levels for their respective harmonic oscillators.

For the x-direction: E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x.

ω_x = sqrt( (2k)/m ), right? Wait, because the x potential is 2k x², and the standard form is (1/2) m ω^2 x². So 2k x^2 = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → m ω_x² = 4k → ω_x = 2
