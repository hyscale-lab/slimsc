Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between energy levels, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules. Right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, but for s states, like l=0, the possible transitions must change l by ±1. So from l=0 (n=3), the first transition would go to l=1 (n=2 or maybe n=4, but since it's going down to n=1, probably n=2). So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1, something.

But wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. The next state should have l=1, because dipole transitions require Δl=±1. So from l=0 to l=1. Okay, that means the first state after transition is |2,1, m>, but what's m?

Also, the final state is |1,0,0>, so the second transition must take l=1 to l=0, which fits the selection rule again. So the two-step process makes sense.

Now, each transition has its own probability, but the question is about the overall probability. I'm a bit fuzzy on how the probabilities combine, but I think each transition contributes a probability factor.

Wait, another thing. The dipole transition matrix elements depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the spherical harmonics overlaps. For the transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m changes are 0 → m can be -1, 0, +1. So from |3,0,0>, the first transition can go to |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,+1>.

But the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> must have Δl = -1 again. So, the second transition requires that m goes to m=0 because the final state is m=0. So in the first transition, m can be -1, 0, or +1, but then in the second step, how does m change?

Let's think: for each possible first transition, what's the probability of the second transition. But I'm not sure about the exact probabilities. Alternatively, maybe each possible first transition has the same probability, and the total is the sum of the possible paths.

Wait, the question gives options for the transition routes and their probabilities. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0, and probability 1/3. Hmm, but why 1/3? There are three possible m values for the first transition.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0, probability 1/4. I don't know why 1/4.

Option C: →2,1,-1 →1,0,0, with

Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions involve changes in the quantum numbers n, l, and m.

Hmm, dipole transitions. Right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are something like Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, and for hydrogen, the transitions are governed by the electric dipole approximation. So n can change by any integer, but l must change by ±1, and m can change by 0, ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So n goes from 3 to 1, which is a change of -2. So the transition must involve two steps because a single dipole transition can only change l by ±1, but here, the initial l is 0, and the final l is 0. Wait, that's a problem because for a dipole transition, l has to change by ±1. So the initial state l=0, so the first transition must go to l=1, and then to l=0 again in the next step.

So the process is |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩. The intermediate state must have l=1, because from l=0, you can only go to l=1 in the first step (Δl=+1), and then from l=1, you can go down to l=0 in the second step.

So the possible intermediate states would have l=1 and n less than 3. Since initial n=3, the first step could be going to n=2 or n=4. But wait, the final state is n=1, so the intermediate state's n must be such that another transition can reach n=1. Let's think: The first transition is from n=3 to n=2 (since 3-1=2) or maybe n=3 to n=4? But n=4 to n=1 is a big jump, but wait, in dipole transitions, n can change by any integer, but the other selection rules (like l) must be followed.

Wait, no, the main point is l changes by ±1 each time. So from |3,0,0⟩, first transition must be to a state with l=1. So possible n could be 2 or 4? Because n can change as long as l changes by ±1.

Wait, but the final state is |1,0,0⟩. So let's see. Let me think about the possible steps.

First transition: n=3, l=0 → n=2, l=1. Or n=3 → n=4, l=1. Because l changes from 0 to 1 (Δl=+1). Then the second transition would need to go from l=1 to l=
