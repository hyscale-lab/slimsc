Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that effective field theories are used when you have some high-energy physics that you can't see directly, so you model it with higher-dimensional operators. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries involved.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. So I need to think about each of these symmetries and whether they are required.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because in the Standard Model, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental part, and SMEFT is built upon it. So operators in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Like the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. If the theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant, then it has Poincare symmetry. But I'm not sure if SMEFT necessarily includes translations. Wait, the effective theory is typically considered in a particular frame, perhaps the lab frame. But I think SMEFT is formulated in a way that respects Poincare symmetry because it's built from the SM which does. But wait, do all operators respect that? Maybe not. Because higher-dimensional operators could have terms that don't respect translations. Wait, but SMEFT is
