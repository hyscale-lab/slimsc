Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, I remember that when you measure an observable, the outcome is one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator, and the state of the system collapses into the corresponding eigenvector. But wait, since we're measuring Q after P, the state after measuring P will be used for the Q measurement.

Let me start by writing down what I know.

The initial state vector is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So I should probably check if this vector is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). I might need to normalize this state for calculations, because probabilities depend on the inner products, which require the state to be normalized.

So the initial state |ψ> is [ -1; 2; 1 ] divided by sqrt(6). Let me note that down.

Next, let's look at the operator for P, which I'll call matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. I should probably find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors to find possible outcomes when measuring P.

The operator for Q, matrix Q, has first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix. That makes things easier because its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements. So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. For example, |q1> = [1; 0; 0], |q-1> = [0;0;1], and |q0> is [0;1;0], since the middle component is 0.

Wait, no. Because Q's second element is 0, but the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 would be any vector in the subspace where the second component is zero? Or wait, the matrix Q is diagonal with 1,0,-1. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So |q1> is [1;0;0], |q0> is [0;1;0], and |q-1> is [0;0;1]. Wait no, because for eigenvalue 0, the matrix Q |v> =0|v> implies that (Q-0I)|v>=0, so (1 0 0; 0 0 0; 0 0 -1) times |v> is zero. So the only solution is v2=0, but v1 and v3 can be anything? Wait, no. Let me think again. No, because Q is diagonal. So for eigenvalue 0, (Q - 0I) is the same as Q, so the equation is Q|v> =0. That would require the first component to be zero (because 1*v1 =0 → v1=0), third component to be zero (because (-1)*v3=0 → v3=0), but v2 can be anything. So the eigenvectors for Q=0 are vectors of the form [0; v2; 0], so any vector along the y-axis in this 3D space. So |q0> could be any such vector, but in this case, it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0, so that's a whole subspace, not a single vector.

But for the measurement, when you measure Q, the state collapses into an eigenvector of Q. But wait, in this case, since the eigenspace for Q=0 is two-dimensional (all vectors with v1=0 and v3=0), the measurement outcome 0 can be any vector in that subspace.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's get back to the problem. We need the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1. Wait no: the question says, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in respective measurements. So first measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1.

Wait, no—the question says, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P. So the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q.

Wait, no, actually, the question's exact wording is: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?"

So yes, first P is measured, outcome 0, then Q is measured, outcome -1. So the overall probability is the product of probabilities of each, conditional on the previous measurement.

Wait no, actually, when measuring P first, the system collapses into an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, when measuring Q on that state, the outcome is -1. So we need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, and then measuring Q on the resulting state gives -1.

So the approach is:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0.

2. For each such eigenvector, compute the probability of collapsing into that state when the initial state is |ψ>.

3. Then, for each such eigenvector, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1
