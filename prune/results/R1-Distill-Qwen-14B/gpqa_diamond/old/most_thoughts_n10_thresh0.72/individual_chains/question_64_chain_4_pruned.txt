Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit overwhelmed, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm going to think out loud here, just like I would if I were trying to figure this out on my own.

Alright, so the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. 

The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g (CuO formed), and tube 2 doesn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure (which I think is 0°C and 1 atm, so 22.4 L/mol, right? So 2.24 L is 0.1 mol.)

I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Hmm. Let's start by understanding what each tube does. 

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant. It's anhydrous, so it probably absorbs water. So the gas passing through it must have some water vapor. When water is absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2, it gains mass. So the weight increase in tube 1 (3.60g) is from water vapor, H2O.

So the mass of H2O is 3.60g. Let's check: Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol of H2O. So 0.2 moles of water were in the gas mixture.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. But it didn't change weight. That suggests that no gas was absorbed. Ca(OH)2 solution can absorb CO2 because CO2 reacts with it: CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3↓ + H2O. But if the solution's weight didn't change, maybe no CO2 was present. Alternatively, maybe the solution was in excess, but that's less likely. So perhaps no CO2 passed through tube 2.

Wait, but if the solution's weight didn't change, then the gas that passed through didn't react with it. So the gas after tube 1 doesn't include CO2, maybe? Or perhaps it's not a gas that reacts with Ca(OH)2, but I can't think of another. Well, maybe the gas is like H2, which doesn't react. Hmm. But wait, let's think about the possible gases produced when salts are heated.

When you heat salts, common gases produced are H2O (if hydroxides or something with water), CO2 (if carbonates or other carbons), NH3 (if ammonium salts), SO2 or H
