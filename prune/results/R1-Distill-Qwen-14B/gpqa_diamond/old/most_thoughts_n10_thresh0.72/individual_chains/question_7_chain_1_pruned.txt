Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and its photons have really low energy. The problem states that the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV.

The question is about the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the annihilation process γγ → e+ e-. I think this has to do with the probability of such interactions. So, the idea is that these gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, which would limit how long they can exist—so their lifetime depends on this process.

I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electrons is given by some formula. Wait, cross-section σ is a measure of the probability of the interaction. The cross-section for two photons (γγ) to produce electron-positron pairs might depend on the energy of the photons involved.

From what I recall, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- increases with the center-of-mass energy of the photons. The center-of-mass energy (s) is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2, but when one photon is much more energetic than the other, which is the case here since the CMB photons are low energy, the center-of-mass energy is roughly 2E if E is the energy of the high-energy photon and E_cmb is much smaller. But wait, I think the exact formula might be s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 ≈ (E_γ)^2, since E_cmb is negligible compared to E_γ.

The cross-section for this process, I think, scales with the square of the logarithm of the energy. Or wait, more accurately, for high energies, the cross-section σ scales as σ ∝ (E_γ)^2 * (E_cmb)^2 / (E_γ^4) )? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think in terms of the photon-photon cross-section formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron pairs peaks when the product of the photon energies is about 0.511 MeV squared. So the condition for the reaction being possible is E_γ * E_cmb ≈ (0.511 MeV)^2. But wait, no, that's the condition for pair production by a single photon in a medium. Maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, I think the photon-photon cross-section is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 m_e^2) / (s) ), where α is the fine-structure constant, m_e is the electron mass, and s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. So σ ≈ (8π/3) α² m_e² / s.

But wait, that formula might not include all the factors. Alternatively, I've heard that σ is proportional to (E_γ * E_cmb)^2 / (m_e² c^4), but that's when the photons are colliding head-on. Because in the CMB, the photons are isotropic, but for the high-energy gamma-ray moving through the CMB, most interactions would be with photons moving in the opposite direction, so their energies would add in the center of mass frame. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the cross-section again. The photon-photon cross-section is given by:

σ(γγ → e+ e-) = (8π/3) * (α² m_e² c^4) / (s)

where s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 when they are moving in opposite directions. But since E_γ is much larger than E_cmb, s ≈ (2 E_γ)^2, so s ≈ 4 E_γ².

Wait, no, because when the two photons are moving in opposite directions, their energies add in the center-of-mass frame. So the actual center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_γ +
