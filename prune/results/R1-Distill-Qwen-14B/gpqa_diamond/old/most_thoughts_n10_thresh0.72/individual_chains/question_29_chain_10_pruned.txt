Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the first exon. The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, the anti-nutritional compound is probably because the gene is active. So if we can disrupt the gene's function, the compound won't be made. That makes sense. So the mutations must disrupt the gene's function.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. Let me compare the wild type and each mutant.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. The first part is the start codon ATG, then some sequence.

Mutant 1: The sequence after ATG is TTTCTACGCT... Wait, the third position after ATG in wild type is T, but in mutant 1 it's C. Let me count: the wild type is ATG TTT CT C G C TGG... So the first few nucleotides after ATG are TTTCTC. In mutant 1, it's TTTCTA. Oh, wait, look: the wild type has C in position 6 (as per the sequences given). Let me see the exact point where the change is.

Wait, the wild type is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, comparing each nucleotide. Let's line them up.

Wild type: ATG T T T C T C G C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG T T C T A C G C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so after ATG, the third position is T, then T, then T in wild type. In mutant 1, after ATG, it's T, then T, then C. So the third T becomes C? Let me check the exact indices.

Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Wild type: positions 1-20: 5’-ATG TTT CT C G C TGG TAC TT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A CG C TGG TAC...

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where exactly the mutations occur.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to focus on where the changes are in each mutant.

Let me compare each mutant to the wild type.

Wild type: Exon starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT
