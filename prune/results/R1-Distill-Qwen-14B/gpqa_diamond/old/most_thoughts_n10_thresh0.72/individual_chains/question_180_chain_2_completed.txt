Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, e is the elementary charge, right? Which is approximately 1.6e-19 coulombs. Each particle has twice that, so 3.2e-19 C. But wait, maybe I should keep it as 2e for now.

Now, the setup is an isolated system. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, I imagine point P is the origin, and the 12 charges are all located on the surface of a sphere with a radius of 2 meters, each at a distance of 2 m from P. The 13th is at P, so fixed there.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. The formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j)/r_ij for all i < j.

So in this case, I have 13 charges. Let's call the charge at P as Q (which is 2e), and the others as q each (also 2e).

So, the total potential energy U will be the sum of all the interactions between each pair. Let's break it down.

First, interactions between the charge at P (Q) and each of the 12 charges at radius 2 m. Each of those interactions contributes a term. Then, the interactions between the 12 charges on the sphere with each other.

Wait, so U_total = U1 + U2, where U1 is the energy due to Q interacting with each of the 12 charges, and U2 is the energy due to the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Calculating U1: Since Q is at P, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m. Each pair consists of Q and another charge.

So U1 = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q * q) / r, and there are 12 such pairs.

Wait, Q and q are both 2e, right? So substituting, Q=2e and q=2e. So each term in U1 is (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m). Wait, but since there are 12 terms, U1 = 12 * ( (2e)(2e) ) / (4πε₀ * 2m )

Let me compute that. So U1 = 12 * (4e²) / (4πε₀ * 2 * 2) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express it correctly.

Each of the 12 charges contributes a term. So U1 = 12 * [ (2e) * (2e) ] / (4πε₀ * 2m )

So that's 12 * (4e²) / (4πε₀ * 4) ) because 2m is the denominator. Wait, wait, 4πε₀ is a common factor, but I think I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, 4πε₀ is a constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So perhaps I can compute everything numerically.

But maybe I should first compute U1 and then U2.

Next, U2 is the potential energy due to the 12 charges on the sphere interacting with each other. Each of the 12 charges is identical and located on a sphere of radius 2m, so the distance between any two charges on the sphere would be determined by the angle between them. Hmm, but wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P, which I assume is the center. So the distance between any two charges would vary based on their positions on the sphere.

Wait, but if the charges are identical and the system is symmetric, maybe the minimum energy configuration is when they're equally spaced on the sphere. So perhaps the potential energy between each pair is the same, so I can compute the energy for one pair and multiply by the number of pairs.

Wait, but the number of pairs among 12 charges is (12 choose 2) = 66 pairs.

But wait, each pair's distance isn't the same unless the 12 charges are arranged in a regular way, like the vertices of an icosahedron or something. But the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that all the charges are equally spaced, perhaps arranged symmetrically on the sphere, so that each pair is at the same distance. That would make sense for calculating the total potential energy.

But wait, if that's the case, what's the distance between two charges on a sphere of radius r? Hmm, the distance between two points on a sphere of radius r, separated by an angle θ, is d = 2r sin(θ/2). But in the case of 12 equally spaced points on a sphere, perhaps arranged with each adjacent pair separated by a certain angle.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 12 points on a sphere... Well, perhaps it's the vertices of a regular icosahedron, which has 12 vertices. Each vertex is equally distant from its neighbors. But the exact distance would depend on the radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making a simplification, such that the charges are all at the same distance from each other. But that's not possible unless all pairs are at the same distance, which is only possible for some numbers of points, like 4 (tetrahedron), 6 (octahedron), 8 (cube), 12 (maybe a different polyhedron), etc.

Wait, but the problem might be making an assumption that the charges are equally spaced on the sphere, so that each pair is equally distant, so I can compute the distance between any two as the same.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other as from the center. So each pair of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m. But that can't be right, because if all the charges are 2m away from the center, two charges can't both be 2m apart from each other unless they're diametrically opposite. But for 12 charges, that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are on a sphere, and the distance between any two is 2m. But that's only possible if all the charges are at the same point, which would lead to infinite repulsion, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that each of the 12 charges is at a distance 2m from P, and the mutual distances between the 12 charges are negligible. Or maybe it's considered that each of the 12 charges is at a distance 2m from P, but the distances between the 12 charges are also 2m. That can't be, unless all 12 are at the same point, which is not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not important, and perhaps the problem is treating each of their mutual interactions as if they're at the same distance as from P. But that seems unlikely because their mutual distances would vary.

Wait, perhaps the problem is making a mistake, and perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2m from P, but their mutual distances are such that each pair is 2m apart. But that would only be possible if all 12 are arranged in a very specific way, perhaps on a regular dodecahedron or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point as P, but that can't be because they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So that’s not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the system's potential energy is minimized when the charges are placed in a way that the repulsion is minimized. But since the 12 charges can't move closer to P, they must arrange themselves to minimize the potential energy among themselves.

Wait, but in reality, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive. So to minimize the energy, the charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible, which would be on the surface of a sphere around P. So perhaps the arrangement is such that each of the 12 charges is equally spaced on the sphere, leading to the minimal possible potential energy.

But even so, without knowing the exact distances, it's hard to compute the sum of all the pairwise interactions. So perhaps the problem is assuming that each pair of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m. But that can't be correct because arranging 12 charges on a sphere such that each is 2m from every other would require them all to be at the same point, which is impossible unless they're all coinciding, but that's not a valid arrangement for point charges.

Hmm. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are much larger than 2m, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th charge, and not the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. But that would be unusual because the potential energy of the entire system includes all pairs.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are all at a fixed radius of 2m, but their positions on the sphere are fixed, perhaps in a symmetric way. But the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so perhaps it's making an assumption that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that can't be because they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, so they must be on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the system. There are 13 charges: one at P (charge Q=2e) and 12 at r=2m. Each of the 12 has charge q=2e. The potential energy of the system is the sum of all the pair-wise interactions.

So the potential energy U is calculated as:

U = U1 + U2,

where U1 is the energy from the interactions between the fixed charge at P and the 12 charges on the sphere, and U2 is the energy from the interactions between the 12 charges on the sphere.

Calculating U1: Each of the 12 charges interacts with the charge at P. Each of these interactions contributes (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q * q) / r.

So U1 = 12 * (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / 2m.

Simplify that:

U1 = 12 * (4e²) / (4πε₀ * 2 * 2m)

Wait, let's compute that numerically.

But wait, 4πε₀ is a constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So let's compute U1:

U1 = 12 * (2e * 2e) / (4πε₀ * 2m)

Which is 12 * (4e²) / (8.988e9 * 2 * 2) [since 4πε₀ is 8.988e9].

Wait, wait no. Let's compute this correctly.

Wait, the denominator is 4πε₀ multiplied by the distance. So the distance is 2m.

So U1 = 12 * ( (2e)(2e) ) / (4πε₀ * 2 m )

So that's 12 * 4e² / (4πε₀ * 2 * 2 m) ?

Wait, no, wait, it's 12 * (4e²) / (4πε₀ * 2m)

Wait, 4e² comes from (2e)(2e) = 4e².

So U1 = 12 * 4e² / (4πε₀ * 2m )

Wait, 4πε₀ is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So substituting the values:

e = 1.6e-19 C

So e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So 4e² = 4 * 2.56e-38 = 1.024e-37 C².

Putting it all together:

U1 = 12 * 1.024e-37 / (8.988e9 * 2 * 2)

Wait, wait, the denominator is 4πε₀ times the distance.

Wait, no, the denominator is (4πε₀) * distance. The distance is 2m. So 4πε₀ is 8.988e9, so denominator is 8.988e9 * 2 = 1.7976e10.

So denominator is 1.7976e10 N·m²/C² * m = 1.7976e10 N·m²/C² * m ?

Wait, wait, no. The units for 1/(4πε₀) are N·m²/C². So when you multiply by distance (m), the denominator becomes N·m²/C² * m = N·m³/C².

Wait, maybe I should proceed numerically.

So U1 = 12 * (4e²) / (4πε₀ * 2m) 

= 12 * (4 * (1.6e-19)^2 ) / ( (8.988e9) * 2 )

Wait, let's compute each part.

First, compute numerator: 4e² = 4*(1.6e-19)^2 = 4*(2.56e-38) = 1.024e-37.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 1.024e-37 = 1.2288e-36.

Denominator: 8.988e9 * 2 = 1.7976e10.

So U1 = 1.2288e-36 / 1.7976e10 = approximately 6.84e-47 J.

Wait, that's a very small number. But let's proceed.

Now, U2 is the potential energy due to the interactions between the 12 charges on the sphere. Each pair contributes (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the two charges.

But since all 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two charges is at least 0 (if they're at the same point, which they're not) and up to 4m (diametrically opposite). But what's the average distance?

Wait, without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other. But that can't be correct because that would require them to be on the same point, which is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is at a distance of 2m from every other charge, but that's not possible except for perhaps 2 points (diametrically opposite), but for 12 points, that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making an approximation that the distance between any two of the 12 charges is the same, say, 2m. But I think that's incorrect because, as I said, you can't have 12 points all 2m apart on a sphere of radius 2m.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 4m from each other, but that would require them all to be at the same point on the sphere, which isn't possible either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let's think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th, and not the interactions among the 12 charges. But that would be unusual because the total potential energy includes all pairs.

Wait, looking at the answer options, some are in the order of 1e-26 J, which is way larger than the U1 I calculated earlier. So perhaps U2 is the dominant term.

Wait, but how can that be? Let me think again. U1 is 6.84e-47 J, which is extremely small. So unless U2 is a huge positive number, which would require that the 12 charges are extremely close to each other, which contradicts the problem statement that they're fixed at 2m from P.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating U1. Let me double-check.

The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the charge at P is (1/(4πε₀))*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

So each term is (4e²)/(4πε₀ * 2m) = (4e²)/(8πε₀ m).

Then, U1 is 12 times that.

So U1 = 12 * (4e²)/(8πε₀ m) ) = (12 * 4e²)/(8πε₀ m) ) → simplifies to (48 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) ) → 6 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Wait, that's another way to express it. Let me compute that.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

π ≈ 3.1416, so π ≈ 3.14.

ε₀ is approximately 8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²).

m is 2 meters.

So substituting into U1:

U1 = 6 * (2.56e-38) / (3.1416 * 8.854e-12 * 2)

Denominator: 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 2.7755e-11. Multiply by 2 → 5.551e-11.

So numerator: 6 * 2.56e-38 = 1.536e-37.

So U1 ≈ 1.536e-37 / 5.551e-11 ≈ 2.766e-27 J.

Wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. So perhaps earlier I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, wait, 4πε₀ is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So 1/(4πε₀) is approximately 1.11265e-10 C²/(N·m²).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it more accurately.

Let me re-calculate U1.

Compute each part step by step:

Each term: (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / 2m.

= (1/(4πε₀)) * (4e²) / (2m).

= (4e²) / (8πε₀ m).

Because 4πε₀ is the denominator times 2m.

So U1 = 12 * (4e²)/(8πε₀ m) )

= (48e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) )

= (6e²)/(π ε₀ m).

Now, substituting the values:

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = 2.56e-38 C².

π ≈ 3.1416.

ε₀ = 8.854187817e-12 F/m (C²/(N·m²)).

m = 2 m.

So U1 = (6 * 2.56e-38) / (3.1416 * 8.854187817e-12 * 2 )

Let me compute the denominator first:

3.1416 ≈ 3.1416.

3.1416 * 8.854187817e-12 ≈ ?

3 * 8.85e-12 = 26.55e-12 = 2.655e-11.

0.1416 * 8.85e-12 ≈ 1.255e-12.

So total approximately 2.655e-11 + 1.255e-12 = 2.7805e-11.

Multiply by 2: 5.561e-11.

Now numerator: 6 *2.56e-38 = 1.536e-37.

So U1 = 1.536e-37 / 5.561e-11 ≈ 2.76e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 2.76e-27 J.

Hmm, but according to the answer options, the possible answers are in the 1e-26 to 1e-27 range. So maybe U2 is similar in magnitude.

But if the problem is only considering U1, then the answer would be 2.76e-27 J, which is close to option C, which is 7.056e-27. But that's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing U2.

Wait, so U2 is the potential energy between the 12 charges on the sphere. Let me compute that.

Each pair of the 12 charges contributes U_ij = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q^2) / r_ij.

The number of pairs is (12 choose 2) = 66.

But the problem is I don't know r_ij for each pair. Unless all r_ij are the same, which seems unlikely, but perhaps the problem is making an assumption that each pair is at the same distance.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or some other regular structure, so that every pair is equidistant. But without knowing the exact structure, I can't be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies and assumes that the 12 charges are all at the same distance from each other, say, 2m. But that can't be, because they're on a sphere of radius 2m. If two points on a sphere of radius 2m are separated by a distance of 2m, the angle θ between them can be found using the law of cosines: d^2 = r² + r² - 2r² cosθ.

So (2)^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2*(2)^2 cosθ → 4 = 4 +4 -8 cosθ → 4=8(1 - cosθ) → 1 - cosθ = 0.5 → cosθ = 0.5 → θ = 60 degrees.

So each pair is separated by 60 degrees on the sphere. But that would require each charge to be adjacent to others in a way that's only possible for a certain number of points. For example, a regular tetrahedron has 4 vertices and each pair is separated by about 109 degrees. For 12 points, perhaps it's possible to arrange each pair at 60 degrees, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each pair is at a distance of 2m, but that's not possible because a sphere can't accommodate 12 points all 2m apart from each other unless they are all at the same point, which isn't possible.

So perhaps the problem is making a different assumption. Maybe the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P but can move on the sphere's surface. So the minimal energy configuration would be when the charges are as far apart as possible, which would mean arranging them in a way that minimizes their mutual repulsion, i.e., arranging them as far apart as possible on the sphere. But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to compute U2.

Wait, but maybe the problem is making the assumption that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible because they're constrained to stay at 2m from P.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, and not the energy among the 12 charges. But that would make the problem a lot simpler, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the minimum energy is achieved when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the potential energy between them is minimized, but that's a configuration that requires knowing their arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 charges, and not their mutual interactions. In that case, U would be U1, which is about 2.76e-27 J. But looking at the answer options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about twice that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 or something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me go back.

U1 is the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges with the charge at P.

Each pair contributes (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)(2e) / 2m.

So each term is (4e²)/(8πε₀ m) → which is 4/(8) = 0.5 → so (0.5 e²)/(π ε₀ m).

So for 12 terms, U1 is 12 * (0.5 e²)/(π ε₀ m) ) → 6 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Wait, yes, that's correct.

So substituting the numbers again:

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

π=3.1416.

ε₀=8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²).

m=2 m.

So U1 = 6 * 2.56e-38 / (3.1416 * 8.854e-12 * 2 )

Compute denominator:

3.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 2.7755e-11.

Multiply by 2 → 5.551e-11.

Numerator: 6 * 2.56e-38 = 1.536e-37.

So U1 = 1.536e-37 / 5.551e-11 ≈ approx 2.766e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.766e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is an order of magnitude higher. Option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about twice as much as my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms? Let me check again.

Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge. So 12 terms. Each term is (2e)^2/(4πε₀ * 2m), multiplied by 12.

Wait, (2e)^2 =4e².

So each term is (1/(4πε₀)) * (4e²)/(2m) ) → (4e²)/(8πε₀ m) → 0.5 e²/(π ε₀ m).

So 12 terms: 12 * 0.5 e²/(π ε₀ m) → 6 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Which is what I have. So that seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual energy U2 between the 12 charges is the same as U1. But that doesn't make sense because U2 would be much larger since there are 66 pairs, each at a distance of 2m.

Wait, but wait, if all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other as from the center, which is 2m, then each of their mutual distances is 2m. But that's impossible for more than a few charges, as discussed earlier.

But perhaps the problem is making that assumption, which would make U2 = (66) * (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)^2 / (2m).

So U2 would be 66 * (4e²)/(8πε₀ m) ) → same as 66 * 0.5 e²/(π ε₀ m) → 33 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Which is 33 times larger than U1.

So U_total = U1 + U2 = (6 + 33) e²/(π ε₀ m) → 39 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Wait, that would give a much larger U_total, but the answer options don't have anything that big.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged so that each is at a distance of 2m from every other, which is not possible, but for the sake of calculation.

But that would mean U2 = 66 * (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)^2 / (2m) → 66 * 4e²/(8πε₀ m) → 66 * 0.5 e²/(π ε₀ m) → 33 e²/(π ε₀ m).

So U_total = U1 + U2 = 6e²/(π ε₀ m) ) + 33 e²/(π ε₀ m) ) → 39 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Which is 39 times U1.

So substituting numbers:

39 * 2.766e-27 J ≈ 1.078e-25 J.

But none of the options are that big. The options are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering U1, so the answer would be approximately 2.766e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.5 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating U1. Let me recompute it.

U1 = (6 e²) / (π ε₀ m).

e² = (1.6e-19 C)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

π ≈ 3.1416.

ε₀ = 8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²).

m=2 m.

So:

6 * 2.56e-38 = 1.536e-37.

Denominator: 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 * 2 = 3.1416 * 17.708e-12 ≈ 55.6e-12.

So 55.6e-12 is 5.56e-11.

So U1 = 1.536e-37 / 5.56e-11 ≈ 2.76e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.76e-27 J.

But none of the options are exactly this. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I have to consider that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is U2 = (12 choose 2) * (1/(4πε₀)) (2e)^2 / (2m).

Which would be 66 * (4e²)/(8πε₀ m) ) → 66 * 0.5 e²/(π ε₀ m) → 33 e²/(π ε₀ m).

So U_total = U1 + U2 = 6e²/(π ε₀ m) + 33e²/(π ε₀ m) )= 39e²/(π ε₀ m).

Which is 39 * 2.76e-27 = 1.0764e-25 J. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th charge, and not the mutual interactions between the 12. That would give U1 as 2.76e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27) but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the number of terms.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central charge is 2e as well. So each term is (2e)(2e) / (4πε₀ * 2m) × 12.

Wait, perhaps I should compute without any simplifications.

Each term: (2e)^2 / (4πε₀ * 2m) → 4e²/(8πε₀ m) → e²/(2πε₀ m).

So each term is e²/(2π ε₀ m).

12 terms: 12 * e²/(2π ε₀ m) → 6 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute e² and see.

e² = (1.6e-19 C)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So 6 * 2.56e-38 = 1.536e-37.

Denominator: π * ε₀ * m = 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 * 2.

Compute denominator:

3.1416 * 8.854e-12 = 2.7755e-11.

Multiply by 2 → 5.551e-11.

So U1 = 1.536e-37 / 5.551e-11 ≈ 2.766e-27 J.

Hmm. But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, but I'm still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually considering that the 12 charges are arranged at the same point as each other, but that's not possible because they're all at 2m from P. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all 12 charges are at the same point, but that's impossible because they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So they can't all be at the same location.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, not their mutual potential energy, which would make the answer U1, but it doesn't match any options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the work done to bring the 12 charges from infinity to their positions. Because when bringing a charge from infinity to a point where other charges are present, you have to consider the potential due to all existing charges at that point.

Wait, that's a different approach. The potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling all the charges.

So for the 13th charge, it's fixed at P, so no work is needed for that. But to bring each of the 12 charges to their positions, each one has to be brought from infinity to the point 2m away from P, where the other charges are already present.

So the potential at point 2m when bringing the ith charge would be the sum of the potentials due to the fixed charge at P and the (i-1) charges already placed there.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps their positions are fixed, and the work is done against the electric field created by all other charges.

So the potential energy for each charge would be the sum of the potential energies due to the fixed charge and the other charges already present.

Wait, but this complicates things. Let me think.

The total potential energy U of the system when all charges are in place is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each pair, you have (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q) / r.

In this case, the fixed charge is 2e, and the 12 charges are each 2e, arranged in a certain way.

But without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible to calculate the exact potential energy.

Wait, unless the problem is making an assumption that all the 12 charges are at the same point as the fixed charge, but that can't be because they are constrained to 2m away.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think if there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2m from each other as well, which would imply that they're all on the same point, but that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is making a mistake, and the correct answer is U1 only, which is about 2.76e-27 J. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. The question says the system is isolated, so the charges can't move closer than 2m from P. So the potential energy is solely due to the interaction between the 12 charges and the 13th charge. But that would make the answer U1, which is 2.76e-27 J, but that's not among the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)5.645 x 10^-26

B)2.822 x 10^-26

C)7.056 x 10^-27

D)122.330

So option C is about 7.056e-27, which is about twice my calculated U1 of ~2.76e-27 J. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are at a distance of 4m from each other, not 2m. Because if each is 2m from P, and another charge is on the opposite side, their distance would be 4m.

But in reality, the distance depends on their arrangement.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distance between any two of the 12 charges is 2m. But that can't be, because as earlier, that would require them to be at the same point.

Hmm. Maybe I should think that the problem is only considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, and not the fixed charge. But that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the 12 charges only, not including the 13th charge. But that doesn't make sense because the 13th charge is part of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making a mistake and the 12 charges are considered to be at a distance of 2m from each other, not from P. So the mutual distance is 2m, and the distance from P is another value. But the problem states that they are at 2m from P.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since I'm not getting any of the answer options, perhaps I should try to see which option would match if I made a mistake in calculations.

Let me think: if the potential energy is U = 6 * (e²) / (4π ε₀ r) ), but perhaps I forgot a factor of 3 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes a certain amount to the potential, and the 13th is fixed, but I'm not considering that the fixed charge contributes to the potential of the 12 charges.

Wait, but I think that's already accounted for in U1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is 2e, so when calculating U1, each term is (2e)^2/(4πε₀ * 2m) multiplied by 12.

Which would be 12 * (4e²) / (8πε₀ m) ) → 12 * (0.5 e²)/(π ε₀ m) → 6 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Which is what I have.

So perhaps the correct answer is 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option. The closest option is C)7.056e-27 J. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me re-calculate U1 precisely.

Compute each part step by step:

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e^2 = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

1/(4πε₀) = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Wait no, 1/(4πε₀) is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So (1/(4πε₀)) = 8.988e9.

So for each pair between the 12 charges and the central charge:

Potential energy per pair: (8.988e9) * (2e)(2e) / (2m).

Wait, that's (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2*2).

Wait, no: the distance r is 2m.

So per pair: U = (8.988e9) * (2e)(2e) / (2m).

Wait, wait, no. The formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r.

So for each pair, it's (8.988e9) * (2e)(2e) / (2m).

So each term is 8.988e9 * 4e² / (2 * 2m) → 8.988e9 * 4e²/(4m)

Simplify: 8.988e9 * e² / m.

So for 12 pairs, U1 = 12 * (8.988e9) * e² / (2m).

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express this.

Each term is (8.988e9) * (2e)(2e) / (2m).

So per term: (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2m) = (8.988e9 *4) * e² / (2m) → (35.952e9) * e² / (2m).

So each term is (35.952e9 * e²) / (2m) → 17.976e9 e²/m.

Multiply by 12: U1 = 12 * 17.976e9 e²/m → 215.712e9 e²/m.

Wait, that can't be right because the units would be (C²) * (m²/N·C²) ) * (1/m) → (m²/N) * (1/m) ) → m/N, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm messing up the unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything numerically.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

Each term: U = (8.988e9) * (2e)(2e) / (2m).

So substituting numbers:

(8.988e9) * (2 * 1.6e-19) * (2 * 1.6e-19) / (2 * 2).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * (3.2e-19) * (3.2e-19) → 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 → approx 9.21e-28.

Denominator: 4 m.

So each term is 9.21e-28 / 4 → 2.3025e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2.3025e-28 = 2.763e-27 J.

Which matches my earlier calculation of U1 = approx 2.76e-27 J.

Hmm. So the answer should be around 2.76e-27 J, but the closest option is C)7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible, so the mutual potential energy is not considered, making the answer U1 = 2.76e-27 J. But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of charges. Wait, 13 charges: 1 at P, 12 around. So U1 is indeed 12 terms.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is intended to have the answer as U2, the mutual energy of the 12 charges, but with the assumption that each is at 2m from each other.

But that would require U2 = 66 * (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2m).

So 66 * (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 * 2) → 66 * (8.988e9 *4e²) /4 → 66 * (8.988e9 * e²).

Wait, e² is 2.56e-38.

So 8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = 2.305e-28.

Multiply by 66: 66 * 2.305e-28 ≈ 1.519e-26 J.

But that's option A (5.645e-26) or B (2.822e-26), but it's not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the answer as the sum of U1 and U2, but that would require a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, assuming each is 2m from each other.

So U2 = 66 * (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2m).

Which is 66 * (8.988e9) * 4e² / (4m) ) → 66 * (8.988e9 * e²) / m.

Compute that:

8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 = 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = 2.305e-28.

Divide by m=2: 1.1525e-28.

Multiply by 66: 66 * 1.1525e-28 = 7.599e-27 J.

Which is approximately 7.6e-27 J, which is close to option C)7.056e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in some calculation steps. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges, assuming each is at 2m from each other, which gives U2 as 7.6e-27 J, which rounds to option C.

But that would ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th charge. But perhaps the problem is intended that way.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute U2 = 66 * (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2m).

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e².

So U2 = 66 * (8.988e9) * 4e² / (2*2m).

Wait, 2*2m is 4m.

So U2 = 66 * (8.988e9 *4e²) / (4m).

Simplify: 66 * (8.988e9 * e²) ) / m.

Now, compute 8.988e9 * e².

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = 2.305e-28.

Divide by m=2: 2.305e-28 / 2 = 1.1525e-28.

Multiply by 66: 66 * 1.1525e-28 = 7.599e-27 J.

Which is approximately 7.60e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is close but not exact. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step with more precise values.

Let me compute each part accurately.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.56e-38 = 2.56 * 1e-38.

Multiply together: 8.988 * 2.56 = approx 23.05.

So 23.05e-29 (since 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29).

So 23.05e-29 = 2.305e-28.

Divide by 2 (m=2): 2.305e-28 /2 = 1.1525e-28.

Multiply by 66: 1.1525e-28 *66 =7.599e-27 J.

Which is 7.599e-27 J, which rounds to approximately 7.60e-27 J.

The option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 0.55e-27 less than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. Wait, the number of pairs is (12 choose 2) = 66, which is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2m from each other and from the central charge. But if that's the case, then the potential energy would be:

U = U1 + U2 = 2.76e-27 J + 7.6e-27 J ≈ 1.036e-26 J.

Which would be approximately 1.04e-26 J, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, and not the central charge, leading to an answer of 7.6e-27 J, which is close to option C.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, and the fact that my calculation for U2 (mutual energy) gives 7.6e-27 J, which is close to option C of 7.056e-27 J, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U2. Let me check again.

Wait, U2 is the sum of all pairs among the 12 charges. Each pair contributes (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / 2m.

So per pair: 8.988e9 *4e²/(2*2m) → 8.988e9 *4e²/(4m) → 8.988e9 *e²/m.

Number of pairs: 66.

So U2 = 66 * 8.988e9 * e² / m.

e² = 2.56e-38.

So 8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = 2.305e-28.

Divide by m=2 → 1.1525e-28.

Multiply by 66 → 7.599e-27 J.

So this seems correct.

But wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their mutual distances can't all be 2m. So perhaps the problem is making a mistake, and the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 charges, not their mutual interactions, in which case the answer would be U1 = 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Another possibility is that I messed up the conversion of units. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1/(4πε₀) is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Each charge is 2e → 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

Each term in U1 is (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / (2*2).

So (3.2e-19)^2 = 1.024e-37 C².

So per term: 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 /4 → (9.22e-28) /4 = 2.305e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.766e-27 J.

Which is correct.

But again, this doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy when bringing the 12 charges into place, considering the potential due to the fixed charge and the other charges.

So the first charge brought in has no other charges, so potential is due to the fixed charge.

The second charge brought in has the fixed charge and the first charge to consider.

But this complicates the calculation.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is brought from infinity to 2m, and the potential at that point is due to the fixed charge and the other charges already in place.

So the work done for each charge is q times the potential at the point when it's placed.

So for the first charge, the potential at 2m is due to the fixed charge: V = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e) / (2m).

So the work done to bring the first charge is (2e) * V = (2e) * (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)/(2m) ) = (4e²)/(8π ε₀ m) )= e²/(2π ε₀ m).

For the second charge, when it's brought in, there's the fixed charge and the first charge already present.

So the potential at 2m due to the fixed charge is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)/(2m), and due to the first charge is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)/(2m).

So the total potential is [ (2e)/(4π ε₀ 2m) ) ] + [ (2e)/(4π ε₀ 2m) ) ] = [ (e)/(4π ε₀ m) ) ] + [ (e)/(4π ε₀ m) ) ] = (2e)/(4π ε₀ m) ) = e/(2π ε₀ m).

So the work done for the second charge is (2e) * (e/(2π ε₀ m)) )= (2e * e)/(2π ε₀ m) )= e²/(π ε₀ m).

Similarly, for the third charge, the potential at 2m is due to the fixed charge and the two other charges.

Each of the two other charges contributes (2e)/(4π ε₀ * 2m) )= (e)/(4π ε₀ m).

So the potential is (fixed charge) + 2*(other charges) = ( (2e)/(4π ε₀ * 2m) ) + 2*( e/(4π ε₀ m) ) )= (e/(4π ε₀ m)) + (2e/(4π ε₀ m)) )= (3e)/(4π ε₀ m).

So the work done for the third charge is (2e) * (3e)/(4π ε₀ m) )= (6e²)/(4π ε₀ m) )= (3e²)/(2π ε₀ m).

Continuing this way, the work done for the nth charge would be (2e) * (n-1)*(e)/(4π ε₀ m) ), since each of the n-1 charges already present contributes e/(4π ε₀ m) to the potential.

So the total work done is the sum from n=1 to 12 of (2e) * (n-1)*e/(4π ε₀ m) ) + the work done for the fixed charge, which is zero.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that when bringing the ith charge (i from 1 to 12), the potential at the point is due to the fixed charge and the (i-1) charges already placed.

So the potential V_i is:

V_i = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)/(2m) ) + (i-1) * (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)/(2m).

Because each of the (i-1) charges contributes (2e)/(4π ε₀ * 2m) ) = e/(4π ε₀ m).

So V_i = [ (2e)/(4π ε₀ * 2m) ) ] + (i-1)*[ e/(4π ε₀ m) ) ].

Simplify:

= [ e/(4π ε₀ m) ) ] + (i-1)* [ e/(4π ε₀ m) ) ]

= [ 1 + (i-1) ] * e/(4π ε₀ m )

= i * e/(4π ε₀ m ).

The work done to bring the ith charge is q * V_i = (2e) * [ i * e/(4π ε₀ m) ) ].

So each term is (2 e * i e) / (4π ε₀ m) ) = (2 i e²) / (4π ε₀ m) ) = (i e²)/(2π ε₀ m).

The total work done is the sum from i=1 to 12 of (i e²)/(2π ε₀ m).

Which is e²/(2π ε₀ m) ) * sum(i=1 to 12 of i).

Sum from 1 to 12 is (12*13)/2 = 78.

So total work is (e²/(2π ε₀ m)) ) *78 = (78 e²)/(2π ε₀ m) ) = (39 e²)/(π ε₀ m).

Which is the same as U1 plus U2 if all mutual distances are 2m.

Wait, but earlier when considering U1 and U2 as separate, we had U_total = U1 + U2 = 6e²/(π ε₀ m) ) + 33e²/(π ε₀ m) ) = 39e²/(π ε₀ m).

Which matches the total work done here.

So the total energy of the system is 39e²/(π ε₀ m).

Now compute that:

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

π ε₀ m = 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 * 2 = 3.1416 * 17.708e-12 ≈ 55.6e-12 = 5.56e-11.

So 39 * 2.56e-38 / 5.56e-11 = (39 * 2.56e-38) /5.56e-11.

39*2.56 = 100. 39*2.56 = 99.84.

So 99.84e-38 /5.56e-11 = (99.84 /5.56 )e-27 ≈ 17.98e-27 → 1.798e-26 J.

Which is approximately 1.8e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is close but not exact.

Hmm. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Compute numerator: 39 * 2.56e-38.

39 * 2.56 = 100 (approx).

So 100e-38 = 1e-36.

Denominator: 5.56e-11.

So 1e-36 /5.56e-11 = (1/5.56) e-25 ≈ 0.1798e-25 = 1.798e-26 J.

So approximately 1.8e-26 J.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option B)2.822e-26 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the summation approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12 charges, not their mutual interactions. Which would give U1 = 6e²/(π ε₀ m) ) → 6 * 2.56e-38 / (3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2).

Compute denominator: 3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2 = 5.551e-11.

Numerator: 6 *2.56e-38 = 1.536e-37.

So U1 = 1.536e-37 /5.551e-11 = approx 2.766e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, which we calculated as 7.6e-27 J, close to option C.

Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the potential energy contributions from the interactions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the remaining 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \). The total potential energy \( U \) of the system is the sum of two contributions:

1. **Potential energy between the fixed charge at \( P \) and the 12 charges (\( U_1 \)):**
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge at \( P \). The potential energy for each pair is given by:
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2m},
   \]
   where \( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/(\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2) \) and \( m = 2 \, \text{m} \). Substituting the values:
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9}{1} \cdot \frac{(2 \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 1.024 \times 10^{-38}}{4}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-28}}{4} = 2.305 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Since there are 12 such pairs:
   \[
   U_1 = 12 \cdot 2.305 \times 10^{-28} = 2.766 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Potential energy between the 12 charges on the sphere (\( U_2 \)):**
   The 12 charges are assumed to be equally spaced on the sphere, and the distance between any two charges is taken as \( 2 \, \text{m} \). The number of pairs among the 12 charges is:
   \[
   \binom{12}{2} = 66.
   \]
   The potential energy for each pair is:
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2m}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 1.024 \times 10^{-38}}{4} = 2.305 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   For 66 pairs:
   \[
   U_2 = 66 \cdot 2.305 \times 10^{-28} = 7.599 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Total potential energy (\( U_{\text{total}} \)):**
   The total potential energy is the sum of \( U_1 \) and \( U_2 \):
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_1 + U_2 = 2.766 \times 10^{-27} + 7.599 \times 10^{-27} = 1.0365 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with options:**
   The calculated total potential energy \( U_{\text{total}} \) does not match any of the options exactly. However, the problem may be simplifying the scenario by considering only the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges (\( U_2 \)), which is approximately \( 7.6 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). This is closest to option \( C \), \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \).
