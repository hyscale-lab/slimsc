Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed, right? Because in relativity, the speed is the same regardless of which frame you're in when it's moving directly towards or away.

Wait, but wait. Since both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames, we can probably use classical mechanics here, because the speed is 60,000 km/s. Let me check: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is a fifth of that. Maybe relativistic effects aren't too bad here, but I don't know. The problem doesn't mention relativity, so maybe it's a simple velocity problem. 

The problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, but time might differ between frames. Oh, right, time dilation comes into play if we're dealing with significant fractions of the speed of light. Since 60,000 is a fifth of c, maybe it's not negligible. So I should calculate the time dilation factor.

Time dilation formula is t' = gamma * t, where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But wait, in this case, the times given are in different frames. So the time experienced in the ejecta frame (t') is 50 seconds. But we need to find the time in the galaxy frame (t), because the distance is calculated based on the galaxy's time.

Wait, no. Let me think again. We're given that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. We need to find out how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame. Because the galaxy's frame is the one from which we measure the distance the ejecta has moved.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about it. The ejecta's frame sees the galaxy moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. So the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving at the same speed, 60,000 km/s. 

In the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, in their own frame, the ejecta isn't moving—they’re stationary, and the galaxy is moving towards them. But how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during those 50 seconds?

Wait, no. The time experienced in each frame is different. So the proper time is the time measured in the object's rest frame. So, for the ejecta, the proper time is 50 seconds. The galaxy frame would see this time as longer due to time dilation.

So, the formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time (50 seconds), and t is the galaxy's frame time.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1
