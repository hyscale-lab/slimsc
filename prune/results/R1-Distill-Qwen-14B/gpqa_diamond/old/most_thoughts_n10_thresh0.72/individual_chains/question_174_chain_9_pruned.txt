Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says: An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, nothing else. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So the initial mass M is 300 GeV/c², right?

Wait, no, the rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So the rest mass M is 300 GeV/c². But when it splits, the two fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99M. So M' = 0.99*M. Because I think that when mass is converted into energy, like in fission, some mass is lost and becomes kinetic energy or other forms.

Wait, the question says the sum of the rest-masses is 99% of M. So initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, each fragment's rest-mass energy is less. So the sum of the two fragments' rest-mass energies is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. Hmm, but actually, wait, the rest masses add up to 99% of M, so the total rest mass is 0.99*M. So each fragment's mass is a fraction of that.

Wait, the problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Let me denote the mass of the smaller fragment as m, so the larger one is 2m. So m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M. So 3m = 0.99M => m = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. So the two masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. Wait, 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, right.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because of conservation of momentum. So the two fragments must move
