Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me break this down and think through the steps.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure of the target molecule. The parent ring is benzene. Attached to it are three substituents: a nitro group, a bromine, and an ethan-1-one group. The numbering must be such that the nitro is at position 5, bromo at 3, and the ketone at position 1. Wait, actually, I should double-check the numbering. Let me imagine the benzene ring. If the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro is at 5 (which is two positions away, meta to the ketone) and bromo at 3. Alternatively, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of substituents. The ketone is a substituent at one position, say position 1. Then the nitro is in the meta position relative to the ketone, which would be position 3, but wait the target is 3-bromo-5-nitro, so maybe the ketone is at position 1, nitro at 5, bromo at 3. So the ring has groups at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Alternatively, is the ketone group in a different position?

Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, so the structure is (Phenyl)C=O where the phenyl is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So the benzene is attached to a ketone group, making it acetophenone. So that's position 1 as the point of attachment.

Now, the substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 and 5. So the ring has a ketone (position 1), nitro (position 5), and bromo (position 3). So the substituents are meta to each other. Wait, but how? Let me number the ring with the ketone as position 1. Then position 2 is adjacent, position 3 is meta to position
