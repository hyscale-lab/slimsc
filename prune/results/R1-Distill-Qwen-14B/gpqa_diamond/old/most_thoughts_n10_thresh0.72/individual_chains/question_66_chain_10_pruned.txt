Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

First, I think about what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames of reference. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So, if Poincare is a symmetry, then Lorentz must also be, right? Because Poincare is a larger symmetry group that includes Lorentz transformations and translations.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT operators are supposed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory but does it respect Poincare? Well, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. I think that in the Standard Model, because it's a relativistic theory, it must respect Poincare symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT would have to respect that as well.

Then, CP symmetry is about the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetries. CPT symmetry is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. I remember that in the Standard Model, CPT is a fundamental symmetry, but CP isn't necessarily. For example, CP violation is known in the electroweak sector.

So, SMEFT operators must respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, right? Because SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model. So, if the Standard Model doesn't have a symmetry, the effective theory shouldn't either. But wait, do SMEFT operators have to respect all the Standard Model symmetries? Or can they break some? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The SMEFT preserves all the symmetries of the Standard Model. Because it's built as a low-energy effective theory that incorporates the SM. So operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM, otherwise, the theory wouldn't be a valid effective theory.

So the SM is Lorentz symmetric, so SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, and the SM is also Poincare symmetric, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare. Wait, but I'm not sure. Because in SMEFT, you can have operators that are higher-dimensional, but how does that affect symmetries?

Wait, another angle: in the SMEFT, the Lagrangian is written as a sum of operators with increasing dimension. Each operator must be compatible with the Standard Model's symmetries. So they must be invariant under the SM's gauge group and other symmetries like Lorentz.

So, SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. That means they must transform covariantly under the Lorentz group. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely one that must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Wait, but operators in the effective theory are written in a way that doesn't depend on the spac
