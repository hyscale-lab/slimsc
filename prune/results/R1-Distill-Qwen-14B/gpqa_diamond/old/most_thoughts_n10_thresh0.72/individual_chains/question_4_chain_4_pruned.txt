Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always come in pairs—north and south poles can't be isolated. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall what each equation says.

The first equation, Gauss's Law for electricity: it's about the divergence of the electric field being proportional to the charge density. I don't think that changes here because the question is about magnetism, not electricity. So probably not this one that's affected.

The second equation is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. Wait, that's because in our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist. So if we had isolated north or south poles, the divergence wouldn't be zero anymore. Oh wait, in our case, the equation is ∇·B = 0. If monopoles exist, then that equation would change. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. That must be one of the equations that changes.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of Induction, which deals with the curl of the electric field and the time derivative of the magnetic field. I think it's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. I'm not sure if the presence of magnetic monopoles would affect this equation. Wait, Faraday's Law arises from the idea that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field. I don't think monopoles change this because it's about the time variation of B. So maybe this equation stays the same.

The fourth equation is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current density and the time derivative of the electric field. The equation is ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. But again, does this change? Hmm. Ampère's Law in our universe is about how the magnetic field circulates around currents. If we have magnetic monopoles, does this affect Ampère's Law? I'm not so sure. Wait, no, Ampère's Law is about the sources of the magnetic field, which are currents. If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps there's an additional term for the magnetic current. Oh wait, in the hypothetical scenario, Maxwell's equations look different, so perhaps both Ampère's and Gauss's laws for magnetism are affected.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The original Maxwell's equations in our universe are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Now, if magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 2 would change. Instead of ∇·B = 0, it would be ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. Also, Ampère's Law (equation 4) would have an extra term. Because in our equations, the curl of B is related to current and displacement current. But if there are magnetic
