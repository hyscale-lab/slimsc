Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I'm supposed to determine which of the given partial waves isn't permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle (p, f, s, etc.)

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some concepts. I remember that in particle physics, when two particles interact, their quantum numbers must be conserved. Here, we have the initial state as 1S0, which I think refers to the total spin, orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum.

Wait, the question mentions that the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So, for 1S0, that would be (2*0+1)S0, so S=0, L=0, and J=0. So the initial NN state has spin S=0, orbital L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

Then, the NN system emits a particle X. So, the final state is the NN system plus the emitted particle. But since we're considering the NN state after emission, I think the problem is focusing on the NN system's quantum numbers after the emission.

Wait, the problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. T is the isospin. But I'm more familiar with spin, angular momentum, and parity conservation. Maybe isospin isn't directly needed here, but the equation provided involves T, S, and L. So, the equation T = S + L +1 mod 2 must hold for the final state.

Wait, the problem says Pauli statistics require that. Hmm. So, for the final state, T_final = (S_final + L_final + 1) mod 2.

Since T_final is 0, this equation becomes 0 â‰¡ (S_final + L_final +1) mod 2. So, S_final + L_final +1 must be even. So, S + L must be odd.

So, S_final + L_final must be odd. Because 1 is added, it makes the total even.

Now, the initial state has S_initial=0, L_initial=0, T_initial= ... Wait, what's T_initial? Because the initial state is a bound system of two nucleons. Hmm. Well, nucleons are protons and neutrons, and their isospin depends on their combination. But perhaps the initial state's isospin doesn't matter because we're looking at the final state's isospin, which is given as 0.

Wait, wait. The problem says the initial state is 1S0, which is the NN state.
