Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, the question is about determining the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the molecule is X-Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s. So, the problem is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, the fundamental state. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state, and it absorbs a photon. The question is about what momentum this photon must have to move it to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm. So I need to figure out the energy difference between the ground state and the next state. But wait, what's the next state? Because in molecules, there are vibrational and rotational energy levels. Oh right, the rotation-vibration model combines both, but I'm not sure how exactly.

Wait, the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in its fundamental (v=0, I think) state, and it absorbs a photon that takes it to the next higher state. But in quantum mechanics, the energy levels are quantized. So the next state could be the next vibrational level or the next rotational level. Which one has the lower energy difference?

Wait, maybe the transition is purely vibrational. Because the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0). The next state would be v=1. Because for a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are equally spaced. But wait, the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps that includes both rotation and vibration. Or maybe I'm mixing up some models.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is an extension of the rigid rotor model where the bond length isn't fixed, so it accounts for bond vibrations. So the energy levels now include both rotational and vibrational contributions. So the molecule's state is characterized by quantum numbers for both rotation (I) and vibration (v).

But for the fundamental state, I think it's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (I=0). So the next state
