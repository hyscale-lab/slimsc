Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what it's about. The question involves an experiment where compound X undergoes a reaction, and then we're given the NMR spectra of the product. My task is to determine what compound X was from the options provided.

First, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, both 1H and 13C. The options are A to D, each a different structure.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base used in elimination reactions, often in the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction or other deprotections. But wait, in this case, since the reaction is with a nonpolar solvent and at a high temperature, maybe it's an elimination reaction. So, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that is being opened, or maybe it's a ring-opening or some other rearrangement.

Looking at the product's NMR data. Let's start with the 1H NMR. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets integrating to 3H each. These are likely methyl groups attached to something deshielded but without neighboring protons, so maybe attached to an electronegative atom or in a rigid structure.

Then, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). These look like aromatic protons. Let me see: the 6.75 d is probably a proton with one neighbor (so maybe part of a para-substituted benzene or a substituent with coupling to one proton). The 7.08 (2H, d) could be a pair of protons that are adjacent, perhaps in a coupling pattern like a trans double bond or part of a conjugated system. Wait, maybe a vinyl group or something like that. The 7.68 and 7.71 doublets could be another set of aromatic protons, maybe with different substituents.

The 13C NMR data includes a few key carbons. Notably, there's a carbon at δ 197.7, which is a strong indicator of a ketone or perhaps an aldehyde. Wait, but ketones are around 205-220? Hmm, wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think. For 13C NMR, carbonyls are high. A ketone is typically around 205-225 ppm, maybe a bit lower if it's an aldehyde. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on exact ranges. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or another carbonyl group. Another high value is around 141-144, which could be carbons attached to oxygen, like in an epoxide ring.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a singlet at 197.7. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl. So maybe the reaction formed a ketone. But wait, the starting material was C11H12O. Let me think about the reaction conditions. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, so perhaps it's used to deprotonate and form a double bond, or maybe it abstracts a proton leading to an elimination.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxide opening. Epoxides can open under basic conditions. If the starting material is an epoxide, then the reaction could form a carbonyl group. Oh, because when an epoxide ring opens, especially under basic conditions, it can form a diol. But wait, no, under strong basic conditions, maybe it forms an elimination product. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a more complex structure.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR has a carbonyl at 197.7. That suggests a ketone or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like an alkenone. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but the singlet suggests no neighboring groups, so perhaps a simple ketone.

Looking again at the 1H NMR: the aromatic protons might be part of a styrene group or similar. Let me think about the splitting. The 6.75 d could be a proton that's trans to another group, perhaps. The doublets at 7.08 and 7.71 could be part of a para-substituted benzene, but it's a bit unclear.

Wait, the product's NMR shows a singlet at 2.28 and 2.31 for two methyl groups. That's 6H in total, but each as a singlet. Maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons, like an aromatic ring or a carbonyl group.

So perhaps the product is a compound with two methyl groups and a carbonyl group. Let me think about the options. The options are all oxirane derivatives, which are epoxides. Wait, oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and an oxygen. So, the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction forms a ketone? Or perhaps the epoxide remains and another change occurs.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is some kind of ring-opening under basic conditions. If the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction opens it, maybe leading to a diol. But in the NMR data, I don't see any broad peaks indicative of OH groups, so that's probably not the case. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide isn't opened but undergoes some rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a ring-opening metathesis or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces an elimination, forming a double bond and releasing a smaller molecule. For example, if the starting material is a substituted epoxide, the base could abstract a proton adjacent to the oxygen, leading to ring opening and forming a double bond.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl group at 197.7, which suggests that perhaps the epoxide ring opened to form a ketone. How would that happen? Let me think. An epoxide ring can open under acidic conditions to form a carbocation, which can then lose a proton to form a double bond. But under basic conditions, it might form an alkoxide, which could lead to different outcomes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a conjugated carbonyl. Let me think about the options. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. That's an epoxide with a styryl group (vinylbenzene) attached at position 2. The styryl group is at the 4-methyl position, meaning the substituent is on the benzene ring.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So, the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the phenyl at position 1, and the oxirane is at position 2. The structure would be something like a vinyl group with a phenyl and a methyl (since prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C=CH2 attached to something else).

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the oxirane has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group (vinylbenzene) at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So, the styryl group is attached to the oxirane at position 2.

Wait, but all these options are epoxides. So, the reaction is perhaps an elimination, converting an epoxide into a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide and the reaction converts it into a ketone via an elimination. Let me think about that. For example, if an epoxide has adjacent substituents, under basic conditions, the ring could open and form a double bond, possibly with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a di-substituted epoxide, and upon treatment with a strong base, it undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl group, so perhaps the reaction is an elimination from the starting epoxide. Let me think about the structure of the product.

Looking at the 1H NMR again. The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene with some substituents leading to doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a styrene group with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzaldehyde derivative. But the 1H NMR doesn't show a peak around 9-10 ppm, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. So, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone group. So, the reaction must have transformed the starting epoxide into a ketone.

How does that happen? Maybe via a ring-opening followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material had a structure where the epoxide ring opening leads to the formation of a carbonyl. Let me think about the possible structures.

Let me think of each option's structure and see how the reaction would proceed.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure is an epoxide ring with a styryl group attached at position 2. The styryl group is 4-methyl, so the substituent is on the benzene ring in the para position.

If this epoxide reacts with the base, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the oxygen, leading to ring opening. The ring opening would form a double bond. So, if the epoxide is between two carbon atoms, and the base abstracts a proton, the ring would open, and the two oxygen atoms would attack each other, but that might form a diol. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs to form a double bond.

Wait, but the product has a ketone. So maybe the starting epoxide, upon ring opening, forms a carbonyl group. How would that happen? Let me think of the structure. The starting material has an epoxide, which has two adjacent carbons. If during ring opening, one of the carbons gets deprotonated and forms a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material has a structure where the epoxide is adjacent to a methyl group. Upon ring opening, the methyl group is oxidized or something. Wait, but the reaction conditions are basic, so maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the product.

The product's 1H NMR has two methyl groups as singlets. So, perhaps two methyl groups attached to aromatic rings or to carbonyls.

The aromatic protons: the 6.75 d (1H), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). That's a total of 6 aromatic protons (1+2+1+2) but wait, no, the integration is 1, 2, 1, 2: total of 6H. So, perhaps two aromatic rings each with 3 protons. But wait, benzene has six protons, but if substituted, the number varies.

Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent. Let me see: 6.75 (d) could be a proton next to a substituent. The 7.08 (d, 2H) and 7.71 (d, 2H) might indicate a trans coupling. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, like para-substituted. Or perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene, leading to deshielded protons.

Wait, let me think of the 13C NMR. The carbons at 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C). Those are typical for aromatic carbons, with some being more deshielded (like carbons attached to substituents). The 197.7 is a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone.

So, the product has a carbonyl group and an aromatic system. Let's think of a structure that has a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, perhaps connected via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the product is a styrene oxide? No, styrene oxide would be an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but without the aldehyde proton.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a benzaldehyde with some substituents. But without the aldehyde proton, perhaps it's a ketone.

Another approach: the product's 1H NMR has four aromatic signals. Let me see:

- 6.75 (d, 1H): maybe a proton adjacent to a substituent, like in a vinyl group.
- 7.08 (d, 2H): perhaps a para-disubstituted benzene, so two protons as a doublet.
- 7.68 (d, 1H): another proton in a vinyl group.
- 7.71 (d, 2H): another pair, perhaps part of a trans coupling.

Wait, maybe the aromatic region corresponds to two vinyl groups attached to the benzene. For example, a 1,4-diphenylethylene structure or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 4-substituted styrene. Let's think of the coupling.

Wait, maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzaldehyde with a ketone group. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try to draw this out in my mind. The product has a carbonyl, two methyl groups, and a conjugated aromatic system.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzophenone derivative, but that doesn't fit with the NMR data. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, if the product has a structure like (CH3)2C=O connected to a benzene ring via a double bond, that might fit. For example, maybe (E)-4-methylstyrylacetone? Not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction again. The starting material is an epoxide, which reacts under basic conditions. So, perhaps the epoxide ring is opening to form a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another thing: when an epoxide is adjacent to a conjugated system, ring-opening with a base can lead to a conjugated carbonyl. For example, consider a bicyclic structure or a bridged system. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a keto group via elimination. Let's think of the structure of the starting material.

Each option is an oxirane (epoxide) with a substituent. Let's consider each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The structure would be an epoxide at position 2, with a styryl group (vinylbenzene) attached at the 4-methyl position. So, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position.

If this epoxide undergoes ring opening, perhaps via base-induced elimination, it could form a double bond further away. But would that form a ketone? Not sure.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent is a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to the phenyl. So the structure is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 attached to the oxirane. When the epoxide ring opens, perhaps elimination occurs to form a longer double bond. But again, how would that lead to a ketone?

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the epoxide is substituted with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. If the ring opens, perhaps elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3, leading to a conjugated system. But would that form a ketone? Maybe not directly.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the substituent is a styryl group (vinylbenzene) attached at position 2. The structure is a simple epoxide with a vinylbenzene group attached.

If the starting material is an epoxide with a styryl group, what would happen upon reaction with a base? Maybe the base would deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring-opening and formation of a double bond. If the epoxide is between a styryl group and another substituent, opening could form a conjugated diene or a carbonyl.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the ring opening leads to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of the acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening forming a carbonyl. But I thought the reaction was under basic conditions. Hmm, maybe it's some other mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a structure where the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a di-substituted epoxide, such as a bridged bicyclic epoxide. When the ring opens, it forms a carbonyl group. But again, not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone formed via elimination of an alcohol from the epoxide. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, let's think about the product's 13C NMR. The peaks at 126.9, 127.1, etc., suggest aromatic carbons. The 141.5 and 144.1 could be carbons attached to oxygen, perhaps in a carbonyl group.

Wait, the 144.1 is a carbon maybe attached to an oxygen, like a carbonyl. And the 141.5 could be a double-bonded carbon, maybe in a styryl group.

So, perhaps the product is a structure with a carbonyl group adjacent to a styryl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-styrylacetophenone or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the product has two methyl groups as singlets. So, perhaps two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl. Such as (CH3)2CO (acetone), but that's only three carbons. Alternatively, maybe (CH3)C(O)R, where R is an aromatic group.

Wait, if the product is (4-methylstyryl)propan-2-one, that could have two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl. Let me think: the structure would be (CH3)2C=O connected to a benzene ring via a double bond.

So, perhaps the product is (E)-4-methyl-3-buten-2-one. Wait, that doesn't fit the aromatic part.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a benzophenone derivative with two methyl groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should focus on the options and see which one makes sense.

The options all have epoxide groups. But the product has a carbonyl. So the reaction must convert the epoxide into a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which forms ketones from epoxides. But I don't recall the exact conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the methyl groups. The product has two methyl groups as singlets. So, in the structure, these methyl groups are attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons. Maybe they're attached to carbonyl groups or to aromatic rings in such a way that they don't have adjacent protons.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The substituent is a 4-methylstyryl group, which includes a methyl on the benzene ring. So, that would be one methyl group as part of the styryl. Then, the epoxide itself doesn't have a methyl group. So, the product's NMR shows two methyl groups, but this option might only have one.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent here is a propenyl group with a phenyl and a methyl group. So, the structure would be CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 attached to the epoxide. So, the substituent has a methyl group. So, the starting material has one methyl. The product, after reaction, has two methyl groups. So, maybe the reaction adds another methyl.

Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O. Let's check the molecular formula of each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Styryl group is C8H7 (since styrene is C8H8, styryl is C8H7). Oxirane is C2H4O. So, 8 (styryl) + 2 (oxirane) + 1 (methyl) = 11 carbons. The formula would be C11H10O. But the starting material is C11H12O, so maybe not. Hmm, wait, styryl is C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is C6H5-CH=CH2. So,  structure is C6H5-CH=CH-O-CH2. Wait, no, the structure is oxirane (O connecting two CH2 groups), and one of them is attached to the styryl.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Styryl group: C6H4-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is C6H4-CH=CH2. So, the substituent is C8H7 (because benzene is C6H6, styryl is C8H7 when considering the substituent as CH=CH2 attached to a benzene ring. So, the substituent is C8H7. Then, the oxirane is O-C2H4, but substituted at position 2. So, the molecule is C10H10O (since substituent is C8H7, plus two CH2 from oxirane: but wait, the substituent is attached to one of the CH2 groups. So, the formula would be (C8H7) + (CH2-O-CH2). Wait, oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen: each carbon is CH2. So, replacing one CH2 with the substituent.

So, substituent: C8H7 (from 4-methylstyryl, which is C6H4-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, 4-methylstyryl is C6H4-CH2-C(H)=CH2? No, styryl is C6H5-CH=CH2. So, 4-methylstyryl would be C6H4(CH3)-CH=CH2. So, the substituent is C9H9. Then, the oxirane is O-C2H4, but one CH2 is replaced by the substituent. So total formula: (C9H9) + (CH2-O) --> C10H11O. Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O, so this doesn't add up. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way to think about it is:

The oxirane is O connected to two CH2 groups. If one of the CH2 is substituted with the 4-methylstyryl group, which is C8H7, then the molecule would be C8H7 + CH2-O-CH2, which is C9H8O. But that's less than the starting material's C11H12O. So, maybe I'm not calculating correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is connected correctly.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of each option's molecular formula.

Let me try:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Styryl is C8H7, so the substituent is C8H7. The oxirane is O-C2H4, but one CH2 is substituted. So, the molecule is C8H7 (styryl) + CH2-O. So, total C: 8 + 2 (from CH2O) = 10? Hmm, but the starting material is C11H12O, which has 11 carbons. So, perhaps this option is not correct.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. That's a propenyl group with a phenyl at position 1 and a methyl at position 2. So, structure is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. The substituent is C9H9 (Ph is C6H5, so substituent is C6H5-CH2-C=CH2; wait, that's C8H7? Or maybe I'm getting the substituent structure wrong.

Alternatively, 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CPh=CH2. So, substituent is C9H9 (since CPh is C6H5, so substituent is C6H5-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond). So, substituent is C9H9? Then, adding to the oxirane, which is O-C2H4, but substituting one CH2. So, the molecule would be C9 (from substituent) + 2 (from oxirane) = 11 C. So, formula is C11H12O. That matches the starting material.

Wait, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So, structure is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Wait, that would make it a three-carbon chain with the middle carbon attached to the phenyl. So, substituent is C9H9 (since phenyl is C6H5, plus the three carbons: CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2? No, wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So, two CH2 groups and a C with a phenyl and a double bond.

So, the substituent is C9H9. Then, the oxirane is O-C2H4, but one CH2 is substituted with the substituent, so the structure becomes substituent-CH2-O-CH2. So, the molecule has 9 (substituent) + 2 (oxirane) -1 (since one CH2 is replaced) = 10 carbons? No, perhaps it's 9 + 2 =11. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

But if option B's molecular formula is C11H12O, which matches the starting material, then perhaps this is a possible option. But how does the reaction affect it.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Styryl is C8H7. Then, the substituent is a methyl at position 2 and a styryl at position 3. So, the molecule is (CH3)-oxirane-(styryl). So, C: 8 (styryl) + 2 (oxirane) + 1 (methyl) = 11. So, C11H12O? Let me calculate: styryl is C8H7, oxirane is two CH2 groups, one substituted with methyl and the other with styryl. Wait, perhaps the formula is C11H12O.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So, substituent is styryl at position 2. So, styryl is C8H7. The oxirane is O-C2H4, so substituent is attached to one CH2. So, the formula would be C8 (styryl) + 2 (oxirane) = 10 C. But starting material is C11, so perhaps this is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try option D:

Structure is O-C2H4 with the styryl group attached to position 2. So, the substituent is C8H7 (styryl). Then, the molecule is C8H7 + CH2-O-CH2. So, that's 8 + 2 (CH2 groups) = 10 carbons. But starting material is C11, so perhaps option D is not the correct starting material.

So, option B has molecular formula matching the starting material. So, perhaps option B is the right starting material.

Wait, but how does the reaction turn an epoxide into a product with a carbonyl group?

If the starting material is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane, then the structure is:

O
||
C - CH2 - C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, no, the structure is an epoxide with substituents at position 2. So, the epoxide is a three-membered ring: O connected to two CH2 groups. One CH2 is attached to a substituent, which is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl.

So, substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

So, the structure is:

O
||
C - CH2 - C(Ph)=CH2
|
CH2

Wait, no, perhaps better to draw it as:

The epoxide is a three-membered ring: O connected to two CH2 groups. One of the CH2 is attached to a substituent which is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

So, the structure is:

Ph
|
CH2-C(Ph)=CH2
|
O
||
C - CH2

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. But when this epoxide reacts under basic conditions, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, causing the ring to open and form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent allows for an elimination reaction, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, when the base abstracts a proton from the substituent, perhaps it forms an alkoxide, which could then eliminate to form a double bond and release water. But how would that form a ketone?

Wait, another possibility: the substituent has a hydrogen that's adjacent to the epoxide oxygen. The base abstracts that proton, leading to the opening of the epoxide ring. The resulting structure would have a double bond and perhaps a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2, then perhaps the epoxide is next to a CH2 group. Upon ring opening, perhaps the structure becomes a conjugated diene or some other structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a structure that, upon ring opening, forms a carbonyl. For example, if the substituent is a secondary alcohol, then elimination would form a carbonyl. But in this case, the substituent is a propenyl group attached to a phenyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product's structure.

The product has a carbonyl group (δ 197.7), two methyl groups (δ 2.28 and 2.31), and aromatic protons.

So, perhaps the product is a benzalacetone, where the benzene is connected via a double bond to a carbonyl group, with two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl.

So, structure like (CH3)2C=O-CH2-C6H4-CH3. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH3)C(O)CH2-C6H4-CH3. No, that's a ketone with a substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C=O connected to a benzene ring via a double bond. Such as (E)-4-methyl-3-phenylprop-1-en-2-one.

Wait, that would have a structure where the ketone (acetone) is connected via a double bond to a benzene ring. So, the structure is:

Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's not a double bond. Or perhaps Ph-CH=C-C(O)CH3.

Wait, let me think again. The product's 1H NMR shows two methyl singlets. So, perhaps the product is something like (CH3)2C=O connected to a benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (E)-4-(2,2-dimethyl-1-oxo-propenyl)benzene.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe looking back at the options is better.

The options are all epoxides, but the product has a carbonyl group. So, the reaction must have transformed the epoxide into a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement involves the dehydration of a 1,2-diol (geminal diol) to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction that forms a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about the starting material as option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

So, the structure is:

O
||
C - CH2 - C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, that's a three-membered ring with O connected to two CH2 groups. One CH2 is attached to a substituent which is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

So, the substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl attached to the central carbon.

Now, when this epoxide is treated with a strong base, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the adjacent CH2 group, leading to ring opening and the formation of a double bond.

Upon ring opening, the structure would break the epoxide, forming a new double bond. If the substituent is a propenyl group, perhaps the ring opening leads to a conjugated diene or a carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that form a carbonyl group? Maybe if the ring opening leads to the formation of an adjacent carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a structure that allows for a keto-enol tautomerism after elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that when the epoxide opens, a carbonyl is formed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. When the base abstracts a proton from the adjacent CH2, the epoxide ring opens, leading to a structure where the oxygen is between two carbons, and one of them is adjacent to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ring opening leads to the formation of a ketone. Let me imagine the structure after ring opening.

Assuming the base abstracts a proton from the CH2 group next to the epoxide, the ring opens, and the oxygen forms a double bond with one of the carbons, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, but that would require the adjacent carbon to have a hydrogen that can be abstracted. So, if the structure is:

O
||
C - CH2 - C(Ph)=CH2

The base could abstract a proton from the CH2 group adjacent to the epoxide, leading to the ring opening and the formation of a carbonyl.

So, the ring opening would lead to:

Ph
|
CH2-C(Ph)=CH2-O-CH2-

Wait, no, perhaps the ring opening would form a double bond between the two carbons, and the oxygen would become a carbonyl.

So, imagine the epoxide O is between two CH2 groups. One CH2 is attached to CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

After ring opening, perhaps the structure becomes:

CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 - CH2 - O - ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a conjugated carbonyl group. So, the product would have a structure like (CH3)2C=O attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, but the product has two methyl groups as singlets. So, maybe each methyl is attached to a carbon that's next to a carbonyl group.

So, perhaps the product is (E)-4-methyl-3-styrylprop-2-en-1-one. Or something similar.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the options again and the product's NMR.

The product has two methyl groups (singlets), which suggests they're not adjacent to any protons. So, maybe they're attached to carbonyl groups or to aromatic rings in a way that they don't have neighboring protons.

The 13C NMR has a peak at 21.3 and 28.4, which are quaternary carbons (since they're singlets). So, perhaps these are methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have neighboring carbons with protons.

Wait, the 21.3 is a carbon with a singlet, so maybe a methyl attached to a carbonyl. The 28.4 could be another methyl, perhaps attached to an aromatic ring or another group.

Wait, if the product is a ketone with two methyl groups, such as (CH3)2CO attached to a benzene ring via a double bond, then the structure would be something like (E)-4-(2,2-dimethyl-1-oxo-propenyl)benzene.

In that case, the NMR would show two methyl groups (each singlet) attached to the carbonyl, and the aromatic protons as described.

Looking back at the product's 1H NMR: the aromatic protons include a 1H doublet at 6.75, 2H doublet at 7.08, another 1H at 7.68, and 2H at 7.71.

This could correspond to a structure with a trans configuration in the double bond, leading to two sets of doublets for the aromatic protons.

Putting it all together, the product is likely a ketone with two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl, and a conjugated styryl group.

Now, looking back at the options, which starting material would lead to such a product upon reaction with the base?

Option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. If the reaction leads to the formation of a carbonyl group, perhaps via elimination, then the product would have a structure where the propenyl group is converted into a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrogenation, converting the propenyl group into a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in option B, when the epoxide opens, forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2, and the base abstracts a proton from the CH2 group adjacent to the epoxide, then the ring opens, and the oxygen becomes a carbonyl group.

So, the structure after reaction would be:

Ph
|
CH2-C(Ph)=CH2-O-CH2-

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure becomes:

Ph
|
CH2-C(Ph)=CH2-CH2-O-

No, I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2, and upon ring opening, the structure becomes:

Ph
|
CH2-C(Ph)=CH2-CH2-O-

But that would just be a longer chain with an oxygen, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent after ring opening forms a carbonyl group at the site where the epoxide was.

So, the epoxide was at position 2, and upon opening, the oxygen forms a carbonyl, leading to a structure like (CH3)2CO attached to the benzene ring.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone from the epoxide, which would require the adjacent groups to allow for such a transformation.

Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I'll make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

Wait, no. Because the product has a carbonyl, which would suggest that the starting material's epoxide is converted into a carbonyl. Looking back, the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7, which is a sharp singlet, so no coupling. That suggests a symmetrical structure, maybe (CH3)2CO.

But the starting material has a styryl group. So, perhaps the product is styrylacetone.

Alternatively, the correct option is B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Because when the ring opens, it forms a carbonyl with two methyl groups attached.

Wait, but the substituent in option B is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, which has a methyl group attached to the central carbon. So, upon ring opening, maybe the structure becomes a ketone with that methyl group and another from somewhere else.

Hmm, I'm still a bit uncertain, but based on the NMR data and the reaction conditions, the correct answer is likely option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Wait, no, because the product has a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Because upon reaction, the methyl and the styryl groups could form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which allows for the formation of a ketone upon ring opening.

After thinking through, I believe the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. But wait, earlier I thought the product has a carbonyl, which would require the starting material to be an epoxide that can form a carbonyl upon reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which upon reaction forms a ketone.

But considering the product's NMR data, which includes a carbonyl peak and two methyl singlets, I'm more inclined to think that the product is (CH3)2CO attached to a styryl group.

Looking back at the options, option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So, when this epoxide reacts, perhaps it forms a product with a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring opening, but under basic conditions, it's more of an elimination.

Wait, I'm running out of time. Based on the product's data, the correct starting material must be option D: 2-styrylepoxide.


The problem involves identifying the starting compound (Compound X) based on its reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane under specified conditions and the resulting product's NMR data. The product's 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra reveal key features, including a carbonyl group (δ 197.7 in 13C NMR), two methyl groups as singlets (δ 2.28 and 2.31 in 1H NMR), and aromatic protons suggesting a substituted benzene ring. The molecular formula of the starting material is C11H12O, and the reaction conditions suggest a transformation involving the epoxide group.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
   This compound has a styryl group (vinylbenzene) with a methyl substituent in the para position. However, its molecular formula does not match the starting material (C11H12O). Additionally, the reaction is unlikely to produce a carbonyl group from this structure.

2. **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
   This compound has a propenyl group with a phenyl substituent at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2. Its molecular formula matches the starting material (C11H12O). Upon reaction, the base could abstract a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring opening and the formation of a carbonyl group. This aligns with the product's NMR data, which includes a carbonyl peak and two methyl singlets.

3. **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
   This compound has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. While its molecular formula matches the starting material, the reaction is less likely to produce a carbonyl group due to the lack of a suitable substituent for elimination or rearrangement.

4. **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
   This compound has a styryl group (vinylbenzene) attached to the epoxide at position 2. Its molecular formula does not match the starting material (C11H12O). Additionally, the reaction is unlikely to produce a carbonyl group from this structure.

### Conclusion:
Based on the molecular formula, reaction conditions, and the product's NMR data, **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane** is the most plausible starting material. The reaction likely involves base-induced elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group and two methyl singlets in the product.

**Answer: B**
