Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits based on the spectra data.

Let me break down the given information. 

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Because it's a very broad peak, I'm thinking maybe it's a hydroxyl group because the broadening comes from hydrogen bonding or something like that.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or something else with a double bond nearby, or possibly an aromatic ring. Wait, or maybe it's a carbonyl in a conjugated system, like a conjugated ketone or maybe an amide? No, wait, amides usually have lower frequencies. Hmm. Alternatively, 1650 could be a double bond (like C=C) stretch, but that's usually around 1600-1680, but maybe in conjugation with something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a C-O stretch in an ester? Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a carbonyl next to a double bond, which could lower the wavenumber a bit. Hmm, not sure yet. But 1700 is a strong carbonyl, probably an ester or ketone or aldehyde.

Looking at the 1H NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond somewhere, or perhaps a conjugated system.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible ions at 45. For example, the CH3CO+ ion is 45 (since CH3CO+ is 12*2 +1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43? Wait, no, wait, the molecular formula of CH3CO is C2H3O, which would be 2*12=24, 3*1=3, 16=16. 24+3+16=43. So m/z 43. Hmm, but the fragment is 45. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHO+? Wait, what would that be? (CH3)2CHO has a formula of C3H7O, which is 3*12 +7 +16=36+7=43+16=59? Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2CH2O... Wait, maybe it's a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is C3H5O2+? Let me think: 3*12=36, 5*1=5, 16*2=32. Wait no, that adds up to 36+5+32=73. That's higher. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be CH2(CO) something. Alternatively, maybe a propionyl group? Or perhaps the fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's higher. Alternatively, think of common fragments. Another possibility is that 45 comes from a CH2CH2O group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an ester group, which might lead to a fragment of CH3COO- something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. Wait, 45 is 29 (CH2CH2) +16=45? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment that comes from cleavage between the carbonyl and the rest. For example, if the molecule is an ester, perhaps it's R-O-CO-O-R', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH3 group (29) plus an O (16), but 29 + 16 is 45? Wait, CH2CH3 is 29, but O is 16, so 29 + 16 =45? But then the fragment would be CH2CH3O+? Hmm, that might form a fragment of 45. Alternatively, perhaps it's the t-butyl group? No, that's 59.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and see which one would have a fragment of m/z 45.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So, all have six carbons. Let's calculate the molecular weights.

Option A: C6H12O2: (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) =72 +12 +32=116.

Option B: C6H10O: 72 +10 +
