Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are called enantiomers, and they can rotate plane-polarized light, hence the term optical isomers.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let me look at each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are in positions that allow for rotation around the central bond. Wait, but for biphenyls to have optical isomers, the substituents on each ring should be in positions that create a chiral center. Let me think. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents here are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and also 6,6' with nitro groups. Wait, maybe the positions of the substituents matter. If the substituents are in the same positions on both rings, then the molecule could be symmetric. But wait, if the two substituents are on opposite sides, perhaps leading to a non-superimposable mirror image. Alternatively, maybe this is a case of a meso compound or something else. Wait, biphenyls can exhibit cis-trans isomerism if the substituents are in positions where rotation is restricted. Oh, but wait, for optical isomerism, a molecule must have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry or something that allows for enantiomerism. So does this compound have a chiral center? Let me see. The substituents are on the benzene rings, but I don't see any carbon atoms attached to four different groups here. Wait, the central biphenyl structureâ€”maybe the central bond allows for some kind of stereoisomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 6 and 6' are in positions that make the molecule chiral. Wait, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides relative to the central bond, then maybe the molecule can have enantiomers. Or wait, if the substituents are symmetrical, like if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it wouldn't be
