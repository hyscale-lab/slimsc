Okay, I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product of this reaction sequence. Let me walk through each step carefully.

So, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, which is a bicyclic structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. The structure of norbornene has two double bonds, right? Wait, no, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, with one double bond. But the starting material is a diene, so maybe two double bonds?

Wait, the question says 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's norbornadiene with substituents. So positions 2 and 5 have double bonds. So the molecule has two double bonds in the norbornane structure.

Next step: it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Because norbornadiene is a diene, and cyclohexadiene with dibromomethyl groups would be the dienophile. Wait, the dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. Let me think.

The dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has two double bonds? Wait, no, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated double bonds, but that's a bit unusual since cyclohexadiene is not very common. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a diene (norbornadiene), and the other compound is a dienophile. So two equivalents of the dienophile reacting with the diene.

Wait, Diels-Alder
