Okay, so I have this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question asks how many of the listed stars would be detectable. A star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The stars are options a) to f), and the possible answers are A to D in the choices.

First, I need to understand what factors affect the S/N ratio in a spectrograph. From what I remember, S/N depends on factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the efficiency of the instrument, the telescope's collecting area, and perhaps the wavelength range or the number of pixels.

ESPRESSO is a spectrograph used with the VLT (8m telescopes). I remember that ESPRESSO is designed for high-resolution spectroscopy. The VLT has a large collecting area, so that should help in gathering more light.

The formula for calculating S/N is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / (noise), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, there's a formula that relates S/N with magnitude, exposure time, and some constants. I think the formula is S/N = (10^(-0.4*(m - m0))) * sqrt(t) * (some efficiency factor), where m is the apparent magnitude of the star, m0 is a reference magnitude (like a zero point), and t is exposure time.

Wait, m0 is the magnitude that would give a certain S/N. For example, if you have a star of magnitude m0, it would give a certain S/N in a certain time. For ESPRESSO, I should find out what the S/N is per pixel for a given magnitude and exposure time.

But I'm not exactly sure about the parameters of ESPRESSO. Let me recall. The ESPRESSO spectrograph has a high resolving power, which I think is about R=190,000 or something like that. High R means each spectral resolution element is narrow, which affects the number of photons collected per pixel. But the question says "binned pixel," so maybe they're referring to the number of pixels combined, which would increase the S/N.

But wait, for a given star, the apparent brightness (V magnitude) is critical. Each star's apparent magnitude determines how much light it emits per unit area, which in turn affects the S/N.

But I don't have the exact formula. Maybe I should think about how the distance affects the apparent magnitude. The absolute magnitude (M) is given for each star. The formula that relates absolute magnitude (M) to apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for each star, I can calculate m using their M and distance. Once I have m, I can figure out if S/N is above 10.

But what's the relationship between m and S/N? I think the S/N scales with the square root of the flux. Since flux is proportional to
