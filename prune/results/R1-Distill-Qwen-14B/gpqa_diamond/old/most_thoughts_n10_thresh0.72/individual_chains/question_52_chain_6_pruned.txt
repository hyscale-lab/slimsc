Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, so the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? I remember that spots are cooler regions on the star, so when they cover part of the surface, the overall brightness changes. Oh right, effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity, so if spots cover part, the star becomes dimmer overall.

The question then is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, so the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when spots are present. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But how does the temperature affect the ratio? Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, or is it (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*T) )? Because higher energy states have lower populations when the temperature is lower.

Wait, I think the correct form is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So for level 1 and level 2, if E2 > E1, then as T increases, n1/n2 would increase because the exponential becomes larger.

But let
