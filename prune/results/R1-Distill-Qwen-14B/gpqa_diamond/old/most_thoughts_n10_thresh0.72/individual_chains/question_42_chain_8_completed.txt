Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem involves three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're all in a system with circular orbits, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. I remember that TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by looking at changes in the timing of transits, which can be caused by the gravitational influence of other planets in the system.

The question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So, Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2, so if it's 1.4, that means Planet1 is hotter. Because the ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4, so T1 = 1.4 * T2. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3's equilibrium temperatures is about 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3, meaning T2 is 2.3 times T3. Therefore, Planet3 is colder than Planet2. So the order of their temperatures is Planet3 < Planet2 < Planet1.

Then, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2, but not by a huge amount. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 1.35, so M2/M3 = 1.35. Thus, Planet2 is more massive than Planet3.

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So, find P3/P1.

All three planets have the same albedo, which is 0.3, similar to Earth's. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because it determines how much light is reflected. Since it's the same for all three, it should cancel out when considering ratios.

I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's orbital distance, and the planet's albedo. The formula is T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4), where L is luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since all three planets orbit the same star, L and σ are constants. Albedos are the same, so when taking the ratio of temperatures, those terms will cancel.

So the ratio of temperatures (T1/T2) should be sqrt(sqrt( (D2^2)/(D1^2) )) ). Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is proportional to (L/(D^2))^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4). Since L and (1 - a) are the same for all, the temperature ratio depends on the inverse square root of the distance ratio. So T1/T2 = (D2 / D1)^(1/2). Similarly, T2/T3 = (D3 / D2)^(1/2).

Wait, no, because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4). So T ∝ (1/D²)^(1/4) = 1/D^(1/2). So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D). So if T1 is larger than T2, that implies D1 is smaller than D2. Because as you get closer, temperature increases.

So the temperature ratio is T1/T2 = (sqrt(D2/D1)) ) because:

T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, let me do it properly. Let me write the formula.

T = ( (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) )^(1/4)

So, T ∝ (1/D²)^(1/4) = 1/D^(1/2).

So T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, yes. Because (T1/T2) = ( (1/sqrt(D1)) ) / (1/sqrt(D2)) ) = sqrt(D2/D1).

So for the first ratio, T1/T2 = 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides: (D2/D1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Then, the second ratio is T2/T3 = 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring: D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

So now we can express D3 in terms of D1.

D2 = 1.96 * D1.

So D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1.

Let me compute 5.29 * 1.96. Let's see: 5 * 2 is 10, so approximately. Let's compute exactly.

1.96 * 5.29:

1.96 * 5 = 9.8

1.96 * 0.29 = let's compute that: 1.96 * 0.2 = 0.392, 1.96*0.09=0.1764. So total 0.392 + 0.1764 = 0.5684.

So 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684.

So D3 = 10.3684 * D1.

So D3 is about 10.368 times D1.

Now, orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. The law states that P² ∝ D³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. But wait, actually, the correct form is P² = (4π²/(G(M+planet masses))) * D³. But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the star, M is the star's mass. However, if the star's mass is the same for all, then the period is proportional to D^(3/2).

Wait, but in this problem, the planets have different masses. Hmm, but wait, when using Kepler's third law for planets orbiting the same star, the period depends on D and the star's mass. The mass of the planet doesn't significantly affect the period because the star's mass is so much larger. So for small planets, the period is given by P² = (4π² G M_star)^(-1) * D³.

But wait, actually, the exact formula is P² = (4π²/(G(M_star + M_planet))) * D³. But since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate it as P² ∝ D³ / M_star. But since all planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same for all, so P² ∝ D³. So P ∝ D^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2). Because P is proportional to D^(3/2).

So D3/D1 = 10.368. So (10.368)^(3/2) = ?

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute 10.368^1.5. Since 10.368 is approx 10.368, which is 10.368.

But maybe I should compute 10.368^(3/2) as the square root of 10.368^3.

Alternatively, let's compute it step by step.

First, compute 10.368 squared: 10.368^2 = approximately (10^2) + 2*10*0.368 + (0.368)^2.

Wait, 10.368 *10.368 = (10 + 0.368)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.368 + 0.368^2.

So 100 + 7.36 + (approx 0.135424) → 100 +7.36=107.36 + 0.135424 ≈ 107.4954.

Then, 10.368^3 is 10.368 * 107.4954 ≈ let's compute that.

10 * 107.4954 = 1074.954, 0.368 * 107.4954 ≈ 0.368 * 107 = approx 39.416. So total approx 1074.954 + 39.416 ≈ 1114.37.

So 10.368^3 ≈ 1114.37.

Then, sqrt(1114.37) → what's the square of 33? 33²=1089, 34²=1156. So sqrt(1114) is between 33 and 34.

Compute 33.4² = 33 *33= 1089, 2*(33)*(0.4)=26.4, 0.4²=0.16. So 1089 +26.4 +0.16= 1115.56. Wait, but 33.4 squared is 1115.56. Our value is 1114.37, which is a little less than 33.4².

So 33.4^2=1115.56, so 1114.37 is about 33.4^2 - 1.19.

So the square root would be approximately 33.4 minus some small amount. Let's think about it. The difference is 1.19.

The derivative of x² is 2x, so delta x ≈ (delta y) / (2x). So delta y is -1.19, x is 33.4. So delta x ≈ -1.19/(2*33.4) ≈ -1.19/66.8 ≈ approx -0.0178.

So sqrt(1114.37) ≈ 33.4 - 0.0178 ≈ 33.38.

So 10.368^(3/2) ≈ 33.38.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.38.

Wait, but let me check my approach again. Because Kepler's third law for planets in a star's system is given by the formula:

P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³

Where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star), M is the mass of the star.

So for two planets, P1 and P2, we have:

P1² = (4π²/G M) * a1³

P2² = same, but a2³.

Taking the ratio P2²/P1² = (a2³/a1³) → (P2/P1)² = (a2/a1)^3 → P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2).

In our case, D3 = 10.368 D1.

So P3 = (D3)^(3/2) * const, P1 = D1^(3/2) * const.

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.368)^(3/2) ≈ 33.38 as computed.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait a minute, but I should double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the ratios.

Let me recap:

The temperature ratios give us the distances.

T1/T2 = 1.4 → sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2=1.96.

So D2 = 1.96 D1.

Then, T2/T3=2.3 → sqrt(D3/D2)=2.3 → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2=5.29.

So D3 =5.29 D2 =5.29 *1.96 D1 = 5.29 *1.96= let's compute 5 *1.96 =9.8, 0.29 *1.96=0.5684. So total 10.3684 D1.

So D3 is 10.3684 D1.

Then, the periods: P^2 ∝ a^3, so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

As computed earlier, that's approximately 33.38, which is option D.

So the answer is D) ~33.4.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, given the equilibrium temperature ratios and mass ratios of three planets in a system. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. The mass ratios are 1.15 between Planet1 and Planet2, and 1.35 between Planet2 and Planet3. All planets have the same albedo (0.3).

### Step 1: Relating Temperature Ratios to Orbital Distances
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance. From the given temperature ratios:
1. \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) implies \( \sqrt{D_2 / D_1} = 1.4 \), so \( D_2 / D_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \). Thus, \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \).
2. \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) implies \( \sqrt{D_3 / D_2} = 2.3 \), so \( D_3 / D_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \). Thus, \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \).

Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \), we find:
\[
D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 = 10.3684 D_1.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Periods to Orbital Distances
Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( D^{3/2} \), i.e., \( P \propto D^{3/2} \). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_3 / P_1 \) is given by:
\[
P_3 / P_1 = (D_3 / D_1)^{3/2}.
\]
Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 = 10.3684 \), we compute:
\[
P_3 / P_1 = (10.3684)^{3/2}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \)
To compute \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \):
1. First, calculate \( 10.3684^2 = 107.4954 \).
2. Then, calculate \( 10.3684^3 = 10.3684 \times 107.4954 \approx 1114.37 \).
3. Finally, take the square root: \( \sqrt{1114.37} \approx 33.38 \).

Thus, \( P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.38 \).

### Step 4: Matching to the Options
The closest option to \( 33.38 \) is **D) ~33.4**.

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1.

Answer: D
