Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with gene constructs, expression, and some microscopy results. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there's a new ligand-receptor pair found in neural crest cells, and we're trying to understand their developmental roles. The question revolves around a bicistronic vector they've created and some experiments done with it.

So, the vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. But wait, there are some stop cassettes in between.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it can excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed.

So the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, but I think it's constitutive, meaning it's always active. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated as a separate ORF without needing a second promoter. So the ligand and receptor are both on the same transcript but are separate proteins.

Then, they made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression on a Western blot. They saw signals proportional to actin, which probably means the loading control is fine. But when they use the mouse model, which is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, and cross it with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see green under the confocal. So eGFP isn't lighting up.

Wait, the construct's expression is under the control of Cre. SOX10-Cre mice are used because SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, right? So the Cre should be active in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes, which are derived from the neural crest.

In the vector, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive. But the receptor is under the control of the IRES. So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both ligand and receptor expression. Oh, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the ligand is at the 5' end, followed by a stop in loxP cassette. So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed (since the promoter is CBA and the ORF is before the stop). But the receptor's ORF is after the IRES. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP. But the stop cassettes are in between the ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the stop would block expression beyond the ligand and mCherry, and similarly for receptor and eGFP.

But when Cre is introduced (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), it should excise the stop cassettes. So the ligand-mCherry should be expressed as a fusion, and the receptor-eGFP as another fusion. But in the Western blot, they saw expression, so the antibodies must have detected the proteins. But in the mouse model, when they cross with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't showing up under the microscope.

Hmm. So why isn't the eGFP expressed? Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how would that affect the expression of the GFP? I'm not sure. Maybe this is about whether the proteins are secreted or membrane-bound, but the question doesn't mention anything about secretion.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would that happen only in the mouse model? The Western blot detected the proteins, which suggests they're made, but maybe not trafficked correctly. But would the eGFP be expressed?

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the construct uses the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. So enhancers might not be a big issue here. Unless the promoter isn't active in the cells they're looking at, but the Western blot suggests the proteins are expressed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, right. If the ORF is not in frame after the stop cassette is removed, the reading frame could be messed up. So when the stop is removed, the receptor may be expressed but perhaps as a nonfunctional truncated protein. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is out of frame, so it's not expressed.

Wait, the vector is set up so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed. So the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP. But if in the case of the receptor-eGFP, the stop cassette uses a different lox site (lox2272), and the construct is such that without proper recombination, the eGFP is not expressed.

Wait,
