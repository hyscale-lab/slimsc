Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that when dealing with velocities and frames of reference, especially in relativity, it's all about how different observers see the same event. But wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, that probably means we can use classical mechanics for this problem because if they're inertial, maybe relativity effects like length contraction or time dilation aren't too significant here. Or maybe they are? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem gives the velocity from the ejecta's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That means from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, right? Because in classical terms, velocities are relative. Oh wait, no, that's not correct in special relativity because velocities don't just add up linearly when you switch frames. But I'm not sure if relativity applies here because the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So, relativistic
