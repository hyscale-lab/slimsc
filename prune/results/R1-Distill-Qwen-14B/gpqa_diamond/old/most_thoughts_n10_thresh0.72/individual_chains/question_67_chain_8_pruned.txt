Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. I remember that p orbitals have a principal quantum number l equal to 1, right? So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, let me think. So l here is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. Oh wait, that's the combined angular momentum of the two electrons. So when you combine two l=1 particles, the possible total l values are l = |1-1| to 1+1, so 0, 1, 2. Oh, right, so in this case, the state is for l=2 and m=-1. So the total angular momentum is 2, and the z-component is -1 times ħ.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. So each electron's angular momentum along the z-axis is -ħ.

Wait a second, each electron's orbital angular momentum has possible m values of -1, 0, +1. So m for each is from -1 to +1. So if we're measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ, that would mean each electron has m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But the total state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So how does that relate to the individual m values? Hmm. The state is a coupled state, meaning it's expressed in terms of the total angular momentum quantum numbers. To find the individual m's, I think we have to break this state down into the product states of the individual electrons' m1 and m2.

Wait, but in the coupled basis, the state |l1, l2, l, m> is built from the possible combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m. So in this case, m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

We're looking for the case where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because each L1z is m1 * ħ and L2z is m2 * ħ. So if both are -1, then m1 = m2 = -1, summing to m = -2. But wait, the state has m = -1. So that's conflicting.

Wait a minute, because the total m is -1. So if each electron's m is -1, the sum would be -2, which doesn't match the state's m of -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> can't have both m1 and m2 equal to -1 because that would sum to m = -2, but the state has m = -1.

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ must be zero. Because the state has total m = -1, which can't result from both m1 and m2 being -1. 

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, another way to approach this is to consider the possible states that make up the |l=2, m=-1> state. Since the coupling is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>, I need to find the expansion of this state in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. Because the state |l=2, m=-1> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (0, -1), (1, -2?) No, wait, no. Each m can be -1, 0, +1. So for m1 + m2 = -1, the possible pairs are:

m1 = 0, m2 = -1

m1 = -1, m2 = 0

Wait, because m1 can't be less than -1. So those are the only two possible combinations. So the state |2,-1> is a combination of |0, -1> and |-1, 0>.

So in the coupled state, when we express it in terms of the product states, it would be a superposition of these two product states.

So the expansion would be something like |2,-1> = a |0, -1> + b |-1, 0>, where a and b are coefficients. I think the coefficients can be determined from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something similar.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I
