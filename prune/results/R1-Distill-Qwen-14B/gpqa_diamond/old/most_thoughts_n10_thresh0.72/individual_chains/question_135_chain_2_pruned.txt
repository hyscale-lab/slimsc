Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about boson decay. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but I'm not sure how that plays into the decay modes directly. Maybe it's more about the coupling between X and the fermions.

Wait, the Lagrangian term looks like it's a Yukawa interaction. So the boson X couples to fermions. The general form for such an interaction is something like L ~ g X ψ ψ, where g is the coupling constant. So the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into would be those that the interaction term allows.

But the key here is kinematics. The decay must be allowed by energy conservation. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. So X can decay into a pair of fermions f and f-bar only if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's think about the masses of known fermions. Let's list the fermion masses:

Electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV.
Muon (μ): around 0.105 GeV.
Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV.
Up quark (u): ~2 MeV, so 0.002 GeV.
Down quark (d): ~4 MeV, 0.004 GeV.
Strange (s): ~95 MeV, 0.095 GeV.
Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV.
Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV.
Top (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks since 2*m_t is 346 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV.

So, X is 6 GeV. Let's see which fermions are possible. For each fermion f, 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV.

Let's go through each option:

Electron (e): 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV → allowed.
Muon (μ): 2m_mu ≈ 0.21 GeV → allowed.
Tau (τ): 2m_tau ≈ 3.56 GeV → allowed.
Up (u): 2m_u ≈ 0.004 GeV → allowed.
Down (d): 2m_d ≈ 0.008 GeV → allowed.
Strange (s): 2m_s ≈ 0.19 GeV → allowed.
Charm (c): 2m_c ≈ 2.55 GeV → allowed.
Bottom (b): 2m_b ≈9 GeV → which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but wait, 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is greater than 6 GeV. So the allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, and c.

So looking at the decay options, each option lists possible fermion pairs. Let's check each option.

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.
But b's mass is too high, so this option includes b, which is impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
Wait, c c-bar: 2m_c is about 2.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed. But what about b? Oh, no, option B doesn't include b. So all the fermions in B have 2m_f ≤6 GeV except perhaps if I missed any.

Wait, let me check: c is allowed, tau is allowed (3.56 GeV is less than 6), mu is allowed, e is allowed, u, d, s are allowed. So all are allowed except no b. So option B includes c, which is correct since 2m_c is less than 6 GeV. So B's decay channels are all allowed except, wait, what's about the fermions' masses.

Wait, another point: the coupling in the Lagrangian. The interaction term is -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So
