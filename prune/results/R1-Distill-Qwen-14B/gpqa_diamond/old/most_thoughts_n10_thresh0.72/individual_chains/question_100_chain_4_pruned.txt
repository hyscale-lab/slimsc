Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction sequences can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, that's a three-carbon compound. The possible structures for C3H6 are either propene (an alkene) or cyclopropane, but I think propene is more likely here because the next step is bromination in CCl4. Oh wait, bromination of alkenes is typically via addition, so if A is propene, then adding bromine would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Or wait, maybe it's 1-bromopropane? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. Yeah, that makes sense.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, probably leading to an E2 elimination. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane, which when treated with alcoholic KOH would eliminate HBr twice, forming an alkene. Wait, what's the structure? So for 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination can occur between the two adjacent Br atoms. So, losing two HBr molecules would form propene again? Or maybe a different alkene.

Wait, if B is
