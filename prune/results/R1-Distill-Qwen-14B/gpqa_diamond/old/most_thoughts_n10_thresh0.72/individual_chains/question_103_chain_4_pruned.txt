Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's see what the target molecule looks like.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, breaking that down, the phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 and 5. The 3 position has a bromo group, and the 5 position has a nitro group. Additionally, the ethan-1-one part means there's a ketone group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO connected to the ring. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a ketone (acetophenone-like) at position 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5.

Wait, wait. Let me draw the benzene ring. The numbering would have the ketone at position 1, then bromo at 3 (which is two positions away from 1 in the ortho position), and nitro at 5 (which is meta to the ketone). So, the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, that would mean they're all in a meta arrangement relative to each other, but with the ketone at 1. So the substituents are at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3). So the ring has three substituents.

But wait, benzene is symmetric, so the actual positions are determined by the order of substitution. So the main point is that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So I need to figure out the order of adding these substituents. I remember that when you have multiple substituents, the order in which they're introduced affects the product because of the directing effects of the substituents.

Nitration is a meta-directing reaction when the substituent is a strong meta director, like a nitro group. Wait, but nitration is usually done with HNO3 and H2SO4, and nitro
