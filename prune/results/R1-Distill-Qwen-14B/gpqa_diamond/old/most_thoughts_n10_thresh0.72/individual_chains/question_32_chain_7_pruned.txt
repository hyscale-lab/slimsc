Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that must be Li-6 because the atomic number is 3 (protons) plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

So, the nucleus in question is Li-6. I need to find the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. Wait, but the question is about the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy given here would be the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this. Wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. But sometimes, for high-energy particles, the kinetic energy is a significant fraction of the total. But I should probably double-check.

First, let's get the basics. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma times mc². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed here is 0.96c, v=0.96c.

So, let me calculate gamma first. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c² = 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714 approximately. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.0784 is 784/10000 = 49*16/10000. Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784
