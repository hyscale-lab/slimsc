Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic substitution reaction when certain substituents are attached to a benzene ring. The compounds given are 1 to 6, each with different substituents. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction (yield) of the para-isomer.

Right, so I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring towards electrophilic attack. Also, substituents can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions: either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, activating groups are usually electron-donating, which make the ring more reactive. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive. And the directing effect depends on whether the substituent is an activating or deactivating group. 

So the substituents here are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethy, but wait, no, the structure is C6H5-C2H5, which is ethylbenzene? Or wait, maybe it's benzyl ethyl? No, the formula is C6H5-C2H5, which would be ethylbenzene, so the substituent is ethyl (CH2CH3). So a big alkyl group.
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Let me list each substituent and their activating/deactivating and directing effects.

1) CH3 (methyl): This is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. It's a strong activating group. It's ortho/para directing because the methyl donates electrons via induction, activating those positions.

2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl group): The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, but the oxygen is connected to an ethoxy group. Wait, ethoxycarbonyl is an ester group. Esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive. But wait, wait, the ester group is a meta director. Because the carbonyl is deactivating, but the lone pairs on the oxygen are in the plane, maybe? Or wait, the ester is an electron-withdrawing group by resonance but can donate electrons through the ether part? Hmm, I think that's not correct. Wait, no. The ester group is an activating or deactivating? Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: substituents that can donate electrons through resonance activate the ring. Electron-withdrawing groups deacitvate. Esters (like COOR) are deactivating because the carbonyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group. But wait, the oxygen in the ester group (the ether part) has lone pairs. But the overall effect is deactivating. So ester
