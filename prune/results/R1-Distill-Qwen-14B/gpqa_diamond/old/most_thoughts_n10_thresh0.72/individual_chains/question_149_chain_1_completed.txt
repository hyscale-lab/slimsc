Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question. Hmm, let's see what the problem is.

So, the scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what we expect, except for two peaks that are from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and the integrals add up to one H, which is the expected amount. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason for the double peaks. So, the same proton must be splitting into two without coupling to another proton. Interesting.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So, same mass, so same molecular weight, same structure perhaps? But why two peaks?

The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different molecular weight, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction. If the LC-MS shows same mass, it's probably not a precursor. Unless maybe the precursor lost something, but I'm not sure. But since the mass is the same as the expected, maybe not.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, non-superimposable. In NMR, enantiomers would show the same spectrum because the environment is the same for each proton. Wait, that can't be right because if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same peaks as a single enantiomer. But wait, in the NMR, there are two peaks for the same alpha proton. So if it's a racemic mixture, would that cause splitting? Maybe not, because each enantiomer would have identical alpha H environments, so the NMR wouldn't split. Hmm, maybe this isn't it.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Wait, the question says we can rule out spin-spin coupling. So, maybe during the amide bond formation, some double coupling like maybe from an intermediate? Or perhaps a side reaction where the proton is coupled to two different types of protons, but I'm not entirely sure how that would work. Or maybe it's a case where the amide is forming, and during the reaction, the alpha protons are coupling in a way that causes two signals. But since the NMR doesn't show coupling, that's probably not it.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. For an alpha proton, if the compound is a diastereomer, the environment would be different, leading to different shifts. But in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts and integral adds up to 1H. So, maybe if the structure has two diastereomers, each with the same alpha environment. Wait, but diastereomers usually have different environments. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a case where the molecule has some sort of conformational issue, or perhaps a pair of diastereomers where the alpha proton is in the same environment. Or maybe the molecule is not fully formed and has some stereocenters that are variable, but that would usually lead to more than two signals. Or perhaps it's a case of epimers, which are a type of diastereomers differing in the configuration of one stereocenter. But then, two diastereomers would have different shifts.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. The integrals add up to 1H, so it's not like each peak is integrating to 0.5. So the total is 1H, but two peaks. So what if the molecule has two different diastereomeric forms, each having the same alpha H. But if they're diastereomers, the alpha H would be in a different environment, leading to different shifts. But in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts, so maybe their environments are not too different. Hmm, maybe like if the diastereomers have the same or very similar alpha proton environments.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is actually a single enantiomer, but the NMR is showing something else. Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks. If it's a racemic mixture, the LC would have two peaks, but the NMR would not split. So that doesn't fit with the NMR observation. Wait, because in the NMR, if it's a racemic mixture, the peaks would look the same. So why are there two peaks in the NMR? So option B is probably not right.

Wait, but the NMR is showing two peaks for the same alpha proton, but the same integral. So it's like two different peaks but integrating to 1H total. So perhaps there are two different environments for that same proton, but in the same molecule? Or perhaps it's a case where the proton is split into two due to coupling, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so that's not it.

Hmm, LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass. So same molecular formula but different structures? But same molecular weight, same mass spectrum. So same molecular weight but different structures. Wait, but same mass spectrum? Same molecular ion? So same molecular weight, but different structures. Hmm, perhaps isomers.

If it's diastereomers, then their mass spec would be the same because they have the same molecular weight. So in the LC-MS, they would elute at different times because their structures are different, leading to different retention times. So the two peaks would have same mass (same molecular weight) but would be different structures.

So the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. Wait, but if the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, each would have the same alpha proton in same or different environments. If the diastereomers have the same environment for that alpha proton, their shifts would be same. But then, why two peaks? Because each diastereomer contributes a peak. So the same alpha proton would be in same environment, but if the diastereomers have the same shift, then the NMR would show a single peak, but with maybe a larger integral. Hmm, but the integral is correct, 1H. So maybe the diastereomers each have the same shift, but that's not typical.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is with the synthesis. Like maybe there was an issue where the molecule hasn't fully formed, leading to some isomerism. Or perhaps it's a case of conformers, but that usually doesn't split peaks in such a way.

Wait, another possibility: the amide bond formation could lead to some double bonds or other structures that cause some splitting. Wait, the option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. But the question said the coupling pattern can't explain it. So perhaps during the reaction, some double coupling, like maybe a geminal coupling or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a racemic mixture, but that doesn't explain the NMR. Because the NMR of a racemic mixture would not have two peaks for the same proton. So that's probably not.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Since the integrals add up to 1H, perhaps the molecule is actually a single enantiomer but has some sort of dynamic process causing the peak to split. Or perhaps it's some sort of exchange between environments, but that's more for NOE or something else. Maybe it's a case of a proton being in two different environments, but that would be more like an average in the NMR. Not sure.

Alternatively, the problem could involve isotopologues or something else, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So same molecular weight, but different structures. So perhaps the compound is a diastereomer, leading to two distinct structures with same mass. So the NMR would show different shifts for diastereomers, but in this case, the two shifts are similar. Hmm, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, which would suggest that the alpha H is in two different environments. So that might not fit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option B: Enantiomers. LC-MS would show two peaks, same molecular weight, same mass spec. The NMR would show same peaks because the environment is same for each enantiomer. So why are there two peaks in the NMR? That's a contradiction. So probably not.

Option D: Diastereomers. So LC-MS would show two peaks, same mass. NMR would show different peaks because each diastereomer has different environments. But in the NMR, the same alpha proton has two peaks with similar shifts. So perhaps the diastereomers have the same or similar environments for that proton. But that's not impossible. Wait, for example, if the diastereomerism is in a position away from the alpha H, perhaps the shift isn't too different. So the two diastereomers each have their own alpha H environments, leading to two peaks, but with similar shifts.

But if the two diastereomers have the same alpha H environment, then the NMR would show a single peak, but in this case, it's two. So maybe the diastereomers have slightly different environments, leading to two close peaks. That could be the case.

Wait, but if the integral adds up to 1H, then maybe each diastereomer has the same number of alpha H, which they would because they are isomers. So each diastereomer contributes 0.5H? But the integral for each is similar. So that could fit.

So the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha H, but each diastereomer has the same alpha H, but in slightly different environments, leading to similar shifts. So the two diastereomers contribute two peaks, each integrating to 0.5H, but together it's 1H. But wait, that would mean that each diastereomer has an alpha H. But if the molecule is a diastereomer, the same molecule would have the same number of protons. Wait, perhaps the molecule has two stereocenters, and each diastereomer exists in the mixture, each with their own alpha H environments, leading to two peaks in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diastereomer with an alpha H that's in a different environment because of the stereocenters elsewhere.

Hmm, but why would the LC-MS have two peaks? Because the diastereomers have different retention times. So if the crude compound is a mixture of diastereomers, you'll get two peaks. Each would have the same mass (same molecular formula), so same mass spec.

So putting it together, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha H because there are two diastereomers, each with a similar but shifted environment for that H. The LC-MS shows two peaks because they are diastereomers with different retention times but same mass.

So the most likely option is D) Mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but another thought: Option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond forming. But the question says coupling is ruled out. So that's not the case.

So the best fit is D.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (totaling 1H), and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Additionally, LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would typically have a different molecular weight and mass spectrum compared to the expected product. Since the LC-MS shows the same mass and mass spectrum as the expected molecule, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images, but they have identical chemical environments for all protons, including the alpha-proton. Therefore, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two peaks. This contradicts the observed NMR data, making this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the explanation for the duplicate peaks. Additionally, "double coupling" during amide bond formation is not a typical explanation for the observed NMR and LC-MS data. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, including NMR shifts, due to differences in their spatial arrangements. If the mixture contains two diastereoisomers with similar environments for the alpha-proton, their NMR signals would appear as two peaks with similar chemical shifts. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, supports the presence of two distinct isomeric forms. This explanation aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for the duplicate NMR peaks and the two LC-MS peaks with the same mass.
