Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. That makes sense; these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So let me try to write down what this matrix looks like.

Since the state is in a two-dimensional space (because it's expressed in terms of |up> and |down>), the matrix A is 2x2. The diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0  ]

Wait, but I should double-check. If i and j are row and column indices, then for a 2x2 matrix, A12 and A21 are ħ/2, and A11 and A22 are zero. That seems correct.

Now, the task is to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of this operator A. So I think I need to diagonalize matrix A because the eigenstates of A are the states into which the system will collapse upon measurement.

Let me write down the matrix A again:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, but when I write this matrix, I should note that ħ is h-bar, which is a constant. But in any case, to diagonalize A, I'll need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues λ are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix (A - λI) is:

[ -λ    ħ/2  ]
[ ħ/2   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Therefore, the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors can be found for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λI) v = 0 → [ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [a]   = 0
                [ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [b]

So the first equation is (-ħ/2) a + (ħ/2) b = 0 → -a + b = 0 → b = a.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1, 1]^T. But to normalize, we can write it as (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

The matrix becomes [ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
                [ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute. The matrix (A - (-ħ/2) I) is:

[ (ħ/2)   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    (ħ/2) ]

So the equations are (ħ/2) a + (ħ/2) b = 0 → a + b = 0 → b = -a.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1, -1]^T, normalized to (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of A are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the measurement probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state |alpha> is projected onto these eigenstates.

But wait, first, the given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I need to normalize |alpha> first.

Let me compute the normalization factor. Let me denote |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) + cross terms.

Wait, but wait: The inner product is <alpha|alpha> = (1-i)(2+i) (from |up> and |down> terms) ?

Wait no, wait. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So the inner product is:

(1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So let me compute each term. (1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 + (i)(-i) + i(1) + (-i)(1) → Wait, actually, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So (1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the total norm squared is 2 + 5 = 7.

So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> divided by sqrt(7), because the norm is sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to compute the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, which are |eigen1> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |eigen2> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

The probability for each eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |alpha> and the eigenstate.

So let me compute <eigen1| alpha> and <eigen2| alpha>.

First, <eigen1| alpha> is [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The inner product is (1+i + 2 -i ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, no, let's do this step by step.

The inner product <eigen1 | alpha> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

The coefficients come from the inner product:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and the cross terms are zero because |up> and |down> are orthogonal.

So it simplifies to:

(1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Adding (1+i) and (2 -i): 1+2 =3, i -i =0 → 3.

So <eigen1 | alpha> = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is |3/(sqrt(14))|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, compute <eigen2 | alpha>.

<eigen2 | alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Since <up|down> and <down|up> are zero.

So this becomes (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) - (2 -i) → 1-2 +i +i → (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571...

Wait, but that's (5/14) ≈ 0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357). Wait, but wait, 9 +5 is 14, so that adds up to 1.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which aligns with 9/14≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357. So the first part's probabilities would be 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, so the probabilities are approximately 64.3% and 35.7%.

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → which would be 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So that's matching option A's first two numbers.

Wait, but wait, I need to double-check the inner product calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate <eigen1 | alpha> again.

<eigen1 | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) * (1/sqrt(7)) ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> )

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2-i) *1 ]

Since <up|up> is 1, <up|down> is 0, <down|up> is 0, <down|down> is 1.

So (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 → 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the inner product is 3/sqrt(14), magnitude squared is 9/14.

Similarly, <eigen2 | alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) * (1/sqrt(7)) ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> )

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)*1 - (2 -i)*1 ]

= (1 +i -2 +i )/(sqrt(14)) → (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 = 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which aligns with option A's first two numbers, 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the next part is to find the average value of the operator A.

The average value is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, another approach is to express A in the basis of |up> and |down>, which it already is, and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, since A has eigenstates |eigen1> and |eigen2> with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, the average would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So the average value is P1*(ħ/2) + P2*(-ħ/2).

Where P1 is 9/14 and P2 is 5/14.

So average = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) * ħ ] / (2*14) ) → (4 ħ)/(28) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches this result.

But wait, let me double-check: Another way to compute the expectation value is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Given that A is represented as the matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7). So in vector form, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

So when we compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by A multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Which is (1/sqrt(7))^2 times the dot product.

Compute the matrix multiplication:

A * |alpha> vector is:

A |alpha> = [ [0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7), [ (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) ]

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think in terms of matrices.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha> as follows.

The expectation value is (1/7) times [ (1-i) (2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) ] * ħ/2.

Wait, because:

The matrix A has elements A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_11 = A_22 =0.

So when you compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's:

(1/7) [ (1-i) * (A_12) * (2-i) ) + (2+i) * (A_21) * (1+i) ) ]

Because only the off-diagonal terms contribute.

So each term is (1-i)(2-i) * (ħ/2) + (2+i)(1+i) * (ħ/2).

Wait, actually, I think I should write it as:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ (1-i) * (ħ/2) * (2+i) + (2+i) * (ħ/2) * (1-i) ) ]

Wait, that's because when you multiply the row vector by the matrix and then by the column vector, the diagonal terms (i=j) would involve A_ii, which are zero, so only the i≠j terms contribute.

So each term is A_ij multiplied by the i-th row of <alpha| and the j-th component of |alpha>.

So the first term is A_12 * (1-i) * (2-i), which is (ħ/2) * (1-i)(2-i).

The second term is A_21 * (2+i) * (1+i), which is (ħ/2) * (2+i)(1+i).

So the sum is (ħ/2) [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ] multiplied by (1/7).

Let me compute each product.

Compute (1 - i)(2 - i):

= 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 (since i²=-1)
= 1 -3i.

Wait, let's compute it again:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²

i² is -1, so:

= 2 -3i + (-1) = 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i + i + i²
= 2 + 3i -1
= 1 + 3i.

So adding the two products: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So now, the expectation is (ħ/2) * 2 * (1/7) → (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which matches what I found earlier. So the average value is ħ/7.

So looking back at the options, which option has probabilities 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and average hbar/7.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are found by diagonalizing the matrix. The eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|eigen1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |eigen2\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \), the norm is calculated as:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |eigen1\rangle \) and \( |eigen2\rangle \) are determined by projecting \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto these eigenstates. The inner products are:

\[
\langle eigen1 | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle eigen2 | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(eigen1) = \left| \langle eigen1 | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(eigen2) = \left| \langle eigen2 | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

The average value of the operator \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(eigen1) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(eigen2) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, the probabilities \( \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \) and \( \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36 \), along with the average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \), match the values in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
