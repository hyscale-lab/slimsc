Okay, so I've got this problem here about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me look at the given data.

First, the masses of the stars are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, I'm not sure if the masses directly affect the abundance ratios here. The problem seems to be more about the given elemental abundance measurements, so maybe the masses are just extra info or maybe they don't play a role. I'll keep that in mind but perhaps focus on the abundances.

The given abundances are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star 1.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star 2.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star 1.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star 2.

We also have the solar photospheric composition:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12 =-5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5)

Wait, but do I need to use that? Let me think.

The goal is to find the ratio [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2], or wait, the ratio of silicon atoms in Star1 and Star2. So [Si]_1 / [Si]_2?

Wait, no. The problem says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2) ?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2], but the way the question is phrased, using the "ratio of silicon atoms" might just be their numbers per unit.

But how do I calculate that
