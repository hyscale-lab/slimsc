Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully and try to break it down.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Let me start by analyzing each piece of data one by one and see what they tell me about the compound.

First, the FTIR spectrum. A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but more specifically, a very broad peak could be from an -OH group, maybe in an alcohol or a phenol. Alternatively, maybe an amide? But the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 

1700 is a strong peak, which typically corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. Then 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower. Could that be conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ring with a carbonyl? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, such as in a ketone with some resonance. Alternatively, maybe an amide, but that's usually around 1650. Wait, but amide I bands are around 1640-1680, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

So the IR suggests the presence of an O-H group (broad peak) and a carbonyl group (1700 and 1650). Wait, two carbonyl peaks? That's a bit confusing. Or maybe the 1650 is something else. Alternatively, maybe 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is something else, like an aromatic ring with conjugation or an amide.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Because aromatic
