Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and that causes the spectral lines to shift wavelengths periodically.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #1 and #2 respectively. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. Oh right, the formula I remember is related to the semi-amplitude of the RV signal. The formula is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) ) 

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/ ) ... Hmm, perhaps I should look for a simpler approach.

Wait, another approach: the RV method's signal strength depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The Doppler shift (K) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me recall the formula.

The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (
