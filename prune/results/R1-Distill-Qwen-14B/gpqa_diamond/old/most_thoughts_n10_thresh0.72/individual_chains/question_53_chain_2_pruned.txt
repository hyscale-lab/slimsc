Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So that means the ring has two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so the IR peak around 1700 cm^-1 probably indicates that.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me break them down. The first two are aromatic H, so the ring has substituents that cause the aromatic protons to split into two signals. Maybe they're in different environments. Then there are two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, and another is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually on double bonds, like in an ester group. Oh wait, esters have an R-O-CO-O-R structure? Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. So the structure would be something like Ar-O-CO-R, but wait, no, that's an ester. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Ester is an acyloxy group, so like R-O-CO-R', right?

Wait, the substituents on the aromatic ring... If it's an ester, perhaps one substituent is an ester group. Let's think about the structure.

The NMR has two signals for aromatic H. That suggests that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern could be para, meta, or ortho. If it's para, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent H. For example, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two H environments, each with two protons. Wait, no, if it's para substitution, each substituent is opposite, so the ring would have two sets of equivalent H. Wait, for example, if substituents are para, then the ring's Hs are in two sets of two each, so two triplets or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the
