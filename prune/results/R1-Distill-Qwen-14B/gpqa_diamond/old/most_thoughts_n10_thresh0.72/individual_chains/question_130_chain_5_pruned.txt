Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space and how they absorb light from background quasars. Specifically, the absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that redshift is a key concept in cosmology. When an object is moving away from us, the light it emits gets redshifted. The formula I think I need here is the redshift formula related to wavelengths. I recall that the observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to the emitted wavelength (lambda_emit) multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z).

In this case, the emitted wavelength is the Lyman alpha emission, which is 1216 Angstroms. But wait, the clouds are absorbing this light, so they are at a certain redshift. The quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, which is a foreground object from our perspective. So the quasar would be behind the cloud, right? Or wait, no, the cloud is in the path between us and the quasar, so when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the hydrogen absorbs it at the Lyman alpha wavelength. So the quasar's light is at a longer wavelength (since it's coming from a higher redshift object) than what the cloud can absorb.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud. So from our point of view, the wavelength we observe would be longer if the cloud is moving away (i.e., redshifted). So the observed wavelength would be 1216 * (1 + z_cloud), where z_cloud is the redshift of the hydrogen cloud.

But wait, the quasars themselves are at some redshift. The clouds are in front of the quasars, so the quasar's light is
