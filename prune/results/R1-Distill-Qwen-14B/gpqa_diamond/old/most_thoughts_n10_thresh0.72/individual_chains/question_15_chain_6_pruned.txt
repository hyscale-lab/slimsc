Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to detect their transits, but they have limited time, so they need to choose the one with the higher probability of transiting. 

Both planets were detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, right, the RV method gives us the mass in terms of a minimum because the inclination isn't known. But for transit detection, the inclination plays a big role because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view.

The planets have the same masses. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter period means a smaller orbit. Also, both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things.

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But wait, both stars have the same radii. That's a bit confusing. More massive stars are usually bigger, but in this case, they're the same size. Maybe Planet_2's star is older or evolved, which might affect its radius differently. Oh, the question says the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so maybe that's why their radii are the same despite the mass difference.

The probability of a planet transiting is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability (P) is given by the formula P = R_star / (a * (1 + (M_planet/M_star)^0.5)) ), but wait, maybe I should think again. Oh, no, I think the formula for the transit probability is P = (R_star / (a)) / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^0.5) ), but wait, another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) divided by (1 + sqrt(M_p/M_s)), but wait, no, let's get it right.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability is calculated as (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_s)^(1/3)))?), or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, another approach: the probability is roughly (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + e)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's (R*/a) * 1. Wait, no, that's not right because you have to consider the Hill sphere or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for transit probability. The probability that a planet transits is given by:

P = (R_star / a) / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is P = (R*/a) * (1 + (M_p/M_s)^(1/3)) )^{-1}.

Wait, another approach: the probability is primarily the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance (a), adjusted by the mass ratio. Because for a planet to transit, it must be in a
