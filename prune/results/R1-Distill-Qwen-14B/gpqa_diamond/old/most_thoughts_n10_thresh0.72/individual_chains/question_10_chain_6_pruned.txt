Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, the question is asking which among the options has the highest density. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to remember what density is. Oh right, density is mass divided by volume. So the formula is density = mass/volume. Since volume is three-dimensional, it's proportional to the radius cubed, assuming the planet is a sphere. So if I have two planets where one is bigger than the other, its volume increases with the cube of the radius. But wait, mass might not scale the same way unless the density is the same.

Looking at the options:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is made of rock and metal. So this one has the same density as Earth.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait wait, that's given directly. So its density is 5.5. Hmm, same as Earth's. So same as option a.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition means same density, right? Because composition determines density. So if it's same as Earth, then its density is 5.5. But wait, if it's more massive, how's the radius affected? Well, if the mass increases by 5 times, and density is constant
