Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what information I've got. The question involves Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should give me clues about the structure.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But the presence of a strong peak around 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group—maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, Compound X probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a broad peak and perhaps exchange broadening, it could also be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH.

Wait, but wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and can be around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 fits that. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, but then the integration is 1H. Let me think. If it's a carboxylic acid, then there's a carbonyl, which would fit the IR peak at 1720 (carboxylic acids usually have strong peaks around 1700). But wait, another possibility is an ester or ketone. Let me not jump to conclusions yet.

Other NMR signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for para-substituted aromatic protons. Each doublet has 2H, so it's likely a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. Since the carbonyl is present, maybe it's a benzoic acid or an ester.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet. Could this be a methylene or a methine adjacent to an electronegative atom, like in a carbonyl group? Or maybe a CH next to an aromatic ring.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe a CH2 group, perhaps part of an ethyl chain or adjacent to another group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet? No, wait, it's a doublet. Wait, a doublet for 3H could be a CH3 attached to something that splits it into a doublet.
