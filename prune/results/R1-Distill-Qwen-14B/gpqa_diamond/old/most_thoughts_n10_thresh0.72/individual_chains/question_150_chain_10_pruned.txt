Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is and what information I have to go on.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. Wait, wait, no, the formula is DoU = (2n + 2 - m - x - p)/2. Let me plug in the numbers. n is 8, m is 9, x is 1 (since O is 1), p is 1 (N is 1). So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18 -11)/2 = 7/2=3.5. That doesn't make sense because DoU has to be an integer. Did I count wrong?

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, O is one, N is one. So substituting into the formula: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18-11)/2 = 7/2. Hmm, that can't be right because you can't have half a degree. Maybe I made a mistake with the formula. Wait, maybe I should think again. Oh wait, maybe it's (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. So for this molecule, n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), p=1 (N). So 2*8=16, +2=18. Minus 9 (H) is 9, and then minus O and N, which are 1 each, so 18-9-1-1 =7. 7 divided by 2 is 3.5? That's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, one oxygen. Another approach: subtract the number of hydrogens for a fully saturated alkane. A fully saturated C8H18. Our compound has C8H9, which is 9 hydrogens. The difference is 18-9=9. Each double bond or ring is worth 2 hydrogens lost. Each nitro group or similar might contribute, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the degree of unsaturation formula: DoU = (2*(8) +2 -9 -1 -1)/2. Let me compute that properly.

2*8 is 16, plus 2 is 18. Subtract H (9) gives 9. Subtract O (1) and N (1) gives 7. 7 divided by 2 is 3.5 degrees. Hmm, that can't be right. I must have messed up the formula. Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecular formula again. Oh wait, maybe the formula is C8H
