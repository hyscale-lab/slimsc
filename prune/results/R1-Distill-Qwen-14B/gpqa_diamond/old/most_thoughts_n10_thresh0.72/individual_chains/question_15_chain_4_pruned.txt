Okay, so I have this problem here about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers can prioritize their observation time. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: Two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Since the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they have same radii, I guess that means both stars have similar sizes.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the orbit. Wait, more specifically, the geometric probability. Oh right, the formula I think is P = (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the orbital distance. But wait, no, actually, I think it's more about the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. Since both planets have circular orbits, the probability is a function of the size of the orbit compared to the star and the planet's size.

The formula I recall is: P = (R_star / a) * (R_p / R_star), but wait, maybe it's (R_p / a) / (R_star / a) squared? No, maybe it's (R_p / a) divided by (R_star / a), which simplifies to R_p / R_star. But that seems too simple. Hmm, perhaps it's the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size multiplied by the same ratio squared? Or wait, I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) divided by (R_star / a), which would be R_p / R_star. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the formula.

Wait, I shouldn't actually look it up, but I remember that the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R* / a) * (R_p / R* ), but actually, no. Wait, I think the probability is more accurately given by (R_p / a) divided by (R_star / a), but that can't be right because the units don't work. Oh wait, the actual formula is P = (R_p / a) / (R_star / a) )^2 ? No, perhaps not. Maybe it's (R_p / a) / (R_star / a) ) multiplied by something else. Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p / a) * (R_p / R_star), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_s / R_s)), where a_s is the orbital distance in terms of the star's radius. Maybe
