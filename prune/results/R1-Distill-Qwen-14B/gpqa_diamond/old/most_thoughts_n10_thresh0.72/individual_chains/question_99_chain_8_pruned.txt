Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

The question gives me four possible structures, and I need to figure out which one matches the spectral data provided. Let's look at the spectral info first.

The FTIR has a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Oh right, a broad peak in that region usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak because they're strong acids and can form hydrogen bonds. The other peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong absorption which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group because that would explain both the broad peak and the carbonyl.

Now onto the NMR. The 1H NMR shows several peaks but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means double bond hydrogens, so the compound doesn't have any double bonds, at least not with adjacent hydrogens. That rules out any alkenes or aromatic rings, I think. So all the hydrogens are in a single bond environment.

Looking at the splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about what kind of splitting that would cause.

In NMR splitting, each neighboring set of protons splits the signal into a multiplet. So if a proton is next to two different sets, each with multiple neighbors, the splitting becomes a doublet of triplets, etc. 

For example, consider a CH2 group attached to a CH. The CH2 protons might split the CH into a triplet, and the CH might split the CH2 into a quartet or something else. Wait, maybe it's a vicinal coupling scenario. Let me think about each structure.

The structures given are all substituted carboxylic acids. Let's look at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like CH2CH2 with substituents. Wait, more accurately, the main chain seems to be CH2CH2... but I'm a bit confused. Let me draw it out.

Actually, let's consider each option's structure:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Wait, that's (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-COOH? No, wait, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the molecule would have two substituents on adjacent carbons. Each of these CH groups has a methyl (CH3) and an ethyl (C2H5) group attached. So each is a CH with two substit
