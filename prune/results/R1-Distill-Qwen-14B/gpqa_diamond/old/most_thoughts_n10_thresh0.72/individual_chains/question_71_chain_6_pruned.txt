Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there are five exoplanets in a system, and they were discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, which I think means their orbital periods have a particular ratio. The periods are given as a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The planets are numbered 1 through 5. The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature—right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering only the energy it receives from its star. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and some factors like albedo. Oh, wait, the problem states they have the same albedo, so I don't have to worry about that varying.

The formula I recall is T = T_earth * (L / (16πσ d²))^1/4 or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (T) is given by the equation:

T = T_star * (R_star / (2a)) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4 )

But since the orbits are circular (as per the question), the eccentricity e is zero, so that term goes away. Also, albedo A is the same for all planets, so (1 - A) is a constant. So the main factors will be the distance from the star, a.

Wait, but the star's temperature isn't given, but I think the problem is assuming the same star for all planets, so we can consider the ratio without knowing the star's specifics. So the equilibrium temperature should be inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because T ∝ (L/(16πσ a²))^1/4. Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, the correct formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4 )

Since L, A, and σ are constants for all planets, the temperature is inversely proportional to (a)^(1/2), because a is squared and under
