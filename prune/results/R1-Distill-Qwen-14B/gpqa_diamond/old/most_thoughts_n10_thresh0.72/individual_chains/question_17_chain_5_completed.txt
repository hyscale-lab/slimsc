Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution conditions are such that the EDTA is in its correct form to complex with calcium. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything here. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10.

The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which is a 1:1 ratio since Ca is divalent and EDTA is hexadentate, so each EDTA binds one Ca²+.

The formula for the formation constant, Kf, is generally written as:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Wait, but wait, the problem says KCa-EDTA is 5e10. I'm a bit confused about whether that's the formation constant or the stability constant. I think they're the same thing, so Kf is 5e10.

Now, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex [Ca-EDTA²-] is 0.02 M.

But I need to find [Ca²+]. That comes from the dissociation of the complex. So the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in various protonated forms. Since the pH is ideal, I guess that the problem assumes that all the EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca²+. So I don't have to worry about the different protonation states of EDTA. That simplifies things because I can just treat it as [EDTA^4-].

So the equation becomes:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

We are told that [Ca-EDTA²-] is 0.02 M. So we can write:

5e10 = 0.02 / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, the problem is that I don't know [EDTA^4-]. But wait a minute, when the complex dissociates, each mole of Ca-EDTA²- gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then in solution, [Ca²+] would be x, and [EDTA^4-] would also be x, assuming that the dissociation is x. Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the complex is [Ca-EDTA²-], and when it dissociates, it gives Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in a 1:1 ratio. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is a very small number, but the K is very large, so the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the dissociation x is very small compared to 0.02.

So, let's let the dissociation be x. So,

[Ca-EDTA²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 M (since x is very small)

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

So plugging into the equation:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

So,

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13)= sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) )

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) )

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.3e-7. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this value.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M.

Let me double-check the steps. The K is given, and we assumed that the dissociation x is negligible compared to 0.02. Since K is 5e10, which is a large number, the complex is very stable, so x is indeed very small. So the approximation seems valid.

Another thought: what if the initial assumption isn't correct? Let's see. If x is about 6.3e-7, then 0.02 - 6.3e-7 is approximately 0.02, which is correct because 6.3e-7 is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 0.02 = 2e-2, much larger).

So, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant (Kf) provided as 5×10¹⁰. The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the dissociation concentration of the complex be \(x\). Since the dissociation is small due to the large \(K_f\), we approximate \([\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.

Answer: C
