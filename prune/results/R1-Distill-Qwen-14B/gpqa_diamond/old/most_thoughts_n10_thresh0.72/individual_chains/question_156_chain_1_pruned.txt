Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says a chemist does two reactions with different alkenes and then combines the products. Then, they run the mixture on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

First, let's understand the reactions. Both reactions use mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, so it's used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes forms an epoxide. So each starting alkene will turn into an epoxide.

The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Wait, both are the same alkene but with different configurations. (E) is trans, and (Z) is cis. When each reacts with mCPBA, what happens?

Epoxidation with mCPBA typically proceeds via a concerted mechanism, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene should influence the product. For each isomer, the reaction would form an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me think. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an oxygen across the double bond. The product is an epoxide, and the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxide formation would lead to different products.

Let me think about oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2 groups on either side of the double bond. For the (E) isomer, the two substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3 on each end, perhaps?) are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds have a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the possible epoxide products. For each starting alkene, (E) and (Z), the epoxidation would form distinct epoxides. Because the starting alkenes are diastereomers, their epoxides would be different.

Wait, no, wait again. The starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), so they are geometric isomers. When mCPBA adds, the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry. So each would form a different epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe each would form a pair of epoxide diastereomers? Or perhaps each starting isomer gives a single epoxide structure.

Wait, no, for mCPBA adding across the double bond, the epoxide will have the two oxygen atoms on adjacent carbons, with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are trans. So when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen atoms would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are cis, so the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on the same side, making a cis epoxide.

Wait, but in that case, each starting alkene would produce a single epoxide. So Reaction 1 gives a trans epoxide, Reaction 2 gives a cis epoxide. So when the chemist combines both products, they have two different epoxides.

Wait, but wait. Do they? Or are these epoxides actually the same compound? No, because the configuration is different. So, the two products are enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, isn't it? Because the molecule is symmetric around the double bond. So when you epoxidize (E)-oct-4-ene, you get an epoxide with the two oxygens across from each other. But wait, for a symmetric molecule like oct-4-ene, would the (E) and (Z) configurations lead to the same epoxide?

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each side of the double bond? No, more accurately, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's think: Octene is C8H16. The double bond is between C4 and C5.

So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No. Let me write it out.

Actually, (E)-oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-
