Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian given, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that the gamma matrices γ have a mass dimension. What's that again? Oh right, in four-dimensional spacetime, each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Or wait, no. Wait, in 4D, the fields have certain dimensions. Fermions like ψ have a mass dimension of 3/2 because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is d^4x, which is [mass]^−4. So the Lagrangian must have dimension [mass]^4, since the integral of L (times d^4x) gives a dimensionless action. So each term in L must have dimension [mass]^4.

Wait, no, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over d^4x, which has dimension [mass]^−4, the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So let's look at the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break it down.

Each ψ̄ and ψ are spinor fields. In four dimensions, spinor fields have mass dimension 3/2 each. So ψ̄ has dim 3/2, and ψ also has 3/2. So together, ψ̄ ψ would have 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of two gammas, but since the gamma matrices are dimensionless, σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2 * 2) = 3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ψ̄ σ ψ is like a scalar product, so dimension is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F^{μν}
