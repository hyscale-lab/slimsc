Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about mutations in a barley gene. Let me read through the problem again carefully to understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the sequence changes, particularly in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, and each mutant has a change somewhere in the beginning part of the sequence, which is the first exon. The anti-nutritional compound is probably a product of this gene, so if the gene is non-functional, the compound shouldn't be made. So, they want a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

I remember that genes are made of exons and introns, and exons are the coding regions. So, mutations in the exons can affect the protein product. But the question is about the type of mutation that would eliminate the compound. So, we're looking for a mutation that causes a loss of function, maybe a premature stop codon or a missense that disrupts the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Let's compare each mutant.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the changes: The third position in the third codon. The intact is TTCT, so looking at the first few codons.

Wait, perhaps I should write out the codon sequences for each.

The original first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG... So let's break it down into triplets.

ATG (start), TTT, CTC, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG... etc.

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTC becomes ATG TTT CTA? Wait, let me line them up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare the sequences:

Intact:  ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A (wait, no, how's the sequence aligned?)

Wait, looking at the sequences, the mutant 1 has:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So let's break it down:

Original first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A (wait, the third codon is CTA? Let me see:

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TT... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.
