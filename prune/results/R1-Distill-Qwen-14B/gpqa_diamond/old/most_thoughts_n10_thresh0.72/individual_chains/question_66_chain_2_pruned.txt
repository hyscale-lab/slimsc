Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the SM. But wait, does SMEFT include all possible operators or only some?

I think the SM respects certain symmetries. For example, the SM has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. But wait, what about Poincare symmetry? Oh, right, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations (like in special relativity). So if the SM has Poincare symmetry, then SMEFT should as well. But wait, SMEFT includes higher-dimension termsâ€”do they affect this symmetry?

Wait, the operators in SMEFT are constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the SM. So any operators added should maintain these symmetries. So Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be preserved. Because without them, the theory wouldn't make sense in a relativistic framework.

What about CP and CPT symmetries? I remember that the SM doesn't have a global symmetry for
