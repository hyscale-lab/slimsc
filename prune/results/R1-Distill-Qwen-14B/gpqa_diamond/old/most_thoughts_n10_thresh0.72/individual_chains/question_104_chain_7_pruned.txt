Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The star moves back and forth, and we detect the shift in its spectral lines, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, and the planets are similar in mass. But the RV measurements are different: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is linked to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think. The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the star's mass. But I need to remember the exact formula.

I recall the formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )^(1/2) ) ) * ( (1/( (1-e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M1 = M2 = M_sun. Also, the planets have similar masses, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, but in the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. Also, because the planet masses are similar and the stars are same mass, M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So the ratio of K1 to K2 would depend on the orbital periods.

Wait, but in this problem, K is given as the observed shift. Planet #1 has K1=5 milliangstrom, and planet #2 has K2=7 milliangstrom.

So, the ratio K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4. But how does K relate to the orbital period?

Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) )) ) * ( (P/(2π) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, perhaps
