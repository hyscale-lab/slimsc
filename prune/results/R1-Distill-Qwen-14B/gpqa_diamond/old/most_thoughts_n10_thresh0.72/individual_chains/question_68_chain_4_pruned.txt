Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. So, I guess that means it's in the eigenstate of S_z, right? Because when the magnetic field is along z, the system's Hamiltonian is proportional to S_z, and the states are eigenstates of S_z.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Wait, but if the first field is off, does that mean the Hamiltonian changes from being in z-direction to y-direction? Oh, right, because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is mu · B. Initially, mu is gamma S_z, and B was along z, so the Hamiltonian was proportional to S_z. When B is along y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y.

Now, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. So, we need to find the oscillation frequency of <S_z> over time.

I remember that when a two-level system is subject to a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the expectation values can oscillate. But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian isn't time-dependent in the usual way; it's a sudden change from H_z to H_y. So maybe it's a problem involving Rabi oscillations?

Wait, no, Rabi oscillations are when you have a two-level system under an oscillating field, but in this case, the field is turned on suddenly. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a spin precessing under a magnetic field in the y-direction. Spin precession causes the expectation value of the spin components to oscillate.

Let me think about the initial state. Initially, the spin is aligned with the z-direction. So, it's in the state |+z>, which can be written as a spinor [1; 0]. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the y-direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma * mu_0 * B S_y, but wait, more accurately, mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian is H = mu · B = gamma B S_y.

Wait, actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so when B is in the y-direction, H = mu · B = gamma B S_y. But wait, I think the actual form might have a negative sign because the energy is -mu·B. Oh wait, the magnetic moment tends to align with the field, so the potential energy is U = -mu · B. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = -gamma B S_y. Or maybe I'm getting the sign wrong here. Maybe the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, but the direction depends on the sign. Hmm, perhaps the exact sign won't affect the frequency, just the phase. So maybe I can proceed without worrying about the sign.

The time evolution of the spin state is determined by the Schrodinger equation. The state at time t is given by the time evolution operator, which for a Hamiltonian H is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). But since ħ is often set to 1 in these units, it's exp(-i H t).

The initial state is |+z>, which is (1, 0) in the computational basis. Let me represent the spin states in the S_z basis because that's the basis we're most familiar with.

The Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which can be written as superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

Wait, so let me recall the eigenstates of S_y. The spin matrices in the S_z basis are:

S_x = (ħ/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
S_y = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
S_z = (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, S_y has eigenvalues plus and minus (ħ/2), and the eigenstates are |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + i |-z>), and |-y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - i |-z>).

Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So, for S_y |+y> = (ħ/2)|+y>, and similarly for |-y>.

The time evolution under H = (gamma B) S_y is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp( -i (gamma B S_y) t / ħ )

Wait, but since S_y has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2), we can write the energy eigenvalues E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = -gamma B (ħ/2). Because H = gamma B S_y = gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y (if sigma_y is the Pauli matrix), the energies are E = ± gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the units here. Let me think in terms of angular frequency. The energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ / 2 ), so the transition frequency between the states would be (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B. But wait, frequency is energy over h-bar. So the energy difference is 2*(gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but that would be the frequency of oscillations between the states, like Rabi frequency. Alternatively, when the state is a superposition of the energy eigenstates, the phase difference between them causes oscillations in expectation values.

So, the initial state is |+z> = [1; 0]. Let me express this state in terms of the eigenstates of H.

The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, as I wrote earlier. Let me write |+z> as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

|+z> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+y> + |-y> )

Wait, because
