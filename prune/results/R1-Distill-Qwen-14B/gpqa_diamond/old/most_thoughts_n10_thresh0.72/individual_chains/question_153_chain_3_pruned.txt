Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question presents three separate reactions, labeled (A), (B), and (C), and asks for the correct products. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for each reaction. Hmm. I need to figure out each reaction's outcome.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The conditions NaOEt in EtOH probably deprotonate something, creating a nucleophile. Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile here is likely from dimethyl malonate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a diester of malonic acid. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. In the presence of a base like NaOEt, it can form an enolate ion. The enolate has a negative charge on the alpha carbon, making it a good nucleophile. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. The acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-C=C-OEt where the central C is attached to p-tolyl. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOEt? Or perhaps the substituents are on the double bond. Let me think again.

(E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, so 3-(p-tol
