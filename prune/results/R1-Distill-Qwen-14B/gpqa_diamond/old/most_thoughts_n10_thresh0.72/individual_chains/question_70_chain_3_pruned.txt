Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the reactions given. I'll list them out.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests maybe an octahedral structure, but I'm not sure yet.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So maybe C is reacting in a way that breaks into smaller molecules?

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids like HCl, weak like HCN or something else. So, breaking into A and two acids. That might hint that C is some kind of salt or compound that when hydrolyzed, gives back A and acids.

4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something else. If B is a gas, perhaps it's O2, NH3, or something else.

Wait, let me think about each reaction.

Starting with reaction 3: C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is strong, G is weak. So perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is something like NH4NO3, which upon hydrolysis gives NH4OH (a weak acid, but wait, isn't NH4OH a weak base?) Hmm, maybe another example. Or perhaps C is a sulfide, but that hydrolyzes to give H2S and another acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, but not sure.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again: A + 8 B → C. 8 equivalents might suggest that each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B. So perhaps A is something that forms an octahedral complex. For example, maybe A is Fe(0) reacting with B as O2 or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. Wait, but B is a gas. So possible candidates for B: O2, Cl2, F2, maybe NH3, but NH3 is a gas too. Or maybe B is H2.

Wait, if B is H2, then 8 H2 per A would suggest A is some metal that forms an octahedral hydride. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a metal reacting with a gas to form a compound. For example, Fe reacting with Cl2 to form FeCl3, but that's only 3 Cl per Fe. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is copper and B is sulfur. But 8 equivalents would be a lot. Wait, perhaps it's about coordination compounds. For example, if A is a metal ion forming an octahedral complex with B as ligands.

Wait, reaction 4 says D + B → H, which is a solvent. If B is a gas like H2, and D is maybe O2? No, because H2 and O2 would
