Okay, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's think it through step by step. So the question is about a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, right. The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor, so initially, it has no charge. Then, it has a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the main conductor's center. And the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R, the radius of the conductor. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay, so I need to find E at point P. Let's recall some concepts. I remember that when you have a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. So, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material is a conductor, and the charges will redistribute to cancel the field inside the conductor.

Wait, right, because for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. So the induced charges on the inner surface must produce an electric field that cancels the field due to the charge +q inside the cavity. So the inner surface has -q, and then the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor as a whole has no net charge. Wait no, the conductor is initially uncharged. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q induced, so the outer surface must have +q to balance it out, since the total conductor's charge is zero. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the sum of all charges on the conductor (inner and outer surfaces) must be zero. Oh wait, the inner surface has induced -q, so the outer surface must have +q? Because the conductor's net charge is zero, so outer surface charge is +q.

Wait no, that's not right. The conductor is
