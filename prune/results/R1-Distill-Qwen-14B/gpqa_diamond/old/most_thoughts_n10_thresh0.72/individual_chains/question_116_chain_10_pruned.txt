Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in class.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm. I remember that in NMR, the number of protons in each signal can give information about the structure. 

The triplet with 6H at 0.9 ppm usually suggests something like a methyl group attached to a CH2 because in such cases, the methyl protons are split into a triplet. Wait, wait—if it's a triplet, that implies two neighboring groups. So, maybe it's a (CH2CH3) group. Like, maybe a -CH2CH2CH3 structure? Or perhaps more likely, two equivalent methyl groups attached to a CH2. Oh wait, another possibility. If it's 6H, maybe it's two sets of three H each, like two methyl groups attached to a central CH2. So maybe something like (CH2CH3)2CH or similar?

Let me think about the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet would mean three neighboring protons. So, it's a CH2 group next to another CH2. For example, maybe a CH2CH2 group where each has two Hs. Wait, but 4H—so perhaps two CH2 groups each with 2 Hs, but that would give a quartet if they are adjacent. Like a -CH2CH2- structure. So putting it all together, perhaps Compound A is diethyl something? Or maybe it's 2,2-dimethylbutane or something like that. Wait, no, let's think. 

Wait, another approach. The first NMR signal: triplet (6H) at 0.9 ppm. That's a classic for a methyl group attached to a CH2. Because a CH2CH3 group would have a triplet. So, for example, in an ethyl group, the CH2CH3 has a triplet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, no, the CH3
