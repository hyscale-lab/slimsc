Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs according to Einstein's theory of relativity. But wait, I need to think this through carefully.

The question says that an alien astronaut is 22 years old and is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years, which is like 150 Earth years. The destination is Earth, and we're asked how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, so the key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Because in special relativity, moving clocks run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. But wait, in this case, the astronaut is the one moving, so their own time is the proper time, which is shorter than the time measured by someone at rest relative to the starting point.

The formula I remember is the time dilation formula: tau equals t multiplied by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), where tau is the proper time (what the astronaut experiences), t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and v is the velocity.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, I've also heard about the formula using Lorentz gamma factor. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So tau equals t divided by gamma, or t equals gamma multiplied by tau. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The
