Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions with different alkenes, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. I need to determine what the chromatograms will show in terms of the number of peaks.

Hmm. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So, reaction 1 and reaction 2 are epoxidation reactions, right?

Wait, but when you epoxidize an alkene, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product. Let me think about that. For epoxidation, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide. The addition is stereospecific, so the configuration of the double bond will influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to an epoxide. The reaction is an electrocyclic process, so the endo transition state leads to the more substituted epoxide, but wait, when adding to a symmetric double bond like oct-4-ene, which is symmetric, the endo transition state would form the same product regardless of E or Z configuration?

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. So if it's (E) or (Z), but for oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon are the same. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene structure is CH2CH2 on each end. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? I'm getting
