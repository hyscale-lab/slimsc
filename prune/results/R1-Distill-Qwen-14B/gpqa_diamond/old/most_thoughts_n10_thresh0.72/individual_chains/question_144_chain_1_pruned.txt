Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the formula for the decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), right? But wait, I also recall that for particles, the lifetime is connected to the width via the uncertainty principle. So, the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by the width Γ. Oh, right, the formula is τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is the decay width, so I think Γ is the total decay width, which is given here as 320 MeV. So first, I need to calculate the lifetime τ, then multiply by the speed of light c to get the distance. Oh, and since the decay length is L = cτ.

So let's break it down. First, calculate τ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because when working in GeV units, it's easier to use this value. So, τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is in MeV, and ħ is in GeV·s. Oh, right, I need to convert Γ to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6
