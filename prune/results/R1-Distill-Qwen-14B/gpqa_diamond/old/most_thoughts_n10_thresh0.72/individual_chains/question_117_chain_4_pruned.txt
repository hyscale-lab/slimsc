Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right. That's when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the molecule isn't symmetrical and can exist as mirror images, which are non-superimposable. These are also called enantiomers.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each with different combinations.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So this is a biphenyl structure, where two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6 on each benzene, and at positions 2, there are carboxylate ester groups (since it's dimethyl, so OMe groups). Wait, but biphenyls can have some special cases. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, I'm thinking about whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then maybe there's no chiral center. Let me visualize: the biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. If both have nitro groups and ester groups in such a way that the arrangement is symmetrical, then maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. Wait, if the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring, then perhaps the arrangement is symmetrical. So, maybe this molecule doesn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, perhaps the substituents create a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene, but benzene itself doesn't have chiral centers. Unless the substituents cause the entire molecule to have a center of chirality. But in this case, the substitution is symmetrical on both rings, so maybe it's not chiral. So I don't think this one shows optical isomerism.

Wait, or is there another possibility? The substituents are at 6,6' positions and 2,2' positions. So if each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carbamate ester at 2, then considering the biphenyl structure, perhaps they can rotate. Wait, but biphenyls can have axial chirality if they have substituents in such a way that the two rings are connected in a way that their substituents can't be superimposed by rotation. So, like if the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions on each ring, maybe the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is in a position that makes the entire structure asymmetrical. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here, but let me move on and come back to it.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is like CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Wait, actually, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be CH3CHOHCOOH. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is OMe-O-CO-O-CH2-CHOH-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it properly. So the ester is OMe attached to the carbonyl, and the rest is the 2-hydroxypropanoate part. So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3. So the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Now, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center. The carbon with the hydroxyl group is the second carbon. Let's count the substituents: the central carbon (second) is attached to:

- a hydroxyl group (OH),
- two CH2 groups (one from the carboxylate and one from the methyl ester? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester. Propanoic acid is CH2
