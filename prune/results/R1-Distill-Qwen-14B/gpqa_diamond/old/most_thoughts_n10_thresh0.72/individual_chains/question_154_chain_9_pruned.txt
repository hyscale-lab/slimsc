Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece this together.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158, which is 32%. Hmm, that extra peak might be a fragment or perhaps an isotope. Wait, but wait, the molecular ion is at 156. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas.

The molecular weight is 156 g/mol. Let's consider the possible functional groups. The IR data shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, another strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl group. 1720 is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but sometimes it can be a bit higher. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, that's around 2800, but wait, that's the stretch for aldehyde C-H. Wait, no, the carbonyl of aldehyde is higher, like 1720? Hmm, maybe.

Then looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), that's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, or maybe a carboxylic acid -OH (but that's usually around 12 ppm, but sometimes broader). Wait, wait, the broad peak in IR suggests O-H, which would point more towards a carboxylic acid. But the NMR at 11.0 is a singlet, which might suggest a phenolic OH or an aldehyde. Wait, phenol OH protons are usually around 5 ppm, but if it's de-shielded, maybe higher. But 11 is more indicative of an aldehyde. Unless it's an acidic proton like -COOH. Wait, the -COOH proton is
