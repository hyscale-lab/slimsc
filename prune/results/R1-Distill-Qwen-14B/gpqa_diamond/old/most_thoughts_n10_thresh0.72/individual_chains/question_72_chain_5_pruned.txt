Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is a norbornene structure, right? So the substituent is a tert-butoxy group at the 7 position. That part I think I get.

Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Wait, sodium iodide with dibromides... Oh, right, that's probably an elimination reaction. Or wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Since there are two equivalents, maybe a di-substitution. Alternatively, considering that the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups, perhaps a di-elimination? Or maybe a substitution where the bromide leaves, and the molecule adds something else.

Wait, the starting material has a bicyclo structure with an ether group. The other compound is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. So when they react, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder type reaction? Because the norbornene is a diene, and the cyclohexadiene could be a dienophile. But wait, the cyclohexadiene has substituents with Br groups. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, the reaction conditions are with sodium iodide. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But the molecule with Br is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those positions (5 and 6) have -CH2Br groups. But when you have two equivalents, perhaps it's a substitution where the Br is replaced. But the other molecule is 7-(tert-butoxy) norbornene.

Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling reaction. Oh, wait, when you have di-iodide and dibromides, perhaps it's undergoing an elimination when treated with a base. But sodium iodide isn't a base. Wait, NaI is a good source of iodide ions, which can act as a nucleophile. So maybe the Br in the di-bromomethyl groups are being replaced by iodide? But why?

Wait, perhaps this is a substitution where the Br is replaced, but considering the reaction, maybe it's a coupling. Oh! Wait, when you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo), they can undergo elimination to form alkenes when treated with a base. But here, the molecule has two Brs on adjacent carbons (since it's 5 and 6 positions on cyclohexa-1,3-diene, so they're adjacent?), wait no, positions 5 and 6 are on a cyclohexane ring, so they are adjacent in the ring, but their substituents are on carbons that are adjacent.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2Br group. So each substituent is -CH2Br. So the cyclohexadiene is 1,3-diene, meaning double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4 (maybe?) or between 1-2 and 4-5? Wait, I'm a bit rusty on numbering, but cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, making it a conjugated diene. So that's the structure.

So when you have two equivalents of this
