Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct products for each of the three given reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate. So, the general process is that the enolate attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I think sodium ethoxide is a base, so it would deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so the enolate would be at the alpha position. Then, this enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So its structure is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The acrylate part is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3-position. So maybe the structure is CH₂=CH-C-(p-tolyl) with the ester group. Or perhaps it's CH₂=C-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is on the third carbon, so it's CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. Acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-O-R, so 3-position would be the CH₂=CH- part. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively,
