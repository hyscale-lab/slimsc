Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out which options are correct. Let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, I'll tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the migration of a hydrogen atom along with the shift of a double bond, typically between carbonyl groups. This is common in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, like 1,2-diketones.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which usually has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Wait, benzoquinone can be 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, but wait no, quinones are the oxidized form with two ketone groups. So benzoquinone would have two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, right? Like in para-quinone, it's 1,4-diketone, which wouldn't be adjacent. Oh wait, actually, benzoquinone can exist in different forms. Benzo-1,4-dione would be para-benzoquinone, whereas 1,2-benzoquinone would have adjacent ketones. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure, maybe I should think about tautomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when there are adjacent carbonyl groups, allowing for the shift of a hydrogen. For example, in o-phenylenedione (1,2-benzendione), tautomerism is possible because the two carbonyls are next to each other. So if benzoquinone is 1,2-dione, it can undergo tautomerism. But if it's 1,4-dione, like para-benzoquinone, then the two ketones are opposite each other, so no adjacent carbonylsâ€”so no tautomerism.

So the compounds in part A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let's analyze both.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Let me imagine the structure. It's a cyclohexane ring with ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So each ketone is separated by a single carbon. Wait, that's positions 1, 3, 5, right? So in a six-membered ring, that's every other carbon. So between each ketone is a CH2 group, but wait, no, because if it's 1,3,5, then between 1 and 3 is two carbons apart? Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So 1,3,5 would be every other carbon. So maybe the ring has three ketones opposite each other. Wait, no, perhaps each is adjacent in a certain way.

Wait, the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a ring with three carbonyl groups, each separated by one carbon.
