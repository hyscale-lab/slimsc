Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to figure out which one is correct. 

First, I'll try to understand the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl group substituted with two groups: a bromo at position 3 and a nitro at position 5. Additionally, it's attached to an ethan-1-one group, which is a ketone. So the molecule is a ketone attached to a benzene ring that has bromine and nitro substituents. 

Since the ketone is at position 1 (the ethanone is attached to the benzene as a substituent), I think the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone group, the bromine, and the nitro group. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached to the benzene. So the benzene has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions, and the ketone is at the 1 position, which is adjacent on the benzene. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would be 1, 3, and 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3? Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- something. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-R, where R is attached to the carbonyl. So in this case, the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is acetone. So 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would have the structure where the benzene ring has a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group) attached at position 1, a bromine at 3, and a nitro at 5.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: at positions 1 (COCH3?), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, but wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene, so the substituent is a ketone group (COCH3) attached at position 1. So the benzene is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Now, to synthesize this, I need to go from benzene to this substituted benzene. The substituents are Br, NO2, and COCH3. The challenge is to arrange them in the correct positions with the highest yield.

I remember that the order of introducing substituents matters because of the directing effects of the substituents. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups present on the aromatic ring.

Let's think about possible steps:

1. Introduce a nitro group (since nitro is a strong meta-directing group).
