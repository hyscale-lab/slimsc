Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. It's about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents on unknown compounds, and I need to pick the correct starting materials.

The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they're used under different conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used in hydroboration reactions, but wait, wait—no, wait. Oh, wait, LiBH4 is a hydride source. So in some reactions, like the reduction of ketones or aldehydes. But wait, BH3 is also a hydride source but maybe in a different context. Or, wait, BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, where it adds to alkenes. Oh wait, but in this case, the products are ketones. So maybe these are reductions of some sort.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me draw that structure. Pyran is a six-membered ring, oxygen in position 2. So 2H-pyran-2-one would have a ketone at position 2, and the ring is partially hydrogenated (so maybe one double bond is not present). The 4-position has an ethyl group. So the structure would be a tetrahydrofuran-like ring but bigger—pyran. So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have the ring with five single bonds and one double bond, but I think tetrahydro usually refers to having four hydrogenations, so maybe the ring is fully saturated?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, pyran has five carbon atoms in the ring with one oxygen. So 2H-pyran-2-one. Oh, okay, so it's a cyclic hemiketal or something. So the product is a cyclic ketone, a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, the product is (R) or (S) configuration. So the starting material must have a chiral center that's being determined by the reaction.

Now, the reactions are being done with different reducing agents. So, I think that the starting materials for each reaction are carbonyl-containing compounds, maybe esters or ketones, which upon reduction would form alcohols. But wait, in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like an epoxide? No, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone with an ether group or something else.

Hold on, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. But then the product is a cyclic ketone, which doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ether group, and the reduction is adding hydrogen somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps these reactions involve the reduction of an epoxide. Wait, no, because LiBH4 is not typically used for opening epoxides. Maybe it's a reduction of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: The product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a diethyl ketone with an adjacent protecting group or something that forms the ring upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent ether oxygen, which upon treatment with a reducing agent forms the cyclic hemiacetal or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides and the reduction is doing something else.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are gamma-lactones or some kind of cyclic esters. Or perhaps the starting materials are esters that, upon reduction, form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another angle: If I think about the product being a cyclic ketone, then perhaps the starting material is an ester or a ketone that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic structure. Because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it's used for more challenging reductions, like esters to alcohols.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the reaction. If the product is a cyclic ketone, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (like a lactone). When you reduce a lactone with LiBH4, you might open the ester and form an alcohol. Wait, but LiBH4 is a hydride source; it typically reduces esters to alcohols. So, for example, if you have an ester group, R-O-CO-O-R', when treated with LiBH4, would it reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol?

Wait, more accurately, esters (R-COOR') are reduced by LiBH4 to produce R-CH2-O-R' ? Or wait, no. LiBH4 typically reduces esters to glycols. Wait, no, I think that's for epoxides. No, wait, for esters: The ester group (R-O-CO-R') would be reduced by LiBH4 to R-O-CH2-OH plus R'CH2OH? Or perhaps it's more likely that the ester is converted into an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific reactions. In the first reaction, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Similarly, B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S) version.

Wait a second, LiBH4 and BH3 are both borohydride sources, but their reaction conditions differ. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce esters, while BH3 is usually used for ketones and aldehydes, maybe not esters. Wait, no, BH3 is typically a milder reducing agent, but in certain cases, like when it's a bulky borane, it can have different selectivities, like in hydroboration.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones with some substituents, and the reducing agents are being used in some kind of ring-opening or ring-forming reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters that, upon reduction, form the cyclic ketone via some kind of cyclization.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, undergoes keto-enol tautomerism or some kind of ring formation.

Wait, let's think about the product again. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring with oxygen at position 2, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Let me imagine the structure. The ring would have five carbons and one oxygen. So positions 1 to 6 going around: position 2 is the oxygen, position 2 has a carbonyl group (so it's a ketone). Position 4 has an ethyl group.

So, the ring is like O at position 2, with two adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3), then a CH2 (position 4 with ethyl), then another CH2 (position 5), and position 6 is a CH2 connected back to position 1.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group, which upon reduction forms the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Let's say we have an ester group and a ketone group on the same carbon. For example, a compound like R-O-CO-R', where R' is a chain that can form a ring upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with an adjacent carbonyl group. When reduced, the ester opens, and the carbonyl is converted into an alcohol, forming a ring.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like CH2(COOR)CH2CH2OR'. When reduced, the ester (R-O-CO-) is reduced to an alcohol, R-OH, and the ketone (CO) is also reduced to an alcohol. But that would give diols, but perhaps in this case, the molecule can cyclize to form the pyran ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is something like a pentanoic acid ester with an ethyl group and an isobutoxy group, as in the options.

Wait, looking at the options for the starting materials:

Option A: A and B are both (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Option B: Both are (R) configuration.

Option C: A is S, B is R.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

Hmm, so each starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with either R or S configuration.

Wait, so the structure is pentanoic acid, with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 has an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group. Position 3 has an ethyl group.

So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C-O-R (where R is isobutoxy) and a ketone at C5.

Wait, more accurately, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But here, it's 3-ethyl, 5-isobutoxy and 5-oxo. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu (but wait, pentanoic acid is five carbons. Let's number from the COOH end as position 1.

So:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl group]
4: CH2
5: C(O-iBu) = O-isobutoxy and a ketone (oxo). Wait, but 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy would be on the same carbon? Because position 5 is the last carbon before COOH, but wait, wait, wait. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, with the COOH at position 1. So position 2 is next to COOH, etc.

Wait, for 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid:

So, position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl group]
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: C(O-iBu) (but wait, that's the fifth carbon? Because pentanoic acid has five carbons in the chain. So position 5 would be the methyl group attached to the COOH.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw this structure.

Pentanoic acid is: CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH.

But the substituents are at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). So position 5 is the last carbon (since it's pentanoic). So for position 5, the functional groups would be a ketone (oxo) and an isobutoxy group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, but that's impossible because a single carbon can't have both an isobutoxy and a ketone group. Unless it's something like a geminal di-substitution, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

The pentanoic acid is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-iBu)

Wait, but that would be position 5 as the last CH2 before COOH. Or perhaps the structure is:

The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-(isobutoxy)pentan-5-one. So, a five-carbon chain with a ketone at position 5 and an isobutoxy group at position 5. Wait, that's not possible because position 5 can't have both groups on the same carbon unless it's a geminal substitution, which is possible but a bit unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on different positions. Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(O-iBu)-CO ?

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the starting material as a gamma-keto ester. For example, the starting material could be an ester (like R-O-CO-) attached to a gamma-ketone. So when you reduce it, the ester becomes an alcohol and the ketone becomes another alcohol, but in such a way that the molecule cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, in the product, we have a six-membered ring with a ketone. So the starting material must have a structure that allows the formation of such a ring upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent that can form the ring upon reduction.

Wait, but when LiBH4 is used, it can open esters and lactones. So if the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group, perhaps the reduction would open the ester and form a diol which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a carbonyl group in a position that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic structure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry of the product.

The product from A is (R)-4-ethyl..., and from B is (S)-4-ethyl.... So the configuration of the starting material must influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent chiral center. When reduced, the hydride adds in a certain way, determining the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to the formation of the most stable carbocation in the mechanism. Wait, no, wait, in the reduction of a ketone, it's a hydride transfer. For a ketone, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the borate attacks the adjacent (alpha) carbon. Then, the workup (H+) gives the alcohol.

Wait, but in the case of cyclic hemiacetals, perhaps the reduction forms a new chiral center.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diethyl ketone with an adjacent ester group. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the ketone becomes another alcohol, leading to a cyclic hemiacetal.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diketone, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism of the reduction and how the configuration is determined.

When you reduce a ketone with a hydride source like LiBH4, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, which is the electrophilic carbon. The borohydride attacks from the opposite side, leading to an anti addition. This is important for the stereochemistry.

Wait, but in the case of a cyclic hemiacetal, the addition of the hydride would form a new chiral center, which would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is either R or S. So the starting material's configuration must influence this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the alcohol and allows ring formation.

Wait, if the starting material is an ester, like CH2CH2CO-O-R, where R is a substituent that can form a ring upon reduction.

Wait, let's think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has an ethyl group at position 4. So the ethyl group must come from the starting material. So the starting material has an ethyl group in a position that ends up at position 4 after reduction and ring formation.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example, the structure is:

RCO-O-R', where R is a chain that can form the ring upon reduction.

Wait, if the R group is CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3), then upon reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the ketone becomes an alcohol, which then can form the cyclic ether.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid). So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-iBu)

Wait, that would make it a five-carbon chain with substituents at positions 3 (ethyl) and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). Hmm, but that seems a bit crowded on the same carbon, but perhaps it's possible.

So when LiBH4 is added, it would reduce the ester (if it's an ester) to an alcohol. Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid, not an ester. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an acid chloride or an ester. But the options given are acids, so perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction conditions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols, but it might not reduce ketones as readily as BH3? No, wait, both LiBH4 and BH3 can reduce ketones, but BH3 is usually used in more controlled conditions, like in hydroboration reactions.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a ketone that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because reducing a ketone would give an alcohol, not a ketone. So maybe the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, and the reduction opens the ester and forms the ring.

Wait, another approach: The product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring. So the starting material must have a chain that allows the formation of this ring upon reduction.

Assuming that, perhaps the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, which upon reduction and cyclization forms the six-membered ring.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, it's a pentanoic acid with substituents on C3 (ethyl) and C5 (isobutoxy and oxo).

So its structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-iBu)

So when LiBH4 is added, it would reduce the ester (if present) or the ketone. Wait, but this is a carboxylic acid, not an ester. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, LiBH4 can reduce carboxylic acids? No, not typically. LiBH4 generally doesn't reduce carboxylic acids; they're usually unreactive under such conditions. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but the options given are acids.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto acid. So, a compound with both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. For example, something like CH2C(O)COOH. But in this case, the structure is more complex.

Wait, perhaps when LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester group (if present) to an alcohol, and then the molecule cyclizes to form the ring.

But the starting material is an acid, so maybe it's not an ester. Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a lactone ring. A lactone is a cyclic ester, and LiBH4 could open it.

So, if the starting material is a lactone with a ketone group, then reduction would open the lactone and reduce the ketone, leading to diols and then cyclization.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the stereochemistry again.

The product has either R or S configuration at position 4. So the starting material must have a chiral center that affects which way the hydride adds.

In the reduction of a ketone, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the borate attacks the alpha carbon from the opposite side (due to the mechanism). This leads to an anti addition, which can influence the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, but in this case, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that is retained or inverted during the reduction.

Alternatively, the starting material's configuration determines the direction of the reduction, thereby setting the configuration of the product.

Wait, the starting material is an acid, so perhaps the configuration is at the alpha position relative to the carboxylic acid.

Let me think about the starting material structure again. It's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-iBu)

Wait, that's a five-carbon chain. So the substituents are at C3 (ethyl) and C5 (isobutoxy and oxo). So the C5 is a ketone and has an isobutoxy group.

Wait, but that's a bit tricky because the same carbon (C5) can't have both a ketone (O) and an isobutoxy group (O). Unless it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's not common. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the isobutoxy is on C5 and the oxo is on C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu

Wait, that would make the ketone on C4 and the isobutoxy on C4 as well. Hmm, but that would be a geminal di-substitution again.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(O-iBu)-CH2-O-iBu

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's imagine the formation of this product.

The product is a six-membered ring with an ethyl group at position 4. So the starting material must have a chain that can form this ring upon reduction.

Assuming the starting material is an ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into an alcohol, allowing the formation of the ring.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like:

R-CO-O-R'

When reduced, the ester becomes R-OH and the ketone becomes R'-CH2-OH, but that's perhaps leading to a diol which can cyclize to form the ring.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material's reduction doesn't directly form the ketone but allows the ring to form with the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the ring.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the reaction again.

LiBH4 is used in the first reaction to produce (R) configuration, and BH3 in the second to produce (S) configuration.

Wait, perhaps the two reducing agents are leading to different stereochemical outcomes. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may proceed through a different mechanism than BH3, which is typically used in hydroboration reactions. Wait, but in this case, BH3 is being used as a reducing agent, perhaps for ketones.

Wait, wait, BH3 is often used in the reduction of esters to alcohols, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a simple reduction but a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a conjugated enone, and the reduction is adding across the double bond.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material has a conjugated system that upon reduction forms the ring.

Hmm, this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think about which starting material would lead to the correct configuration upon reduction.

The product from A is (R), and from B is (S). So the configuration of the starting material must be opposite for the two reactions.

Looking at the options, options C and D have A and B with opposite configurations.

So if I can figure out which reaction leads to which configuration, I can choose between these.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the borate attacks the alpha carbon. The stereochemistry of the attack depends on the structure of the starting material.

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon (the electrophilic carbon), and the borohydride attacks the alpha carbon from the opposite side, leading to the anti addition. But if the alpha carbon is already chiral, the configuration would influence the outcome.

Alternatively, if the starting material has a chiral center near the carbonyl, the reduction could lead to a certain configuration.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material as (R) configuration. When reduced, would it lead to (R) or (S) in the product?

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is retained or inverted during the reduction.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone, the configuration of any chiral centers adjacent to the carbonyl may influence the product's configuration.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the specific options.

Option D: A is (R), B is (S).

So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R) product, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives (S) product.

Which of these options would lead to the correct configuration?

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the borate attacks the alpha carbon from the opposite side. So, if the starting material's alpha carbon is R, the attack would be from the opposite face, leading to the configuration in the product.

Alternatively, if the starting material's alpha carbon is S, the attack would be from the opposite face, leading to a certain configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the attack direction. Let me think: in the reduction of a ketone, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the borate attacks the alpha carbon. The borate comes from the less hindered side, which is the opposite side of the carbonyl oxygen.

So, if the alpha carbon is chiral, the configuration of the starting material would influence which face the borate attacks, thereby determining the product's configuration.

For example, if the starting material's alpha carbon is R configuration, the borate would attack from the opposite face, leading to the product having a certain configuration.

But I'm not exactly sure how this affects the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is the same as the product because the reduction doesn't change the configuration. But that may not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of an ester to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. In that case, the configuration of the starting material would influence the diol's configuration, which then determines the cyclic product's configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material's configuration is the same as the product's. Because if the starting material is R, the product would be R. But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the options, options C and D have A and B with opposite configurations.

If the reaction using LiBH4 leads to the (R) product and the reaction using BH3 leads to (S), then the starting materials must have opposite configurations.

So, if A is R, B is S (option D), or A is S, B is R (option C).

Which of these is correct?

Wait, the question states that the chemist used two different reducing agents. So perhaps one agent leads to retention of configuration, and the other leads to inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 leads to a certain configuration, while BH3 leads to the opposite.

Wait, but I don't know the exact behavior of these reducing agents in this context. Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's approach.

Wait, another thought: The product is a cyclic ketone, which may have been formed via a hemiacetal or some kind of cyclization during the reduction.

So, the starting material must have a structure that, upon reduction, can form the ring with the correct configuration.

If the starting material is (R) configuration, and the reaction leads to (R) product, then that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is determined by the approach of the hydride.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the options again.

Options:

A) Both A and B are (S)
B) Both are (R)
C) A is S, B is R
D) A is R, B is S

The product from A (using LiBH4) is R, and from B (using BH3) is S.

If the reaction conditions (LiBH4 vs BH3) affect the stereochemistry, then the configuration of the starting material must be such that when reduced with LiBH4, it gives R, and when reduced with BH3, it gives S.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is opposite to the product, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents' selectivity. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may proceed through a different mechanism than BH3.

LiBH4 is typically used in more polar aprotic solvents, while BH3 might be used in less polar or different conditions.

Wait, but in the case of ketone reduction, both reagents would add hydride to the carbonyl carbon.

But perhaps the approach of the hydride differs based on the reducing agent, leading to different configurations.

Wait, no, I think that in the reduction of ketones, the hydride adds from the less hindered side, which is determined by the structure of the molecule.

So, the configuration of the starting material would influence which face is less hindered, thus determining the product's configuration.

So, if the starting material is R, the less hindered face would be a certain side, leading to the hydride adding in a certain way, giving R or S in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration is opposite to the product's.

Wait, perhaps the product's configuration is the same as the starting material's.

Wait, let's think of the starting material as (R) configuration. After reduction, the product would be (R) as well. But that's just a guess.

But in the problem, when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R), and when B is treated with BH3, it gives (S). So A and B must have opposite configurations.

Looking at the options, options C and D fit this scenario.

So, if option D is correct, A is R and B is S, then using LiBH4 on R gives R, and BH3 on S gives S.

Alternatively, if option C is correct, A is S and B is R, then LiBH4 on S gives R, and BH3 on R gives S.

But why would the same starting material with opposite configurations give opposite products?

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents cause the opposite configurations.

Wait, perhaps the reaction's mechanism leads to the opposite configuration.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is R, the hydride adds from one face, leading to the product being S.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration is opposite to the starting material's.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration is the same as the starting material's.

Given that, if A is R and B is S, then the products would be R and S, which matches the question.

So that would point to option D.

Alternatively, if A is S and B is R, then perhaps the products would be R and S, but that depends on how the reduction proceeds.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the hydride addition. The hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the borate attacks the alpha carbon from the opposite side. So, the configuration of the alpha carbon in the starting material would influence the product's configuration.

So, if the starting material's alpha carbon is R, the borate would attack from the opposite side (leading to which configuration in the product?).

Wait, perhaps the product's configuration would be the opposite.

So, if the starting material is R, the product would be S, and vice versa.

In that case, the product from A (R) would require the starting material to be S. And the product from B (S) would require the starting material to be R.

Wait, that would mean that for A, which gives R, the starting material must be S. And for B, which gives S, the starting material must be R.

Looking at the options, that would be option C: A is S, B is R.

Because A when treated with LiBH4 gives R product, implying that the starting material A is S. Similarly, B is R, which upon treatment gives S product.

So that would fit option C.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this backward. Let me think again.

If the starting material's alpha carbon is R, then during reduction, the borate would attack from the opposite face, leading to the product's alpha carbon being S.

So, if the starting material is R, the product is S.

Similarly, if the starting material is S, the product is R.

In that case, for reaction A (using LiBH4) to give R product, the starting material must be S.

And for reaction B (using BH3) to give S product, the starting material must be R.

Which corresponds to option C: A is S, B is R.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is retained.

Wait, no, because the attack is from the opposite face.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing, but I think that option C is the correct one.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one using different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3. The product's stereochemistry depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent used.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) is influenced by the configuration of the starting material and the mechanism of the reduction. LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they may lead to different stereochemical outcomes due to differences in their reaction pathways.

The starting material is identified as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which has a chiral center at position 3. The configuration of this chiral center (R or S) determines the stereochemistry of the product. During the reduction, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the borate attacks the alpha carbon from the opposite side, leading to an anti addition. This mechanism means that the configuration of the starting material is inverted in the product.

For Reaction A, when the starting material is treated with LiBH4, it produces the (R)-configured product. This implies that the starting material must have the (S) configuration. Similarly, for Reaction B, when the starting material is treated with BH3, it produces the (S)-configured product. This implies that the starting material must have the (R) configuration.

Thus, the correct starting materials are:
- A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (to produce the (R)-product with LiBH4)
- B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (to produce the (S)-product with BH3)

This matches the stereochemical relationship described in Option C.

Answer: C
