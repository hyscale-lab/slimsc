Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I remember that IUPAC nomenclature can get tricky, especially when dealing with multiple substituents and their positions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The molecule has a benzene ring. The substituents mentioned are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Wait, meta to each otherâ€”so each of these three groups is in a position that's two carbons apart? Or maybe each is meta relative to the others. Hmm, perhaps they form a kind of triangle on the ring, each separated by two positions.

Let me sketch a benzene ring. Let me number the positions 1 through 6. So, if all three groups are meta, maybe each is two positions apart from the others. Let's say the carboxylic acid is in position 1. Then, the carbaldehyde (formyl group) would be in position 4, since that's meta to position 1. Similarly, the cyano would be in position 3 or 5? Wait, wait. If all three are meta to one another, perhaps their positions are arranged in such a way that each is two positions away from each other. Maybe positions 1, 3, and 5? No, because 1 and 3 are adjacent, which is meta. Wait, no, meta is two positions away. So in a benzene ring, position 1 and 3 are meta. Position 1 and 4 are para. So perhaps the three groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. But wait, the question says all are meta to one another. So maybe each substituent is meta to the others. That would require that each is two positions away from the others. So the ring has substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. But wait, in a benzene ring, the positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. Because each is two positions apart. Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but the question says "meta to one another," which might mean each group is meta to the others. So, I think the three substituents (carboxylic acid, formyl, cyano) are at positions 1,3,5. Let me note that
