Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two binary systems: system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations show their radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of the two stars' masses in each system.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the more massive star usually orbits more slowly because it's closer to the center of mass. But wait, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shifts of each star as they orbit. The amplitude of the RV curve depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination of the orbit (if edge-on, the amplitude is maximum). But in this problem, since both systems are eclipsing, their orbits must be aligned, so inclination is close to 90 degrees, so the RV amplitudes should directly relate to their masses.

But how do the RV amplitudes relate to the masses? Oh right, in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit (since it's closer to the center), so its velocity is lower. Wait, no, velocity depends on the
