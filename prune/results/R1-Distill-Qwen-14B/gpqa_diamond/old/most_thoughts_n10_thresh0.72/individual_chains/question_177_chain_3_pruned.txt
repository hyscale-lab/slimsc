Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. Interesting. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wavelength of maximum brightness. Oh right, that's the peak emission wavelength, which relates to temperature. So if both have the same peak wavelength, they must be at the same temperature. Because, you know, from Wien's Law: λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same, T is the same.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, wait. The peak wavelength depends on the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

But then, the question says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to find L1/L2.

Wait, but how? I remember the luminosity formula. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Since both stars have the same temperature, T1 = T2 = T. So L1/L2 would be (R1² T^4) / (R2² T^4) ) = (R1/R2)^2. Because T cancels out.

But wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh, but wait! The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect luminosity?

Hmm, but wait, luminosity is an intrinsic property. Radial velocity, which affects the observed brightness via the Doppler effect or something else?
