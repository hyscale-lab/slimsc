Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. Hmm, wait, aromatic compounds with C10H14... Oh right, that's probably toluene derivatives because toluene is C7H8, and if you add some substituents, maybe methyl groups or ethyl groups, you get up to C10H14.

The NMR spectrum shows two signals around 6.7 ppm, both singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I'm trying to remember what different substituents do in NMR. Let's think about the aromatic region first.

So the aromatic protons usually show up between 6.5-8.5 ppm. If it's a singlet, that suggests that the aromatic protons are all equivalent. Like, maybe if they're in a para position or something symmetric. But wait, the two signals each are singlets. So each compound contributes one set of aromatic protons, and they are all equivalent within each compound.

Wait, the mixture is 1:1, so the two signals at 6.7 ppm are each the same intensity because it's a 1:1 ratio. So each of these signals corresponds to one compound. So each compound has only one set of aromatic protons, and they're all equivalent, hence singlets.

Now let me think about the structures. The options given are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would have different substituents, so maybe that affects the NMR.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's check that. For the tetramethylbenzenes, each has four methyl groups, so benzene (C6H6) plus four CH3 groups. So each would be C10H14 (C6 + 4C= C10, H: 6- (each CH3 adds 3 H, but benzene has 6 H). Wait, wait, benzene is C6H6. Each methyl adds 3 H. So four methyl groups add 12 H, but benzene loses 6 H as they become substituted. Wait, no, each substitution replaces a H on benzene with a substituent. So four substituents would have 6 -4 = 2 H on the ring. But if all substituents are in positions that make those H equivalent, like in a para arrangement.

Wait, no. Let me think about this again. The molecular formula is C10H14 for each compound. So for benzene (C6H6), adding four methyl groups (each CH3) would give C6 + 4C = C10, and H: 6 + (4Ã—3) = 18 H? Wait that
