Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls vertically on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, they also mention that we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Alright, so first, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern observed on a screen (far away) depends on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, the diffraction pattern has minima at certain angles.

Wait, but in this case, the aperture is a polygon with N sides and all apothems equal. When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the shape approaches a circle. So maybe this problem is about a circular aperture. But wait, the options don't have exactly the same formula as a circular aperture, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the circular case's first minima is at θ = λ/(a), where a is the radius. But wait, in the single slit, the first minima is at θ = λ / d, where d is the slit width. For a single slit, the formula is a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order. The minima are at m=±1, ±2, etc., so the angle is θ = (mλ)/d. For the first minima, m=1, so θ = λ/d.

But wait, in a circular aperture, the minima are different. The first minima in a circular aperture occurs at θ = 1.22λ/a, where a is the radius. So that's the first dark ring. But if N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, so maybe the problem is considering a circular aperture case.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a single slit, the first minima is at θ1=λ/d, second at θ2=2λ/d. So the angular separation would be θ2 - θ1 = λ/d. But for a circular aperture
