Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. There are two reactions to consider, and I need to complete them and pick the major products based on steric hindrance and product stability.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as a base. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options are A to D, each giving possible products A and B.

Let me start with the first reaction. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a base and an enolate is formed, it can undergo an aldol addition or maybe a conjugate addition. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, which is a good Michael acceptor. So this might be a Michael addition reaction.

In Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the base t-BuOK would deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. But which position is more acidic? The ketone is at position 1, so the alpha carbons are positions 2 and 6. But wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1, and C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl. So the alpha positions are C2 and C6, but wait, that's not right. Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives: the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent (alpha) carbons are C2 and C6. But in this molecule, both C2 and C6 have substituents.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So:

- C1: carbonyl (O)
- C2: ethyl and methyl groups (so substituents)
- C6: methyl group.

So the possible alpha hydrogens are at C2 and C6. But because of the substituents, maybe the base will prefer to deprotonate a certain position. The
