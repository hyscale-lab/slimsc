Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let me break that down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. Ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the ketone group is on the first carbon. The substituents on the benzene ring would be at positions 3 and 5. Wait, because the numbering would be such that the ketone is attached to the ring, and the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So the ring has a nitro group at position 3, a bromine at position 5? Or maybe I got that mixed up. Let me visualize the benzene ring: the acetone is attached to carbon 1, and the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5 relative to that. So the ring has groups at meta positions relative to each other, but I'm a bit confused about their actual positions.

Wait, the substituents in the phenyl group attached to the ketone would be in specific positions. The name is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the phenyl group has a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5 relative to the point of attachment. So if the acetone is attached to position 1, then bromine is at position 3, nitro at position 5. So the ring would have substituents at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group.

Now, I need to plan how to introduce these groups. The starting material is benzene, so I have to go step by step, considering the reactions.

Synthesis steps often involve electrophilic substitution because benzene is typically unreactive except under those conditions.

So, the target has two nitro groups and a bromine. Wait, no, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl connected to a ketone (acetone). So the benzene ring attached to the ketone has a Br at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5.

Wait, the
