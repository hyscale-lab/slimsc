Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about space travel and time dilation, right? So here's the scenario: there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they have a super fast spacecraft. It's moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super close to the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years, but the astronaut is 22 years old. The question is, how long does the trip take from the astronaut's perspective, and will they live long enough to reach Earth.

Wait, so I remember that when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity. So from Earth's frame of reference, the trip would take a certain amount of time, but from the astronaut's perspective, it would be shorter because of the effects of relativity. Or wait, is it the other way around?

Wait, time dilation means that moving clocks run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. So if the spaceship is moving at a very high speed relative to Earth, someone on Earth would see the astronaut's clock as moving slowly. But from the astronaut's frame of reference, Earth is moving quickly, so the distance would be contracted.

Wait, but I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, so in this case, the astronaut's frame. Because the spaceship is
