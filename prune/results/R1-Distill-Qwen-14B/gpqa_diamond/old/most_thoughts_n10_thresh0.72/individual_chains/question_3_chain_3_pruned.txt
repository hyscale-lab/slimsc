Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. It's about expectation values for a spin-half particle. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the state vector and the operator. For an operator O, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So I'll need to compute this for the given operator.

First, I'll break down the operator. It's 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is the sum of the expectations of each term. So I can write ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Right, that makes sense because expectation values are linear. So I can compute each part separately.

I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state ψ.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me note that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, which means that σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So when I compute ⟨σz⟩, it's straightforward because the state is already an eigenstate of σz.

Wait, no, the state is a superposition. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is a linear combination, but the expectation of σz is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

Because ⟨σz⟩ = |a|^2*(1) + |b|^2*(-1), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

In this case, a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. And b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because wait: the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 and b=√3/2. Let me square them. a² = 0.25, b² = (3/4) = 0.75.

So, yes, ⟨σz⟩ is 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So that's the expectation value for σz. Now, the other part is ⟨σx⟩.

Hmm. σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, but our state is in the σz basis. So I'll have to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, σx can be expressed in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Let me recall that σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So let's compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

The state ψ is 0.5
