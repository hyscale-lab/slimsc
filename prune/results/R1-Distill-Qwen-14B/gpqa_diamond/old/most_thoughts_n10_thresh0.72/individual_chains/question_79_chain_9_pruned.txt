Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying compound X based on the NMR data of the reaction product. Hmm.

So, the reaction conditions are that compound X (C11H12O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. Oh right, it's usually used in the formation of epoxides, like in the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Wait, or is that another base? Alternatively, maybe it's used in some kind of elimination reaction or opening of epoxides? Hmm, wait, no, wait. Oh wait, if the compound X is an epoxide, then treating it with a base might cause a ring-opening. Or perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation, but wait, epoxidation typically uses peracids. Oh wait, no, Prilezhaev epoxidation uses a base like that, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe compound X is a diene, and the base induces some kind of reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product’s NMR data is given. So the product is the result after the reaction. So perhaps compound X is the starting material, maybe an epoxide, and the reaction opens it. Or perhaps it's a different reaction. Let me think about what the reaction conditions imply.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used to deprotonate things. So maybe the reaction is deprotonating something. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in the opening of an epoxide. Oh, wait, the product's NMR data shows certain signals. Let's analyze that.

Looking at the product’s 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s)
Wait, two singlets, each integrating to 3H. So two methyl groups. Maybe they are attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like attached to an oxygen or a double bond.

Then, 6.75
