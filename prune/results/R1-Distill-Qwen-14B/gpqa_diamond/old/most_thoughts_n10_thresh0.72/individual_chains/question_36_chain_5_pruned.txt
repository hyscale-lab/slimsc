Okay, so I have this question about interstellar medium observations and absorption lines. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that observations are being made at about 2.1 gigaparsecs away. The absorption line energy equivalent is 3.9 micro electron volts. So, what does that mean?

I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength. The formula is E = hc/λ, right? But wait, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. But the energy here is given in electron volts, which is a different unit. Oh, right, 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 joules.

So the energy E is 3.9e-6 eV. Let me convert that to joules: 3.9e-6 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV = 6.24e-25 J. Then, using E = hc/λ, rearranged to λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers: λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (6.24e-25 J)

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divide that by 6.24e-25:

1.9878e-25 /6.24e-25 ≈ 0.3185 meters. Wait, 0.3185 meters is about 31.85 centimeters. But that's a really long wavelength. Wait, visible light is in nanometers, much smaller. So 30 cm is way beyond radio waves. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the energy given is the rest energy, but perhaps it's something else. Or maybe it's not about the photon's energy but the ionization potential or something else. Oh wait, maybe it's about the energy per particle — like for an absorption line, the energy corresponds to the transition in an atom.

Wait, another approach: 3.9 micro eV is a very small energy. Let me think about common interstellar medium components. I know
