Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're supposed to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity (L) of a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait a second. If Star_2 has a higher velocity, does that affect the observed wavelength? Because radial velocity can cause a Doppler shift. Oh yeah, that's right. The star's motion can shift the observed wavelength. So maybe the observed λ_max is different from the emitted λ_max. Hmm, so I need to consider that.

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So for Star_2, the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's. So the Doppler shift must adjust for that.

Wait, but Star_1 has radial velocity zero, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me think: radial velocity affects the observed wavelength via the Doppler effect. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait
