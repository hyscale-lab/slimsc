Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Astronomers are looking at the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm. I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, in this problem, the ratio is n1/n2. Because without spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower, so when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, the ratio when no spots is R0 = (n1/n2)_0, and when spots are present, it's R1 = (n1/n2)_1. We're looking for R0/R1, I think.

Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R1 = R0 * factor, with factor <1. Wait, no. If the star with spots has a lower ratio, then R_spot = R0 * (something less than 1). So the factor by which R0 is bigger than R_spot is 1/(R_spot/R0) = R0/R_spot. Let me clarify:

When the star doesn't have spots (case 1), the Teff is 6000 K. When it has spots (case 2), the Teff is 5500 K. The observed ratio n1/n2 is higher in case 1 than in case 2. So the ratio decreases when spots are present.

The ratio is n1/n2. Let me write the expressions for both cases.

Case 1: n1_1 / n2_1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )

Case 2: n1_2 / n2_2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The
