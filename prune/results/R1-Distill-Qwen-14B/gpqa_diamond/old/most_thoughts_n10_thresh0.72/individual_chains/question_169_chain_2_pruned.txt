Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this nuclear decay problem. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Now, there's a variant where instead of two V particles, one exotic, massless particle M is emitted. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E changes in this new decay.

Hmm. I remember that in nuclear decays, the energy distribution of emitted particles depends on what else is being emitted and their masses. Also, whether the particles are massive or massless might play a role here.

In the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. I think that when you have multiple particles emitted, the energy spectrum can be continuous if the decay allows for a range of energy distributions among the products. The endpoint Q is the maximum energy that an E particle can have, which probably occurs when the other E and all V particles take the least possible energy, maybe zero if they're massless or something.

Wait, but in the original case, 2E and 2V are emitted. If V has some mass, that must affect the energy. But in the variant, instead of 2V, a single M (which is massless) is emitted. So the decay becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the conservation laws here. Momentum and energy must be conserved. When particles are emitted, their energies and momenta have to add up correctly.

In the original decay, when 2E and 2V are emitted, their energies are spread out. The E particles have a continuous spectrum because their energies can vary, given that the V particles can adjust their momenta accordingly. The endpoint Q is the maximum energy an E can have when the other E and all Vs are at their minimum energies, perhaps when they're moving in the same direction as the E, meaning they take away as little energy as possible.

Wait, but in the original scenario, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. So maybe this is similar to beta decay, where the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because the antineutrino carries away some energy.

In the modified decay, instead of two V particles, one M is emitted. Let's imagine M is massless. So in the original,
