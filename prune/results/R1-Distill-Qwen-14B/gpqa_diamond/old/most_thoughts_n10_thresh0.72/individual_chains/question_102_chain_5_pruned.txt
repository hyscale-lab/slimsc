Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a gene targeting experiment. Let me go through it step by step.

So the setup is that someone has a ligand-receptor pair, both initially expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate by using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. A bicistronic vector means it has two coding regions (cistrons) under a single promoter, right?

The vector structure: The ligand's ORF is first, at the 5' end, and it's fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can be expressed from the same mRNA as the ligand.

Wait, but there are stop cassettes in between. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So in the construct, the ligand is followed by a stop that's flanked by loxP sites, and the receptor has a different stop flanked by lox2272. I remember that Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and can excise the region between them if they are in a certain configuration.

Now, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Cre is under the control of SOX10, so it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for fluorescence. But they don't see a green signal. The green would come from eGFP, which is on the receptor. So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, or isn't fluorescent for some reason.

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. So acting on different cells. Not sure how that affects expression though.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. Maybe, but why wouldn't it express? The Western blot was done, so maybe they saw the proteins. But the question says they use antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on Western. So if the proteins are expressed and detected, but not in the right place, maybe. But wait, the Western blot result tells us that the expression isn't the issue. Because in the question, the researcher did a Western blot after plasmid transfection into primary astrocyte culture. So maybe the construct works in culture but not in the mice when Cre is used.

Wait, but the actual experiment is with the mouse model. The construct is in the mouse, and they crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is supposed to excise certain parts.

Let me think about the vector setup again. The ligand is under CBA promoter, then the IRES drives the receptor. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning both the ligand and receptor are on the same transcript, using the IRES for the receptor.

But the stop cassettes complicate things. So before the ligand's mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP sites. Similarly, the receptor has a stop cassette with lox2272.

So in the construct, the ligand is followed by a stop, which is flanked by loxP. The receptor is after an IRES, and has a stop flanked by lox2272.

When Cre is introduced, which Cre variant? Because Cre can recognize loxP sites. But lox2272 is a variant that doesn't recombine with lo
