Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's given and what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are provided: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the three dissociation constants for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- or maybe PO4^3-? Wait, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The first dissociation gives H2PO4^-, the second gives HPO4^2-, and the third gives PO4^3-.

Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So we're looking for [HPO4^2-] in the solution.

Hmm, okay, so the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer solution. So in this case, KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (the acid), and Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base, HPO4^2-.

Wait, wait. Let me think about their structures. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- in solution. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (plus water, but that's already accounted for in the formula).

So the mixture here is a buffer of H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). The relevant equilibrium here is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+. The Ka for this is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So in a buffer solution, the concentration of the conjugate base and the weak acid are related by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

But wait, I don't know the pH here. Alternatively, I can use the ratio of the concentrations to find the concentrations of each species. Since the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will influence each other.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the concentration of orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-. So maybe I need to find how
