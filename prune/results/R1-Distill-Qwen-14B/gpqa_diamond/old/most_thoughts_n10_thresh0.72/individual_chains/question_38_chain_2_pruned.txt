Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the product and the correct sequence of reagents. Let me start by breaking down what's given.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me draw the structure. So, the main part is an ethanaminium ion. The ethanaminium would have a positive charge on the nitrogen. The substituents are N-methyl and N-pentan-2-ylidene. Oh wait, the pentan-2-ylidene group is a double bond—so it's a substituted ethylidene group. So the structure is like CH₂=CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃) attached to the nitrogen, which is also connected to a methyl group and an ethanaminium positive charge. So maybe it's something like [N(CH3)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)CH2CH2]+? Wait, maybe I should write it as N-methyl, with the other substituent being pentan-2-ylidene, which is a double bond. So the structure is N-methyl, and attached via a double bond to a pentyl group—so the double bond is at position 2 of the pentyl chain.

So the molecule looks like: the ethanaminium cation with two substituents—methyl and a CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH3 group connected
