Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. I need to find out which starting materials (A and B) are correct from the given options.

Hmm, wait, the reagents used are NaNO2, HCl, and H2O. Oh right, that sounds familiar. I remember that this is the conditions for the Stephen reduction. Oh wait, wait, no, Stephen reduction uses HCl and H2O with a nitrous acid, right? So it's for the reduction of carbonyl groups, maybe ketones or aldehydes. Wait, no, wait. Stephen reduction is for aromatic ketones, I think. It converts aromatic ketones into aldehydes. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, sodium nitrite and HCl in acidic conditions, maybe it's a diazotization reaction, but that's usually with amines. Oh wait, no, waitâ€”diketones are being formed. So maybe the starting materials have adjacent alcohols that get oxidized to ketones.

Wait, wait, another thought. Sodium nitrite and HCl in aqueous conditions... I think that's the Tollen's reagent conditions, but that's for aldehydes. Or maybe it's a kind of oxidation. Alternatively, maybe it's the conditions for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that uses
