Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says we have a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. The magnetic field is 1 Tesla, and m is small, so I guess that means the orbital magnetic quantum number isn't too large. The task is to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy due to the magnetic interaction, with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is in the visible range, like maybe the Balmer series? Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is around 656 nm, but wait, 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is blue-green. That's the H-alpha line, I think. Or wait, maybe H-beta is 486 nm. So the transition is probably between n=4 to n=2 or something like that.

But wait, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen. The formula for the energy levels in hydrogen is E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So if the wavelength is λ, the energy ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ.

Let me calculate that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 µm, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So ΔE = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6).

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Wait, no, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m? Wait, 6.626 *3 is about 19.878, times 1e-34+8= e-26? Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = (6.626*3) * 1e(-34+8) )= 19.878e-26 J·m?

Wait, wait: 1e-34 multiplied by 1e8 is 1e-26. So 6.626 *3 is 19.878, so 19.878e-26 J·m.

Then divide by λ=0.4861e-6 meters.

So ΔE = (19.878e-26 J·m) / (0.4861e-6 m) )= (19.878e-26) / (
