Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma rays annihilating with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's almost uniformly present in the universe. The question is asking about the energy at which high-energy gamma rays' lifetimes are limited by this process. 

The reaction given is γγ → e+ e-. So, a gamma-ray photon colliding with another photon (from CMB) creates an electron and a positron. I think this process is about photon-photon interactions, which I remember is a topic in high-energy astrophysics or particle physics.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. I think that's about right because I remember the CMB temperature is around 2.7 K, and using blackbody radiation, the peak is in the microwave region. So, each CMB photon has low energy.

Now, the question is about the gamma-ray's energy. So I need to find the threshold energy where gamma rays can annihilate with CMB photons effectively. Wait, but how does the lifetime limit come into play here?

Oh, right! High-energy particles like gamma rays can lose energy through various interactions. In this case, they're annihilating with CMB photons. The more likely this process is, the shorter the lifetime of the gamma-ray photons because they get converted into other particles (electron-positron pairs here). So, the lifetime is inversely related to the interaction rate.

The interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target photons. Since the CMB is isotropic and everywhere, the number of target photons is high. But the cross-section for photon-photon interactions, especially pair production, probably depends on the energy of the photons involved.

I remember that for pair production (γγ → e+ e-), the process is only possible if the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass of the electron (since each electron has rest mass ~0.511 MeV). So the threshold condition is when the sum of their energies meets that requirement. 

Wait, but in the center-of-mass frame, the sum of the energies should be at least 2 * m_e * c². Since m_e is about 0.511 MeV, that's 1.022 MeV in total. So each photon needs to have enough energy when considering their relative motion.

But wait, in this case, one photon is the high-energy gamma, and the other is the CMB photon with energy E_cmb. So the process is more feasible when the gamma's energy is such that E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Because for two colliding particles, the condition is E1 E2 (1 - cosθ) >= (m_e c²)^2, but I think in the case when they're moving in opposite directions (like in the case of a gamma moving through a bath of CMB photons), the angle θ is 180 degrees, so cosθ is -1, and 1 - (-1) = 2. So the condition becomes E_gamma * E_cmb * 2 >= (m_e c²)^2.

So the threshold condition is E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c²)^2 / 2. Let me write that down:

E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c²)^2 / 2

We can rearrange this to find E_gamma:

E_gamma >= (m_e c²)^2 / (2 * E_cmb)

But wait, m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, right? So (0.511 MeV)^2 is (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2. Let me compute that: 0.511^2 is about 0.261. So (0.261) (MeV)^2. Then, the denominator is 2 * E_cmb. E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV. Oh, but wait, that's a very low energy. Let me convert everything to the same units.

Wait, E_cmb is 1e-3 eV. Let's convert that to MeV because m_e c² is in MeV. Since 1 eV is 1e-6 MeV, so 1e-3 eV is 1e-9 MeV. So E_cmb = 1e-9 MeV.

So plugging into the equation:

E_gamma >= (0.511^2 (MeV)^2 ) / ( 2 * 1e-9 MeV )

Let me compute the numerator: (0.511)^2 = approximately 0.261 (units are (MeV)^2).

Denominator: 2 * 1e-9 MeV = 2e-9 MeV.

So the whole thing is:

E_gamma >= (0.261 (MeV)^2) / (2e-9 MeV) 

Which simplifies to:

(0.261 / 2e-9 ) * (MeV^2 / MeV) ) → (0.1305e9) MeV 

Wait, 0.261 / 2 = 0.1305, and 1e9 because it's 1e-9 in the denominator.

So, 0.1305e9 MeV = 1.305e8 MeV. 

But wait, 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 1e8 MeV is 1e5 GeV. So 1.305e8 MeV is 1.305e5 GeV. 

Wait, but this seems low. Wait, 1e8 MeV is 1e5 GeV because 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 1e3 MeV = 1 GeV. So 1e8 MeV = 1e5 GeV (because 1e8 / 1e3 = 1e5).

So 1.305e5 GeV is 1.305 × 1e5 GeV. Let me see the options:

Options are A) 9.5e4 GeV, B) 1.8e5, C) 2.6e5, D) 3.9e5.

Hmm, my calculation gives around 1.3e5 GeV, but none of the options exactly match that. Closest is option B) 1.8e5. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

E_gamma >= (m_e c²)^2/(2 E_cmb)

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV

(m_e c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2 = 0.261 (MeV)^2.

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV = 1e-9 MeV.

So:

E_gamma >= (0.261 (MeV)^2) / (2 * 1e-9 MeV) )

Divide numerator and denominator:

= 0.261 / (2e-9) * (MeV^2 / MeV) 

= (0.261 / 2e-9) MeV 

= 0.1305e9 MeV 

Which is 1.305e8 MeV → 1.305e5 GeV (since 1 GeV=1e3 MeV → 1e3 MeV=1 GeV).

1.305e5 GeV is 130,500 GeV, and the options are in the 1e5 range.

Option B is 1.8e5 GeV, which is 180,000 GeV. Hmm, maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section or the calculation of the threshold condition is different. Let me think again.

Wait, the threshold condition for pair production from two photons is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2m_e c². So, the condition is:

E1 + E2 >= 2 m_e c²

But wait, that's when the photons are moving in the same direction. Wait, no. Wait, actually, when the two photons are moving in opposite directions, the center-of-mass energy is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 ), because their momenta are opposite. Since photons have p = E/(c), so p1 = E1/(c), p2 = E2/(c) in opposite directions.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 c^2?

Wait, the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 c^2? No, wait, the four-momentum is (E, pc), so when two photons collide, the total four-momentum is (E1 + E2, p1 c - p2 c) if they're moving in opposite directions. Because p1 is in one direction, p2 in the opposite.

So the square of the total four-momentum is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 (since the spatial part is a vector and direction matters). 

For pair production, this must be >= (2 m_e c²)^2.

So,

(E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 >= (2 m_e c²)^2.

But for photons, E = p c, so p = E/(c). So,

(E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c) c - (E2/c) c )^2 >= (2 m_e c²)^2

Simplify:

(E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 >= (2 m_e c²)^2

Expand both squares:

= [ E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2² ] - [ E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2² ]

= E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2² - E1² + 2 E1 E2 - E2² 

= 4 E1 E2 

So,

4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2 / 4 * (since 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c²)^2 / (4) )

Wait, wait, that simplifies to E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2 / 4.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the correct condition is E1 * E2 >= (m_e c²)^2 /4.

So in our case, E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E2 is the CMB photon energy.

Assuming the gamma is much more energetic than the CMB photon, so E1 >> E2. Thus, the condition becomes E1 * E2 >= (m_e c²)^2 /4.

So,

E1 >= (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E2 )

Wait, that's different from before. So earlier, I mistakenly used a factor of 2 instead of 4 in the denominator.

So redoing the calculation with this correct condition.

E_gamma * E_cmb >= (0.511 MeV)^2 /4 

Compute (0.511)^2 = 0.261, so 0.261/4 ≈ 0.06525 (units in (MeV)^2)

E_cmb is 1e-3 eV = 1e-9 MeV.

So,

E_gamma >= (0.06525 (MeV)^2 ) / (1e-9 MeV )

Which is 0.06525e9 MeV = 6.525e7 MeV.

Convert to GeV: 6.525e7 MeV = 6.525e4 GeV.

Wait, 6.525e4 GeV is 6.525 × 1e4 GeV, which is 65,250 GeV or 6.525e4 GeV.

Looking at the options, option A is 9.5e4 GeV, which is 95,000 GeV. Hmm, but my calculation says 6.5e4 GeV. That's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations again. Let me recalculate.

E_gamma >= (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_cmb )

m_e c² is 0.511 MeV → (0.511 MeV)^2 = 0.261 (MeV)^2.

Divide by 4 E_cmb:

= 0.261 / (4 * 1e-9 MeV) ) → 0.261 / 4 = 0.06525, so 0.06525 / 1e-9 MeV = 6.525e-8 MeV^-1 ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of units.

Wait, E_gamma has units of MeV, E_cmb is in MeV as well.

So,

E_gamma (MeV) = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (4 * E_cmb (MeV) )

E_cmb is 1e-3 eV = 1e-9 MeV.

So,

E_gamma = (0.511^2) / (4 * 1e-9) 

= 0.261 / (4e-9) 

= 0.06525e9 MeV 

= 6.525e7 MeV 

= 6.525e4 GeV 

Because 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, so 6.525e7 MeV = 6.525e4 GeV.

Hmm, but this doesn't match any of the options. The options are:

A)9.5e4 GeV → 95,000 GeV

B)1.8e5 → 180,000 GeV

C)2.6e5 → 260,000 GeV

D)3.9e5 → 390,000 GeV

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Because the process is photon-photon pair production, and the cross-section might depend not just on the threshold but also on the energy. Maybe I should consider the photon density and the interaction rate.

Wait, the problem is asking about the energy where the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process. So perhaps I need to calculate the interaction rate (gamma photons annihilating with CMB photons) and set the mean free time equal to some timescale, but perhaps the question is only about the threshold energy, not the rate.

Wait, the question says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process". So, that's about the energy where the interaction becomes significant enough to limit the lifetime. So perhaps the gamma's lifetime is determined by the time it takes for the gamma to interact with a CMB photon, on average.

Mean free time τ is given by τ = 1 / n σ v_rel, where n is the number density of target photons, σ is the cross-section, and v_rel is the relative velocity.

But the cross-section σ for photon-photon pair production increases as the energy increases. At high energies, σ ~ E^2 / m_e^4, but I'm not sure about the exact dependence.

Wait, the cross-section for two-photon pair production is given by:

σ ≈ ( (4 π/3) ) (α^2 / m_e^4 c^4) ) ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (E1 E2) )

Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. From what I recall, the cross-section for γγ→e+e− increases with the energy of the photons. The cross-section is proportional to (1/(E1 E2)) × (something with energy). Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is σ ∝ 1/(E1 E2) ) × (E_total)^2 or something like that.

Wait, another approach: the cross-section for photon-photon pair production can be approximated as:

σ ≈ (8 π/3) (α^2 / m_e^4) ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (E1 E2) )

Where α is the fine-structure constant (~1/137). Let me check the units: the cross-section should be in cm².

But maybe for our purposes, the exact formula isn't needed, but rather the scaling with energy.

Assuming E1 is much larger than E2 (E1 >> E2), then E2 can be approximated as the CMB energy, which is much smaller than E1.

So, cross-section σ ∝ ( (m_e c^2)^2 )/(E1 E2) )

Since E2 is known (1e-3 eV), and E1 is the gamma energy, we can write σ ∝ ( (0.511 MeV)^2 )/(E1 * (1e-3 eV)) )

But wait, the units for E2 are in eV, so I should convert them to MeV.

E2 = 1e-3 eV = 1e-9 MeV.

So,

σ ∝ ( (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2 ) / ( E1 (MeV) * (1e-9 MeV) ) )

Simplify:

σ ∝ (0.261 MeV^2 ) / ( 1e-9 E1 MeV^2 )

Which gives:

σ ∝ 0.261 / (1e-9 E1 ) → σ ∝ 2.61e8 / E1 

So, σ is inversely proportional to E1.

But then, the interaction rate Γ is proportional to σ * n * v_rel, where n is the number density of photons.

The number density n of CMB photons is known. The CMB has a temperature T, and the photon number density can be found from the formula for a photon gas:

n = (g_{\gamma} / (2π^2)) ) (k_B T)^3 / (h^3 / c^3 )

Where g_γ is the degrees of freedom for photons (g=2 for photons, since they have two polarizations, but perhaps g=2? Or g=2 for each type?)

Alternatively, the number density is about n ≈ 411 photons/cm^3. Wait, I think the CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cubic centimeter. But I should confirm.

Yes, the CMB photon density is about 411 cm^-3. So, n ≈ 411 cm^-3 → which is 411 × 1e6 m^-3 (since 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³).

Wait, actually, 1 cm^-3 is 1e6 m^-3. So n = 411 cm^-3 = 411e6 m^-3.

Now, the relative velocity v_rel for the gamma photons. Since the CMB is isotropic and the universe is expanding, but for the purpose of calculating the interaction rate, the relative velocity can be approximated as the speed of light, since photons are moving at c.

So, v_rel ≈ c.

Putting it all together, the interaction rate Γ is:

Γ ≈ σ * n * c 

The mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the interaction rate: τ = 1/Γ.

But the problem is about when the lifetime is limited by this process. So, when the interaction rate becomes so high that the gamma-ray photon quickly annihilates. So, we need to find the gamma energy where the interaction rate is high enough that the lifetime is limited.

But perhaps, the calculation is more straightforward by finding the energy where the photon-photon cross-section is such that the mean free path is comparable to the size of the universe or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the threshold energy for the reaction to happen, which is the minimum energy needed for the pair production.

Wait, earlier, I found that the threshold condition is E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2 /4. So, E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2/(4 E2 )

Plugging in the numbers:

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So,

E1 >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (4 * 1e-3 eV )

Compute numerator: (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 = 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

Denominator: 4 * 1e-3 = 4e-3 eV.

So,

E1 >= (2.61e11 eV^2) / (4e-3 eV) ) = (2.61e11) / (4e-3) eV

= (2.61 /4) * 1e14 eV 

= 0.6525 * 1e14 eV 

= 6.525e13 eV 

Convert eV to GeV: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV → 6.525e13 eV = 6.525e4 GeV = 65,250 GeV.

Hmm, 6.5e4 GeV. But the options don't have this. The closest is option A) 9.5e4 GeV. But that's 95,000 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the CMB photon energy is not 1e-3 eV but 1e-3 times the Planck energy or something else. No, the CMB average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-section formula. Another approach: the cross-section for pair production γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ ≈ (8 π/3) (α^2) (m_e^2 c^4) )/(E1 E2) ) * [ something ]

Wait, wait, perhaps the correct expression is σ ≈ (8 π/3) (α²) (m_e^4 c^6) )/( (E1 E2)^3 ) ) × something. No, perhaps I should look for the standard formula.

Alternatively, I can look for the expression from the photon-photon cross-section. The cross-section for pair production is known and given by:

σ = (8 π/3) (α^2) (m_e^4 c^6) )/( (E1 E2) (E1 + E2) ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the cross-section can be approximated as:

σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) ) * (m_e c^2)^2 )/( E1 E2 ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: the threshold energy is when the product E1 E2 is about (m_e c^2)^2 /4. So, the minimum energy for E1 is when E1 is (m_e c^2)^2/(4 E2).

Earlier, I got 6.5e4 GeV, but none of the options are close. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, maybe the correct threshold condition is E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / (2). Let me recalculate that.

E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / (2 E2 )

Then,

E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (2 * 1e-3 eV )

= (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2 ) / (2e-3 eV )

= (0.261e12 eV^2 ) / 2e-3 eV 

= 0.261e12 / 2e-3 eV 

= (0.261 / 2) * 1e15 eV 

= 0.1305e15 eV 

= 1.305e14 eV → 1.305e5 GeV.

Ah, that's about 1.3e5 GeV. Now, looking at the options, option B is 1.8e5 GeV, which is higher. So perhaps I should re-examine the threshold condition.

Wait, I think I confused myself earlier. The correct threshold condition is when the center-of-mass energy is 2 m_e c². The correct condition is E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2 /4, as derived earlier. So perhaps the correct calculation gives 6.5e4 GeV, but the options don't have that. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves considering the energy density of the CMB and the critical energy where the photon's lifetime is limited by the interaction. Maybe using the age of the universe as a timescale, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach is to consider the interaction rate Γ. The lifetime τ is 1/Γ. The interaction rate is Γ = n σ v.

n is the number density of CMB photons. Let me find n. The CMB photon density is about n = (4 a T^3 )/(h^3 c^3 ), where a is the radiation constant, T is the temperature, h is Planck's constant, etc. Alternatively, using T = 2.7 K.

But perhaps an approximate value is better. At T = 2.7 K, the number density n is about 411 photons/cm³, which is 411e6 photons/m³.

So, n ≈ 411e6 m^-3.

The cross-section σ for γγ → e+e- is approximately σ ≈ (8 π α^2 m_e^4 c^6 )/(3 E1^2 E2^2 ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I found a formula online before that:

σ = ( (8 π α^2) / (3 m_e^2 c^4) ) ( (m_e c^2)^2 )^2 ) / (E1 E2 (E1 + E2)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the cross-section expression. Alternatively, since I don't have the exact formula, I can proceed with the assumption that the cross-section scales as σ ∝ 1/(E1 E2) ) × (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, another approach. The cross-section for this process is given by:

σ ≈ ( (4 π/3) (α^2) (m_e c^2)^2 )/( E1 E2 ) )

So, σ = (4 π α² (m_e c²)^2 )/( 3 E1 E2 )

Then, the interaction rate Γ = n σ c.

n is the photon density, which is 411e6 m^-3.

So,

Γ = n * (4 π α² (m_e c²)^2 )/( 3 E1 E2 ) ) * c

We can write this as:

Γ = (4 π α² n c (m_e c²)^2 ) / (3 E1 E2 )

The lifetime τ is 1/Γ.

But the problem is when the lifetime is limited. So perhaps when τ is of the order of the age of the universe, but I'm not given any timescale here. Wait, perhaps the question is simply about the threshold where the process becomes possible, so the minimum energy is when E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2 /4.

So, E1 = (m_e c^2)^2/(4 E2 )

Plugging in the numbers again.

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

E2 = 1e-3 eV.

E1 = (0.511e6 eV )² / (4 * 1e-3 eV ) 

= (0.261e12 eV^2 ) / (4e-3 eV )

= 0.261e12 /4e-3 eV 

= (0.261 /4) e15 eV 

= 0.06525e15 eV 

= 6.525e13 eV 

= 6.525e4 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV).

Hmm, 6.5e4 GeV is 65,000 GeV. But the options are A) 9.5e4, B)1.8e5, etc. So none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the CMB photon energy is not 1e-3 eV but 1e-3 times something else. Let me double-check the question statement. Oh, it says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in exponents. Let me recheck.

E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (4 * 1e-3 eV )

= (0.511^2 *1e12 eV^2 ) / (4e-3 eV )

= (0.261 * 1e12 eV^2 ) / (4e-3 eV )

= 0.261e12 eV^2 / 4e-3 eV 

= 0.261e12 /4e-3 eV 

= (0.261 /4) * 1e15 eV 

= 0.06525e15 eV → 6.525e13 eV → 6.525e4 GeV.

Hmm, same result as before. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Maybe I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the CMB photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, but I should have used keV instead. Wait, no, the question says 1e-3 eV.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is E1 * E2 >= (m_e c²)^2 → so E1 >= (m_e c²)^2 / (E2 )

Then,

E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV )

= 0.261e12 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV 

= 0.261e15 eV → 2.61e14 eV → 2.61e5 GeV.

Which is option C: 2.6e5 GeV.

Ah, so perhaps I had a mistake in the threshold condition earlier. I thought it was 4 E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2, but perhaps it's actually E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2.

In that case, E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV )

= (0.261e12 eV^2 ) / (1e-3 eV )

= 0.261e15 eV → 2.61e14 eV → 2.61e5 GeV.

Which matches option C) 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, but earlier I thought the threshold condition was 4 E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2. So why is this conflicting?

Wait, I think I need to make this clear. The reaction γγ → e+ e- requires that the center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c^2. The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

But for photons, E=p c, so:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

So,

4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2 )^2 → E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2 )^2.

So threshold is E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2 )^2.

Ah! That's the correct condition. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought the condition was 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2 )^2 which would be E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2 )^2.

So, the correct condition is E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2 )^2.

So, E1 >= (m_e c^2 )^2 / E2.

Plugging in the numbers:

E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV )

= (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2 ) / (1e-3 eV )

= (0.261e12 eV^2 ) / 1e-3 eV 

= 0.261e15 eV → 2.61e14 eV.

Convert eV to GeV: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV → 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Which matches option C) 2.6e5 GeV.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays for which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The process requires that the center-of-mass energy of the two photons is at least equal to twice the rest energy of the electron, $2m_e c^2$. The invariant $s$ for the interaction is given by:

\[
s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (p_1 c - p_2 c)^2,
\]

where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the gamma-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_1$ and $p_2$ are their momenta. For photons, $E = pc$, so the invariant simplifies to:

\[
s = 4E_1E_2.
\]

The threshold condition for pair production is:

\[
s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2,
\]

which translates to:

\[
4E_1E_2 \geq (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_1$ (the gamma-ray energy):

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}.
\]

### Substituting the Known Values:
- The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$.
- The average energy of a CMB photon is $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$.

Plugging these into the formula:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}.
\]

First, calculate $(0.511 \times 10^6)^2$:

\[
(0.511)^2 = 0.261, \quad (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_1 \geq 0.261 \times 10^{15} / 10^9 = 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Matching with the Options:
The calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$, which corresponds to option **C**.

### Conclusion:
The energy of gamma-rays for which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.
