Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the same carbon. So, I think this is a nucleophilic addition reaction. 

When ketones react with nitriles, I remember that the reaction typically involves something like a cyanide ion attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrin formation is when a nucleophile like CN- adds to a carbonyl group, and then the oxygen becomes hydroxyl.

But wait, for that to happen under what conditions? I think the reaction usually needs an acid catalyst. Because the CN- isn't a strong enough nucleophile without some activation. So, maybe reagent A is something that provides an acidic environment. Like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or maybe something else like H2SO4 or NaHSO3? Because sometimes the formation of cyanohydrin can be done with HCN and a sulfuric acid as a catalyst. 

Wait, but the reaction here uses NaCN and another re
