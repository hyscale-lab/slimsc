Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the constant, the more the complex will form.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, the blue one must be a specific complex, maybe the one with two SCN- ligands? Or maybe four? Let me see. Oh wait, the problem mentions the stability constants β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β corresponds to the complex with a certain number of SCN- ions.

Wait, wait. So for Co(II) complexes, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+, [Co(SCN)2]^n+, etc., up to four SCN, since β4 is given. Each β is the formation constant for the nth complex.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^{2-n} or something like that. But the specific charge might not matter for this calculation.

We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Assuming that dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} or [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} or perhaps [Co(SCN)_2]^{n} complex. But I think the charge isn't the focus here; the main thing is the number of ligands, which affects the stability constant.

So the problem gives the concentrations: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, wait. So each β corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for the monomeric complex, β2 for the dimer, etc. So the complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4.

Wait, no. Wait, the stability constants are for the stepwise formation. Or are they overall? Oh yeah, I think βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions.

So the complexes are:

Co²+ with SCN^- ligands
