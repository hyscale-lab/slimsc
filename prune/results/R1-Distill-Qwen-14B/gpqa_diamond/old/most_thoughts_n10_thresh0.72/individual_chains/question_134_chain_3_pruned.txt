Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question says we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. We need to find the enthalpy change, and the options are given in kcal and kJ, so I should probably keep track of the units carefully.

Wait, wait. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. I remember the standard value is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this is a specific case with different concentrations and amounts. So I can't just use that directly; I need to calculate the moles and see which acid or base is the limiting reagent.

First, let me figure out the moles of each substance.

HCl is a strong acid, and it's monoprotic, so each mole gives one H+ ion. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. So moles HCl = 0.1.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is a diprotic acid. But wait, in the first dissociation, it's strong, so H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4. So moles of H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^- when dissolved. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M, so 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. So moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, so total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

But wait, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent is OH- because 0.2 < 0.28. So all OH- will be neutralized, and there will be some H+ left.

So the amount of H
