Okay, so I've got this physics problem about annihilation. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question is about a proton and an antiproton annihilating and producing two particles each of charge + and -. So the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, but the particles are A⁺ and A⁻. So each A must have a certain mass.

The given data is m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the rest energy of each A particle is 300 MeV. The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Oh, wait, the question says the antiproton is "slowly moving." That likely implies that its speed is low compared to the speed of light, so we can consider it's non-relativistic? Or perhaps it's the opposite? Wait, wait, no. If it's moving slowly, maybe we can treat it as non-relativistic, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

Wait a second, but the process is annihilation, which usually involves high energies, but perhaps in this case, the initial kinetic energy is low. So the total energy comes from the proton and antiproton. Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here.

So, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton is at rest? Or is the antiproton at rest? Wait, the problem says the
