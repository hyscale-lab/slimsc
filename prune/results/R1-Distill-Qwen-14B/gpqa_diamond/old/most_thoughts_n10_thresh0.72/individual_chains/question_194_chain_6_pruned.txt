Alright, so I've got this problem about spin systems and partition functions. Hmm, I remember that partition functions are important in statistical mechanics because they help calculate thermodynamic properties. But I'm a bit rusty, so let me think through this step by step.

The problem says we have three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, I recall that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible configurations of the spins and compute the energy for each, then sum the exponentials.

First, let's figure out how many possible states there are. Each spin can be +1 or -1, and there are three spins. So the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. That's manageable. I can list them all if needed.

But before I list all possibilities, maybe there's a smarter way. The energy expression involves the sum of the products of each pair. Let me see: E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me think about each term.

Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. Because S_i and S_j are each ±1, their product is 1 if they're the same and -1 if different. So each term in the sum can be ±1.

Let me compute the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. The energy is E = -J * S.

Wait, but the sum S can take various values. Let me find all possible values of S.

Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compute E for each possible state. Let's try that.

Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. Since each can be +1 or -1, there are 8 states. Let me list them:

1. (1,1,1)
2. (1,1,-1)
3. (1,-1,1)
4. (1,-1,-1)
5. (-1,1,1)
6. (-1,1,-1)
7. (-1,-1,1)
8. (-1,-1,-1)

Now, for each of these, compute E.

Let's compute each term step by step.

Case 1: (1,1,1)
S1S2 = 1*1 =1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum S = 3 → E = -J *3 → E = -3J

Case 2: (1,1,-1)
S1S2 =1 → S1S3= -1 → S2S3= -1
Sum S = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J

Wait, wait. Wait, the sum S is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Case 3: (1,-1,1)
S1S2 = -1 → S1S3 =1 → S2S3= -1
Sum S: (-1) +1 + (-1) → sum is (-1) → E= J.

Case4: (1,-1,-1)
S1S2 =-1 → S1S3=-1 → S2S3=1
Sum S: (-1) + (-1) +1 → sum is (-1) → E = J.

Case5: (-1,1,1)
S1S2 =-1 → S1S3= -1 → S2S3=1
Sum S: (-1) + (-1) +1 → sum is (-1) → E= J.

Case6: (-1,1,-1)
S1S2 =-1 → S1S3=1 → S2S3= -1
Sum S: (-1) +1 + (-1) → sum is (-1) → E= J.

Case7: (-1,-1,1)
S1S2 =1 → S1S3= -1 → S2S3= -1
Sum S:1 + (-1) + (-1) → sum is (-1) → E= J.

Case8: (-1,-1,-1)
S1S2=1 → S1S3=1 → S2S3=1
Sum S:3 → E = -3J.

Wait, so looking at all cases:

Out of the 8 states, two of them (cases 1 and 8) have E = -3J
