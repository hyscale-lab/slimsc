Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And we're given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things, and the temperature is 25°C, which probably doesn't affect much here since K is given.

Wait, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the formation constant K represents how strong the complex is. So K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh right, because K is the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the reactants.

In this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But wait, EDTA itself is usually in a different form because of the pH. Oh wait, the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that the EDTA is fully deprotonated as EDTA^4-? So, the only species we have are the complex and free EDTA and Ca²+.

Wait, but the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial assumption is that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. But wait, actually, K is so large (5e10), which suggests that the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low.

So, let me set up the equation. The formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-

The K for this is 5e10.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the changes.

Initially, the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say the concentration of free Ca²+ is x. Then, the concentration of free EDTA^4- would be y. Because:

The complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So for every mole of complex, you use one mole of each.

Wait, no. Let me think about the initial setup. Suppose we have a solution where the only species are the complex and any dissociated ions. Since the complex dissociates to give Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, but in this case, the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as [Ca²+] = c, and the concentration of free EDTA^4- as [EDTA^4-] = d.

So, according to the
