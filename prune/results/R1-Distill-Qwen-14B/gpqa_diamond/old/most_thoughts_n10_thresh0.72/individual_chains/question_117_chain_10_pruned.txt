Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That causes them to rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So, they must have a chiral center or some sort of stereogenic element.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, so I need to figure out each one individually.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different conformations. Wait, but the substituents are at 6 and 2 positions. So, the biphenyl group has substituents on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. Do these substituents lead to any chirality? Well, the biphenyl itself is symmetric in some cases. Wait, the molecule has two substituents on each ring, but are they arranged in a way that could cause the biphenyl to be chiral?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry. Let's think: the substituents are on positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' are also substituted. So dimethyl ester groups on 2 and 2', and nitro groups on 6 and 6'. Wait, that might make the molecule symmetrical. Because if each ring has the same substituents in equivalent positions, the molecule could be identical upon certain reflections. So would that prevent optical isomerism?

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl can have two enantiomeric forms due to the arrangement of the substituents. Let's think about the biphenyl's structure. If the two rings are attached by a single bond, they can rotate. If the substituents on each ring are such that the arrangement around the central bond can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then that would lead to enantiomers.

So, in this case, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, on each ring, the ester groups are at 2, and nitro at 6. So if the rings
