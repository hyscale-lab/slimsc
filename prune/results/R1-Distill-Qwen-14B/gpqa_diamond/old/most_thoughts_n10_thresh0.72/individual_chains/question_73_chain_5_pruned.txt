Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics because the rules change. So I think I need to use special relativity here.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. Oh, right, their masses are 2m and 3m, but I think in relativity, the rest mass is important. Oh wait, actually, in relativity, the rest mass is the invariant mass, so I guess when we talk about energy, we'll use that.

So the first astronaut has a rest mass of 2m, moving at 0.6c. The second has a rest mass of 3m, moving at 0.5c. Both in the positive x-direction. So I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, the relative speed part: I think you can't just subtract their velocities because they're moving in the same direction. Like, if one is going 0.6c and the other 0.5c, the relative speed isn't just 0.1c. Because of relativity, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2
