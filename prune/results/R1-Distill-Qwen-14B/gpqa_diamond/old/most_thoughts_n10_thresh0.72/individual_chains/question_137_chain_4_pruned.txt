Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what I remember about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

First, I know that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles like protons. The basic idea is that a magnetic field bends the particle's path into a circle, and an electric field accelerates it. The key here is that the frequency of the electric field has to match the particle's rotation frequency as it gains energy, right?

Wait, but wait, synchrocyclotrons are a bit different because they have a varying magnetic field. Oh right, because as the proton gains kinetic energy, its mass increases relativistically, so the magnetic field needs to change to keep the frequency matched. But maybe that's not directly needed for this problem.

The problem says a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0, and it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Hmm, two accelerations? That might mean it goes around twice, but I'm not sure yet.

The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Phi0 is given as π/4, and U0 is 190 kV. So the initial phase is 45 degrees.

Wait, the question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. Revolutions would be related to the time it's in the accelerator and the frequency of the applied voltage.

I remember that in a cyclotron, the number of revolutions is related to the time the particle spends being accelerated. The cyclotron frequency is given by ω = (qB)/(m), but since the magnetic field varies in a synchrocyclotron, maybe that's a bit more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is linked to the number of times the electric field completes a cycle as the proton is accelerated.

The voltage is applied in an alternating manner, so the electric field alternates with frequency ν(α). Wait, but what is ν(α) here? Oh, probably the frequency of the electric field as a function of the particle's momentum or energy. But I'm getting a bit stuck on that.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to find out how much time the proton spends being accelerated and then calculate how many cycles of the electric field occur in that time.

The
