Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let me think. The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, no, wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, right? So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The product is two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. The mass of A times c squared is 300 MeV.

Wait, the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A. I remember that in annihilation reactions, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate that the initial kinetic energy is low, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the initial setup. The proton is probably at rest because the antiproton is moving, but wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, but in the lab frame, maybe the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Or perhaps the initial setup is different. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the frame, but in such problems, often the initial frame is the lab frame where one particle is at rest.

Wait, wait, I think another approach. The initial particles are proton and antiproton. Their rest masses are the same, right? The proton has mass m_p c², and the antiproton does too. But when they annihilate, they produce these A particles.

Wait, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can
