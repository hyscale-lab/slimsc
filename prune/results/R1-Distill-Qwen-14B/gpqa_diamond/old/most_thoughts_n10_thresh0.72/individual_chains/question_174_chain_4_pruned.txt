Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical calculations. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the problem. An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The more massive fragment is twice as heavy as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

The first thing I think I should do is figure out the masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the less massive fragment's rest mass as m, so the more massive one is 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m. According to the problem, this sum is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M. Therefore, m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So the more massive fragment is 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial nucleus has a rest mass of M, but the sum of the fragments is 0.99 M. So there's a mass deficit, which must be converted into kinetic energy and maybe other forms like binding energy. But in this problem, they probably consider that only the rest mass and kinetic energy are relevant.

Now, in a fission process, energy is released, so the kinetic energies of the fragments come from the mass defect. Let me think about the energy involved.

The initial rest energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. The total rest energy after fission is (m + 2m)c² = 3m c² = 0.99 M c². So the energy released is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energy, which is (300 GeV - 0.99 * 300 GeV) = 300 * 0.01 = 3 GeV. So that 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy and any other energies like gamma rays, but I think for this problem, we can assume all of it goes into kinetic energy.

Wait, but actually, in reality, some energy goes into other forms, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so probably all the energy goes into kinetic.

So the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV. Since they move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, their kinetic energies can be found using conservation of energy and momentum.

But wait, the problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So we need to find T1 using relativistic calculations and compare it to the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the rest masses of the two fragments (m and 2m).
2. Calculate the total rest energy after
