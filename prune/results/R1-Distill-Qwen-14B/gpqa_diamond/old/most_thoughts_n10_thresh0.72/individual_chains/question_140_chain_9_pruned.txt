Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, same number of neutrons and protons... that probably means the gas is something like hydrogen (H2), because each hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons total? Or per atom? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule where each atom contributes the same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, let me think. For example, if the molecule is H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So in H2, total protons are 2, total neutrons are 0. Not the same. Hmm. Maybe another gas. What about CO2? No, that's not a gas with the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe it's NH3? Let's see: nitrogen has 7 protons, 7 neutrons (since its atomic mass is about 14). Hydrogen has 1 proton each. So NH3 has 14 (N) + 3 (H) = 17 protons. Neutrons: 7 (from N) + 0 from H = 7. So 17 protons and 7 neutrons. Not the same. So that's not matching.

Wait another thought: maybe the molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons in total. Like, for example, O2. Oxygen has 8 protons each, so O2 has 16 protons. Neutrons per O atom are 8 (since O is about 16, so 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That matches. So the gas W is O2.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule itself has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, H2O: H has 1 p, O has 8 p. So each H contributes 1 p, 0 n. O contributes 8 p, 8 n. So H2O:
