Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which of the given particles isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion. I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a key concept in particle physics and condensed matter.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Phonon: Phonons are quantized sound waves, right? They arise in crystals when the atoms oscillate collectively. I think they come into play due to the breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal lattice. Wait, no, wait. Actually, in a crystal, the translational symmetry is broken because the structure repeats periodically, so the phonon is a result of that broken symmetry. So phonons are related to broken symmetry.

Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons, I believe. They were introduced by Skyrme to model certain particles like pions. Solitons are solutions in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. So Skyrmions are definitely associated with broken symmetry.

Magnon: Magnons are the quasiparticles for spin waves in magnetic materials. When a magnetic material undergoes a phase transition, such as ordering into a ferromagnetic state, the continuous symmetry of the original state is broken. The magnon arises from this symmetry breaking. So yes, magnons are tied to broken symmetry.

Pion: Pions are the lightest mesons, composed of up and down quarks. They are part of the Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. So pions are a direct result of broken symmetry.

Wait, so all options except one are associated with broken symmetry. Which one is the odd one out? Wait, no, the question is which is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Wait, maybe I got one wrong. Let me re-examine.

Phonons are from the breaking of translational symmetry in solids. So yes, that's broken symmetry.

Magnons come from the breaking of rotational symmetry in magnetic materials when they order. Right, like in ferromagnetism, the continuous symmetry is broken, so magnons are Goldstone bosons there.

Skyrmions are a solution in theories where symmetry is broken, so they come from that.

Pions are Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking, so yes.

Wait, so all of them are associated with broken symmetry. But the question says which is NOT. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait another angle: Are any of these entities not particles that emerge from symmetry breaking?

Wait, maybe the phonon is different. Because in the case of crystals, the lattice breaks translational symmetry. The phonon is a boson resulting from this. So yes, it's a Goldstone mode for the broken translational symmetry.

Wait, but Goldstone's theorem says that for every continuous symmetry broken, you get a massless boson. But in solids, the phonon has a gap, so maybe that's not exactly the same as a Goldstone mode? Or is it because the symmetry is discrete?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about it: the original symmetry in a solid
