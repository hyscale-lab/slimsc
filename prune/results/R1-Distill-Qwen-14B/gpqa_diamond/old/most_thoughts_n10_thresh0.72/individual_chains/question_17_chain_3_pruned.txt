Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, each with different concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and when it does, it can significantly affect the concentration of the free metal ions in solution. The K here is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that means the concentration of the complex (CaY^2-, where Y is EDTA) is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates, but the K is so large, the amount of free Ca²+ ions should be really low.

So, the reaction is probably Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. The K is given as 5e10, which is a huge number. So the complex is almost completely formed, meaning very little free Ca²+ in solution.

But wait, in this scenario, are we assuming that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex? Well, not exactly, because the K is just a very large number, but not infinite. So, some Ca²+ will dissociate, but it's a small amount.

The formula for K is [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Since the solution is stoichiometric, meaning the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- were in a 1:1 ratio, right? But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation.

So, the complex dissociates as CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. Let's call the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates as x. Then, the concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So, K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, wait, that makes sense. So substituting, 0.02/(x²) = 5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Let me compute that.
