Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's break down what's going on here.

The setup is that the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They've introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they checked the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct, and I need to find out why.

Looking at the options, let's consider each possibility.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, the HA tag is a short peptide, maybe 10 amino acids. If there's a missense, the tag might not be recognized by antibodies. But wait, the problem is overexpression, not detection. If the tag is messed up, it might affect purification but not necessarily expression levels. Plus, the issue here is that the construct isn't expressing the protein, not that it's not being detected. So maybe A isn't the main issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. Ribosomes stop at stop codons. If the coding sequence has a premature stop codon, the protein would be truncated. But in the given sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons. Let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets. Looking through the sequence, I see a lot of codons, but I'll scan for those. Hmm, the end of the sequence is TGA at the end, but wait, the sequence is the plus strand's coding sequence. Let me check the end. The last part is ...GGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. Wait, the TGA is right before the end. Let me see: ...TGA... No, wait, the last part is ...GAGTGA. Oh, wait, the last three codons would be GAG, TGA. So TGA is a stop codon. So the construct ends with TGA, which is a stop. That's normal, so the ribosome should terminate there. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, maybe the construct has a stop codon earlier. Let me check earlier in the sequence. Let's see, the start is ATG (which is methionine, the start codon). Then the HA tag would be the next few codons. Let me parse the sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGG AAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCG GCC AGG CTG CCA CTC ACC GCG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC CTC ACG CCG CGC GTG GAC CCG ACA CTT CTA GCT GCT GCG GCG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA TT... and so on.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any in-frame TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end. Let's go through the sequence in triplets.

Looking through:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGG AAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCG GCC AGG CTG CCA CTC ACC GCG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC CTC ACG CCG CGC GTG GAC CCG ACA CTT CTA GCT GCT GCG GCG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT A GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CCG GGG TTA GGA AGG ATC CCG CCT TGG AGA AGC TCA GCC TGT TTT GCG AGA AGA GCC GCA GCG TAA CGA TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC TCT CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, I see 'TAA CGA TGG', so the TAA is the 20th codon in the second half. So TAA is a stop codon. So in the middle, there's a TAA which would cause the ribosome to stop early. So the construct would produce a truncated protein because of this premature stop codon.

So the problem is that the coding sequence has an in-frame TAA stop codon, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a shorter protein that might not function, and the overexpression wouldn't happen because the gene is not properly expressed.

So looking at the options, option B is "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would explain the lack of overexpression because the protein isn't being made in its full length.

But wait, why is there a TAA in the middle? Did the researcher make a mistake in the construct? Maybe during cloning, an unintended stop codon was introduced. That would prevent full-length protein expression.

So the correct answer would be option
