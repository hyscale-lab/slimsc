Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. Let me think, the main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, pp-III is also called the CNO cycle or something like that. Wait, no, the CNO cycle is a separate process involving carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Oh wait, no, maybe the CNO cycle is part of the pp-III branch? Or is pp-III a different thing? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4. Then pp-II and pp-III are sort of side reactions, maybe involving higher metallicity or different paths. Oh wait, I think the main pp chain produces about 99% of the Sun's energy, and the other branches are minor. But the question is about the pp-III branch stopping.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, which is the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So the neutrinos we detect now would have been emitted before the pp-III stopped, right? Or wait, the neutrinos are produced in the core, so if the pp-III branch stopped, the neutrinos would stop being produced from that branch, but the others are still going.

Wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need to find the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2).

I remember that the dominant neutrino emission from the Sun comes from the pp chain. Specifically, the main process is the pp-I branch, which produces a lot of neutrinos. The pp-III branch produces fewer, but maybe at higher energies? Or lower?

Wait, neutrinos are produced in several processes. The main ones are the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, which produces high-energy neutrinos, and the dominant ppI which produces lower energy neutrinos, and ppII and ppIII which might contribute more in the middle energies.

Wait, when the Sun's core
