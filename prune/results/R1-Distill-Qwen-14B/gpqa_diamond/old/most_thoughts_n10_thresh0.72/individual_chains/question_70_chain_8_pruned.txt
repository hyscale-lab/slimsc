Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a series of reactions, and we're supposed to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, so first, I need to figure out what's happening in each reaction. Let me read through each part carefully.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8B → C. I'm thinking maybe A is a metal? Because when metals react with something, especially in stoichiometric amounts, like 8 equivalents, perhaps it's something like aluminum reacting with a halogen, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, bright red product. Hmm, what compounds are bright red? Maybe something like sulfur, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal oxide. Or perhaps a transition metal compound. Bright red could be a clue—maybe like iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not certain.

Next reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. E is dangerous, so maybe something like a nerve agent or a toxic gas? Wait, but I'm not sure; maybe it's a more common dangerous compound. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene or another hazardous chemical. But let's hold that thought.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is added to water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Since F is strong and G weak, possible that C is a sulfide or something that forms strong and weak acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids are like acetic acid, H3PO4 (but wait, that's actually a moderately strong acid... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe F is sulfuric acid and G is something like H2S? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, if C is something like SO2, then when it reacts with water, it forms H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and perhaps some other product. But wait, maybe I should think more about the first reaction.

Wait, I also have the fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H, and H is a solvent. What solvents are the result of reactions between gases? For example, H2O is a solvent, but that would require D and B to be H2 and O2, but they wouldn't combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O because that would require H2 + 0.5 O2 → H2O. Wait, no, but perhaps another solvent. Maybe D and B are something else.

Wait, another thought:
