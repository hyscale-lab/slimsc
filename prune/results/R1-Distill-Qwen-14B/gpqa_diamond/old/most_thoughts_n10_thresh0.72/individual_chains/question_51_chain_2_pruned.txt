Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done to bring charges together, so maybe I should think about the interactions between the charges.

The setup is: a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. The sphere is grounded, which probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge would go to the ground. That might affect how the charges are distributed on the sphere.

Wait, when you have a grounded conducting sphere and you bring a charge near it, the sphere induces charges on its surface. Since the sphere is conductor, the charges will redistribute until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But because it's grounded, any induced charges can flow away. So when a positive charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's near side would have an induced negative charge, and the far side would have positive? Or wait, no, actually, since it's grounded, the sphere can lose or gain electrons. Let me think. If the sphere is neutral to start with and you bring a positive charge near it, the induced charges would be negative on the side closer to q, but since the sphere is grounded, this negative charge would flow away, leaving the sphere with an overall negative charge? Or no, wait, maybe not. Because a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium allows charges to move freely, so if the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charge would leave until the potential on the sphere is the same as the ground's potential, which is zero (assuming ground is at zero potential). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: When a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But because it's grounded, the induced charges can leave the sphere, so the sphere's potential is zero. So the charge on the sphere would be such that the potential on its surface is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the charge on the sphere is such that the potential due to the external charge q and the induced charge on the sphere equals zero on the sphere's surface. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that the method of images could be useful
