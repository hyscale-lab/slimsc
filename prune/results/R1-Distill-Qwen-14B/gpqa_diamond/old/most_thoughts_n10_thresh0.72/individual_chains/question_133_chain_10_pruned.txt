Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate.

The question is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO₄³- or PO₄³- (I think they're the same but maybe different forms?), in the solution. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so activity coefficients might be neglected or assumed to be 1.

The problem gives the three dissociation constants for H₃PO₄: Ka1 =7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. So, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons, each with its own Ka value.

First, I think I need to figure out how much each of the salts contributes to the phosphate ions in solution. Both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are phosphate salts, so they'll dissociate in water.

Let me write down the dissociations:

1. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-:
   KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-

2. Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-:
   Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- (the water part just adds mass but doesn't affect ions in solution)

Wait, but Na2HPO4 is the disodium hydrogen phosphate, which is Na2HPO4, so yes, that's correct. So, each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Now, the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or is it H2PO4^-? Hmm, I need to clarify that. Wait, no. The orthophosphate ion is usually HPO4^3- but wait, sometimes people refer to H2PO4^- as the dihydrogen phosphate, and HPO4^2- as hydrogen phosphate. So, perhaps the orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, HPO4^3-, but I'm not so sure. Let me think.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. For H3PO4, the first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orth
