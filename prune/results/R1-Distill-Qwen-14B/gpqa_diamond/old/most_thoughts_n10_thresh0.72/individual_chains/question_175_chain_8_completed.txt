Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ (with the z-axis). The maximum power is A, and they're asking what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a λ dependence.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the type of dipole. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is given by something like the dipole radiation formula.

The power radiated in a particular direction is related to the radiation pattern. For a dipole, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Because of the sin squared term, the maximum intensity occurs when sinθ is 1, which is θ=90 degrees. But wait, the question is about θ=30 degrees. Oh, wait no, the maximum power is given as A, which would be at θ=90 degrees for a dipole.

Wait, let me think again. The dipole radiation pattern in the far field is I think proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum occurs at θ=90°, where sinθ is 1. At θ=0°, it's zero. So if I want the fraction f at θ=30°, I need to compute the value of the intensity there and see what fraction it is of the maximum.

So the function f(θ) would be proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum intensity is when sinθ is 1, so f_max = sin²90 =1. At θ=30°, sin30 is 0.5, so sin²30 is 0.25. So the intensity at 30° is 0.25 times the maximum. So the fraction of A (the maximum) is 0.25, which is 1/4.

Wait, but the question says the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ. So perhaps I'm ignoring any λ dependence. What's the dependence of the power on λ?

Hmm, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole also depends on the frequency. For a dipole, the power radiated is proportional to (acceleration)^2, and acceleration is related to the angular frequency squared. So maybe the power is proportional to ω^4, but wait, ω is 2πf, and f is 1/λ * c, since speed of light c = λ f. So f = c/(λ). So ω = 2π c / λ.

So the power would be something like (1/λ^4), because ω^4 would give (1/λ^4) multiplied by some constants. Because ω^4 is (2π c / λ)^4, which is proportional to 1/λ^4. So the function f would depend on 1/λ^4. So f is proportional to 1/λ^4.

Looking at the options, the fraction is 1/4 and the λ dependence is λ^-4. Looking at the options, option C says 1/4 and λ^-4. So the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to λ^-4.

Wait, let me make sure. The radiation from a dipole is indeed proportional to sin^2θ, which at 30 degrees gives (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So that gives the fraction of A as 1/4. As for the λ dependence, the total power radiated by a dipole is proportional to (q a)^2, where a is acceleration. The acceleration is the second derivative of position, which for a simple harmonic oscillator is proportional to ω². So a ~ q ω². So power is proportional to (q a)^2 = q² (q ω²)^2 = q^4 ω^4. And ω is 2π c / λ. So ω^4 is proportional to 1/λ^4. So the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle, would have a factor of 1/λ^4. So the function f is proportional to 1/λ^4, and the fraction at 30 degrees is 1/4. So the correct option would be C.


To analyze the problem, we consider the radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroidal with its symmetry along the z-axis. The power radiated per unit solid angle in the far field is proportional to a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( \theta \) is the angle with respect to the z-axis. For a dipole radiator, the intensity pattern is given by \( f(\theta) \propto \sin^2\theta \). 

1. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \):**  
   The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin 30^\circ = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2 30^\circ = 0.25 \). This means the intensity at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 0.25 \) times the maximum intensity. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

2. **Dependence of \( f \) on \( \lambda \):**  
   The total power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. Since \( \omega = 2\pi c / \lambda \), we have \( \omega^4 \propto 1/\lambda^4 \). Thus, the function \( f \) depends on \( \lambda \) as \( \lambda^{-4} \).

3. **Correct Option:**  
   Combining these results, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the function \( f \) has a \( \lambda^{-4} \) dependence. This matches option C.
