Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ · n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the unit vector n. And ε is an energy constant.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2.

Now, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, for any 2x2 matrix, especially one that's a spin operator multiplied by a constant, perhaps there's a shortcut.

I remember that for a spin-½ particle, the eigenvalues of the spin component in a particular direction are ± ħ/2. But wait, the Pauli matrices don't have the ħ factor. Because Pauli matrices themselves are 2x2 matrices with elements ±1 or 0. So perhaps the Hamiltonian here is proportional to the Pauli vector.

Wait, the general form for
