Okay, so I have this question about which stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) should be at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. 

First, I need to understand what factors determine whether a star is detectable. I remember that the S/N ratio depends on factors like the star's brightness, the telescope's collecting area, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. 

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, right? So it's designed for studying the spectra of stars in great detail. But for a star to be detected, it must be bright enough. Absolute magnitude probably plays a big role here because it tells us the intrinsic brightness of the star.

Looking at the options, the stars are either Canopus, Polaris, or have the same absolute magnitude (V=15 mag) but different distances. So for the a and b options, I need to figure out their apparent magnitudes as seen from Earth because apparent magnitude is what determines how bright a star appears to us.

Let me think: the formula for calculating apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. Oh wait, the formula is actually m - M = 5 log10(d) - 5. So m = M +5(log10(d) -1).

Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its absolute magnitude is around -5.7 I believe. Wait, I might be mixing up the numbers. Alternatively, I can look up its approximate apparent magnitude. Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky, so its apparent magnitude is about -0.7 or so. Polaris, on the other hand, is much fainter. I think its apparent magnitude is around 1.8 to 2.0, maybe a bit higher. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Polaris is the North Star, and I remember it's not extremely bright. Its apparent magnitude is about 2.0. So Canopus is much brighter than Polaris.

Wait, but in the options a and b, they are Canopus and Polaris. So their apparent magnitudes are much lower (brighter) than the other options. Let me think: the other options (c to f) all have the same absolute magnitude of 15, but varying distances.

Wait, absolute magnitude is 15 mag, which is quite faint. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of about 4.8. So a star with absolute magnitude 15 is much fainter than the Sun. So for example, let's compute their apparent magnitudes:

Option c: distance 10 pc. So m = 15 +5*(log10(10) -1) = 15 +5*(1-1)=15. So apparent magnitude is 15. That's very faint.

Option e: distance 5 pc. m =15 +5*(log10(5) -1). log10(5) is about
