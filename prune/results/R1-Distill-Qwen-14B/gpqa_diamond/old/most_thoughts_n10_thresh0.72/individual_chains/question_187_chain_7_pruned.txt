Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on signal-to-noise ratio. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets and studying the universe's expansion. But the main point here is determining when a star is detectable based on S/N.

The question says a star is detectable if it has a S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out for each of the options a to f, whether their S/N meets or exceeds 10.

Wait, but how does S/N depend on the star's properties? I think it depends mainly on the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) because higher brightness (lower magnitude) means more photons, which leads to higher S/N. But how exactly?

I recall that S/N generally scales with the square root of the signal. For a spectrograph, the signal is proportional to the number of photons detected. The signal is determined by the star's flux and the exposure time. The noise is usually the Poisson noise, which is proportional to the square root of the signal. 

So S/N = (signal) / noise = sqrt(signal) / sqrt(noise) = sqrt(signal/noise^2) â€“ wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula. S/N is proportional to (exposure time) * (flux)^(1/2). But wait, the exact formula might be more involved because it also depends on the system's efficiency and the star's spectrum.

Alternatively, I remember that for a given telescope and instrument setup, the S/N for a star depends on its apparent magnitude. The formula is something like S/N = k * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m is the apparent magnitude, m0 is a reference magnitude, t is the exposure time, and k is a constant that includes the instrument's efficiency and photon flux.

But I'm not exactly sure about the numbers. I think ESPRESSO has a certain S/N per pixel capability at a certain magnitude. Maybe I should look up the ESPRESSO's typical performance. Wait, but I can't access external links, so I'll have to recall.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but its sensitivity depends on the star's brightness. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is capable of achieving high S/N for bright stars, but for very faint stars, it might not reach the required S/N even with a long exposure.

So each option gives the star's absolute magnitude (Mv) and distance. I need to calculate their apparent magnitude (mv) to determine how bright they appear from Earth. Absolute magnitude is how bright they would appear at 10 pc. So the formula for apparent magnitude is mv = Mv + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me go through each option:

a) Canopus: Canopus is a bright star. I
