Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. So, this term involves the field strength tensor F, which is related to the electromagnetic field, I think. 

Wait, the problem is about the mass dimension of κ. Oh right, in quantum field theory, the mass dimension is important for determining renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimensions that are non-negative. If any coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable because it would require an infinite number of counterterms, making it a non-renormalizable interaction.

But wait, how do I find the mass dimension of κ? I remember that each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension equal to 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (since the action is integrated over four spacetime dimensions, each with dimension 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have [L] = 4.

Looking at the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's figure out the dimensions of each component.

First, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, the Dirac spinor has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would also have dimension 3/2. 

Then σ_{μν} is built from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ itself is dimensionless. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

What about F^{μν}? That's the field strength tensor. The electromagnetic field tensor F is derived from the vector potential A, which has mass dimension 1. The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative brings a dimension of 1. So F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) which is dimension 3, and F which is dimension 2. So the entire term's dimension is [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So κ has a mass dimension of -1. 

Now, is the theory renormalizable? For a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have mass dimension ≥0. Because each loop in a Feynman diagram brings in a factor of momentum to some power, but with a dimensionless coupling, the theory can be renormalized with a finite number of counterterms. If a coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction becomes relevant (or irrelevant, depending on sign) and the theory isn't renormalizable because you'd need an infinite number of counterterms.

In this case, [κ] = -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable. Because when you have a coupling with negative mass dimension, the interaction term is of higher dimension than 4, making it non-renormalizable. 

So looking at the options: The first part is [κ]=-1. The second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. So the options with [κ]=-1 are options A and C. The theory not being renormalizable would be option C. So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In quantum field theory, the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. Each term in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must also have mass dimension 4.

- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, which are dimensionless. Thus, $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ is derived from the vector potential $A_\mu$, which has mass dimension 1. Since $F^{\mu\nu} \sim \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$, $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.

The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension:
\[
\text{Dimension of } \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
The term $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2. Therefore, the entire term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension:
\[
[\kappa] + 3 + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, we solve:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension than 4, making the theory non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, unlike renormalizable theories.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** Incorrect: While $[\kappa] = -1$, the theory is not renormalizable.
- **B)** Incorrect: $[\kappa] \neq 1$.
- **C)** Correct: $[\kappa] = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **D)** Incorrect: $[\kappa] \neq 1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
