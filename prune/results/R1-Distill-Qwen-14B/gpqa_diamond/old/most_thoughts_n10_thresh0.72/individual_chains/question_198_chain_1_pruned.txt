Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with complex ions and stability constants, it's all about the formation of different complexes and their concentrations.

So, the problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands attached, right? So higher β means more stable the complex. But here, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the complexes form in a certain order, and β4 is for a different structure?

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n+) ion. Dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands attached. So I'm looking for the fraction of Co in the form of the complex with two SCN- ions.

I remember that the formation of complexes follows a stepwise process, and the stability constants are cumulative. Each β represents the formation of a complex with n ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4−? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the charges wrong. Let me think: Co(II) is Co^2+. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) ?

Wait, no. Wait, each SCN- is -1, so for n SCN-, the charge would be 2+ - n*(-1) = 2-n. So:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^(+1) → because 2+ - (-1) → +1
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → 2+ - 2*(-1) = 2+ +2 → 4+? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, each SCN- is -1. So for each SCN, you add -1. So starting with Co^2+:

n=1: Co(SCN) → 2+ plus (1*-1) → 1+ charge.
n=2: Co(SCN)_2 → 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0 charge.
n=3: Co(SCN)_3 → 2+ +3*(-1)= -1 charge.
n=4: Co(SCN)_4 → 2+ +4*(-1)= -2 charge.

Oh, right! So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the stepwise formation constant. So for example, β1 is the constant for the first ligand binding: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+; β1=9.

β2 is for adding the second ligand: [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0; β2=40.

Similarly, β3 is for adding the third: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^−; β3=63.

And β4 is for the fourth ligand: [Co(SCN)_3]^− + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^2−; β4=16.

Wait, but wait—usually, the stability constants are cumulative. Or are they stepwise? Oh, I think they're stepwise. So β1 is the first step, β2 the second, etc. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) would be the product of β1*β2*...*βn.

So for the complex with two ligands, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the formation constant K is β1 * β2. Let me compute that. 9 * 40 = 360.

Wait, but I'm not sure if β4 is lower than β3. 16 is less than 63. So the fourth ligand binds less strongly. So the tendency is to form more of the complexes with lower n beyond a
