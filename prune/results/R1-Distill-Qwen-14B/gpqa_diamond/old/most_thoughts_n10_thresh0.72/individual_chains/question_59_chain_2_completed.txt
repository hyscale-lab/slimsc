Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But since there are three different solutions here, I need to figure out what's going on when all three are combined. I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base, then see how they react.

Let me list out the components:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But maybe I can handle that after considering the neutralization.

2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, releasing H+ ions.

3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely, providing OH- ions.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions per formula unit. So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So, the plan is to calculate moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2, then see if they neutralize each other. The excess will determine the pH, whether it's acidic or basic.

Let me compute the moles for each.

For CH3COOH:
Volume = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't contribute much H+ on its own right now. But when mixed with strong base, maybe it will react.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles. HCl is strong acid, so all moles contribute H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when we mix all these, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. Also, the CH3COOH might react with the OH- if there's any excess.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about neutralization. The OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, because HCl is a stronger acid than CH3COOH. Once the H+ from HCl is all neutralized, any remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH, but since CH3COOH is a weak acid, it can only donate H+ up to a point.

So first, let's calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ available: from HCl is 0.08 moles. CH3COOH contributes some, but since it's weak, maybe we can consider it as part of the solution after considering the neutralization.

Total OH- available: from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

So, OH- will react with H+ from HCl.

H+ (0.08 moles) + OH- (0.08 moles) → 0.08 H2O. So, that will neutralize completely. Now, how much OH- is left? 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

Now, this excess OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, it can donate H+ ions. So the reaction will be:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

How much CH3COOH do we have? 0.05 moles.

We have 0.10 moles of OH- available. So, OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, because that's all that's available.

So after reaction, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized to form acetate ions (CH3COO^-), and the remaining OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18, which first neutralizes HCl's 0.08 H+. Then, the remaining 0.10 OH- has to react with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, so it can neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-. So after that, OH- left is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait another thing. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is in a solution that's 300 mL, but when mixed with the other solutions, the total volume increases. So I need to calculate the total volume of the mixture to find the concentration of OH- or H+ after neutralization.

Let me compute the total volume first.

500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL → 1.2 L.

So, after all reactions, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH- left. Because:

HCl's H+ (0.08) neutralizes part of OH- (0.08), leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, CH3COOH (0.05 moles) neutralizes 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, total OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

Now, the OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

Wait, but wait! Wait a second. Let me think again. Because the OH- comes from a strong base, and the CH3COOH is a weak acid. So when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it's a neutralization reaction producing acetate and water.

So after that, the solution contains excess OH- of 0.05 moles, which is in 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041667 M.

Then, to find pH, I can first find pOH and then pH.

pOH = -log [OH-] = -log (0.041667) ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. log(0.041667) is log(4.1667e-2) → log(4.1667) is about 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381. So pOH = 1.381.

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.381 = 12.619, approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So the answer should be A.

But wait, I want to double-check. Could I have made a mistake in the neutralization steps?

Let me recount the steps:

1. Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L *0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-: 0.08 vs 0.18. H+ is all consumed, OH- left is 0.10.

4. Remaining OH- (0.10 moles) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). So all CH3COOH is used, OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05.

So yeah, OH- is 0.05 in 1.2 L. So [OH-] is about 0.041667 M.

pOH is about 1.38, pH is 12.62. So option A is correct.

I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The presence of a weak acid after strong base might have other considerations, but in this case, it's completely neutralized by the excess OH-, so the remaining solution is basic, determined by the excess OH-.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solution contains:

1. **CH3COOH (0.05 moles)**: A weak acid that does not fully dissociate on its own.
2. **HCl (0.08 moles)**: A strong acid that fully dissociates, contributing 0.08 moles of H+ ions.
3. **Ba(OH)2 (0.18 moles of OH-)**: A strong base that fully dissociates, contributing 0.18 moles of OH- ions.

### Step 1: Neutralization of H+ and OH-
- The 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl neutralize 0.08 moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.10 moles of OH- unreacted.

### Step 2: Reaction of Remaining OH- with CH3COOH
- The remaining 0.10 moles of OH- react with the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. This neutralizes all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH- unreacted.

### Step 3: Calculate [OH-] in the Final Solution
- The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
- The concentration of OH- is:
  \[
  [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate pOH and pH
- The pOH is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
  \]
- The pH is then:
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
  \]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.
