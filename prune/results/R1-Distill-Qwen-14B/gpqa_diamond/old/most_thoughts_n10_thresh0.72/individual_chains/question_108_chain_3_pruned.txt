Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, the question is about the magnetic field being parallel to the Oz axis. So, I remember that in atoms, the magnetic field interactions are related to the orbital and spin magnetic moments. Oh right, the Zeeman effect comes into play when there's an external magnetic field. But wait, the problem mentions the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism usually involves the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and an external field. For hydrogen, since it's a single electron, I think the orbital part (m) comes into play.

Wait, the problem states that m has small values. Oh, right, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The possible values for m are -l to +l in integer steps. But the problem says small m, so maybe m is zero or a small integer. Hmm, but how does that affect the coupling?

The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla. That's a pretty strong field, but I'm not sure how that compares to typical atomic scales. I recall that in atoms, the magnetic interactions are usually much smaller than the energy levels from electric interactions. But wait, this is a paramagnetic term, which is a correction to the energy levels.

The question asks to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE. The transition is given with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, that's the Balmer series in hydrogen, the H-alpha line I think. So the energy ΔE corresponds to that transition.

Let me calculate ΔE first. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². For the Balmer series, the transition is from n=3 to n=2. So E_3 = -13.6 / 9 ≈ -1.511 eV and E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. The energy difference ΔE is E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. Wait, but since energy differences are positive, ΔE is about 1.8
