Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that's probably a typo on my part; the correct expression should involve the coupling. But I think the key here is to understand how the boson X interacts with fermions. Oh right, the general form for such an interaction is something like L ~ g X ψ† ψ, where g is the coupling constant and ψ is the fermion field.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find which fermions it can decay into at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed decays depend on the mass of the boson and the rest mass of the fermions. So, for a decay X → f f̄ to be possible, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f, right? Because you need enough energy to create two particles each with mass m_f. So X's mass should be ≥ 2m_f.

But wait, the question is about the lowest order decays. So I guess we're looking for tree-level decays, not higher-order processes. That probably means the decay must be possible via a single vertex, so the interaction must directly couple X to the fermion pair.

Looking at the options, each option lists different possible fermion pairs. Let me list out the possible fermions and their masses. I think I remember the masses of the quarks and leptons.

The known fermion masses (approximate):

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV (maybe around 95-105 MeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV (around 1.25 to 1.5 GeV)
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV (4.1 to 4.7 GeV)
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

So, X has a mass of 6 GeV. So for each fermion pair, I need to check 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's check each fermion:

- e: 2*0.5 MeV = 1 MeV → yes
- μ: 2*0.105 GeV ≈ 0.21 GeV → yes
- τ: 2*1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV → yes
- u: 2*2 MeV = 4 MeV → yes
- d: 2*5 MeV = 10 MeV → yes
- s: 2*0.1 GeV = 0.2 GeV → yes
- c: 2*1.5 GeV = 3 GeV → yes
- b: 2*4.5 GeV =9 GeV → X is 6 GeV <9, so can't decay into b b̄
- t: way too heavy, 2*173=346 GeV, so no.

So the possible fermions where 2m_f ≤6 GeV are:

e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: X → b, s, u, d, tau, e. Wait, but b's 2m is 9 GeV, which is more than X
