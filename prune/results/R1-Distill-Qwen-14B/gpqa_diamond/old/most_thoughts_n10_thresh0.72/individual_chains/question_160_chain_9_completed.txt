Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, the setup is an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ, traveling along the z-axis, shines vertically onto this aperture. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field region when N is infinitely large. Also, we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, so first, I remember that when dealing with diffraction, the pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, we have the minima at certain angles, but here the aperture is polygon-shaped. But when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, but wait. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'? Because in a circle, the apothem is the radius. So the aperture becomes a circular one with radius a.

Wait, no. Wait. For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the radius of the circumscribed circle (the distance from center to a vertex) is longer than the apothem. But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, but the radius would be related to the apothem. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the relation between the apothem and the radius for a polygon.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem states that all apothems are the same length 'a'. So for a regular polygon, each side has the same apothem. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'. Or wait, no, because the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, which for a circle is the same in all directions. So the radius of the circle would actually be the apothem 'a' because the apothem in a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the side, which in a circle is just the radius. So yes, the radius R is equal to 'a'.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius is the distance from the center to a vertex. So for a regular polygon with n sides, the radius R is related to the apothem a by R = a / cos(π/n). As n approaches infinity, cos(π/n) approaches cos(0) which is 1. So R approaches a. So for infinitely large N, the radius is a. So the aperture becomes a circle of radius a.

So the problem reduces to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture when N is very large. Because the question is about the minima, which occurs when the path difference leads to destructive interference.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the single-slit diffraction pattern is different. Wait no, I'm mixing things up. The single-slit diffraction is for a slit, which is a rectangle, but a circular aperture has a different diffraction pattern, the Airy disk. The minima in the Airy disk are given by the zeros of the Bessel functions.

But wait, the question says the apertures are polygons, but when N is infinitely large, it's a circle. So perhaps the problem is actually using the single-slit formula, but that doesn't quite make sense because a circle has a more complex diffraction pattern.

Wait, the options given are in terms of lambda over a, which reminds me of the single-slit minima formula, which is a sin(theta) = m lambda, where m is an integer. But for a single slit of width 'd', the minima occur at theta = m lambda / d.

Wait, but in this problem, the apertures are polygons. So perhaps for each side, the width is a certain length, and when N is large, it's like a circular aperture but with many slits, but no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the polygon as a collection of rectangular slits or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fourier transform problem, where the diffraction pattern is the Fourier transform of the aperture.

Wait, but another approach: if the polygon is regular and has the same apothem for all sides, then for each side, the width is related to the apothem and the number of sides. The length of each side can be calculated using the formula for a regular polygon. The apothem a is related to the side length s and the number of sides N. The formula for the side length s is 2 * a * tan(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s ≈ 2a*(π/N) → 0 as N becomes large. So each side becomes infinitesimally small, but the overall shape becomes a circle.

Wait, but the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So for a single slit, the first minima is at theta = lambda/(a) for m=1. But wait, the single-slit formula is a sin(theta) = m lambda. So for the first minimum (m=1), sin(theta) = lambda/a, so theta ≈ lambda/a (since theta is small, sin(theta) ≈ theta).

But wait, in the single-slit case, the minima are at theta = m lambda / d, where d is the slit width. So if each side of the polygon is a slit of width s, perhaps the problem is considering each side as a slit, and the diffraction pattern is a result of multiple slits? But no, because the question refers to the overall diffraction pattern from the entire aperture, which is a polygon.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Since N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture (Fraunhofer diffraction) has a central bright spot surrounded by concentric rings. The minima occur where the Bessel function J1 is zero.

Wait, the first minima in the Airy disk occur at θ where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J1 are at approximately 3.832, 7.016, etc. The first zero is at about 3.832. So, the condition is k a sinθ = 3.832, where k is 2π/λ.

So, sinθ = (3.832 λ)/(2 π a). Since theta is small, sinθ ≈ theta, so theta ≈ (3.832 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ (3.832)/(6.283) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.609 * (λ/a).

Wait, 3.832 divided by 2π is approximately 3.832 / 6.283 ≈ 0.609. So theta ≈ 0.609 λ / a.

But looking at the options, option A is 0.610 λ/a. That seems to match. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, the first minimum is at 0.609 lambda/a, but the second minimum is at 1.220 lambda/a (since the next zero of J1 is 7.016, so 7.016/(2 pi)≈1.116, but wait:

Wait, the zeros of J1 are at approximately 3.832, 7.016, 10.173, etc. So the first zero is 3.832: theta1= (3.832 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ 0.609 (λ/a), the second zero is 7.016, but wait, wait, no: the zeros are for J1(k a sinθ)=0. So the first minimum is at 3.832, the second at 7.016, the third at 10.173, etc.

Wait, but the first two minima would be the first two zeros. So the angular separation between the first and second minima is (7.016 -3.832) * (lambda)/(2 pi a) ≈ (3.184) * (lambda)/(2 pi a) ≈ 3.184/(6.283)≈0.506. So the angular distance would be 0.506 lambda/a.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at 3.832, second at 7.016, so the difference is 3.184. So angular difference would be 3.184 * lambda/(2 pi a). Let me compute that:

3.184/(2 pi) = 3.184/(6.283) ≈ 0.506. So the angular separation is approximately 0.506 lambda/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 lambda/a. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle. The first minimum is at theta1 ≈ 1.22 lambda/(pi a) because for single-slit, it's lambda/(a), but wait no, single-slit is for a slit of width d. The formula is a sin(theta) = m lambda, where a is the slit width. So for a circular aperture, the minima are at (pi a sin theta)/lambda = j_{n,p} where j is the p-th zero of the Bessel function Jn. The first minima for the zeroth order is at j_{1,1} = 3.8317.

Wait, let me correct that. The condition for the minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction of a circular aperture is that the argument of the Bessel function J1 is equal to its zeros. The condition is (pi a sin theta)/lambda = j_{1,m}, where j_{1,m} is the m-th zero of J1. The first zero is j_{1,1}=3.8317, the second j_{1,2}=7.0156.

So the angular positions are:

theta_1 = (j_{1,1} lambda)/(pi a) ≈ (3.8317 lambda)/(pi a) ≈ (3.8317)/(3.1416) * (lambda/a) ≈ 1.220 * (lambda/a).

Wait, hold on, because 3.8317 / 3.1416 is about 1.220. So theta_1 ≈ 1.220 lambda/(a). Similarly, theta_2 is at j_{1,2}=7.0156. So theta_2 ≈ 7.0156/(pi) * (lambda /a) ≈ 2.233 (lambda/a).

Wait, wait a second, that can't be right because 7.0156 divided by pi is approximately 2.233, so theta_2 is about 2.233 lambda/a. Then the angular distance between theta_1 and theta_2 would be 2.233 - 1.220 = 1.013 lambda/a. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's re-examine the formula. The condition for the minima is (pi a sin theta)/lambda = j_{m,p}, where j_{m,p} is the p-th zero of J_m. For the first minimum (the smallest), the dominant term is J_1, so m=1, p=1. So the first minimum occurs at (pi a sin theta)/lambda = j_{1,1} ≈ 3.8317. So sin theta = (3.8317 lambda)/(pi a).

But when the angle is small, sin theta ≈ theta. Thus, theta ≈ (3.8317 lambda)/(pi a) ≈ (3.8317)/(3.1416) * (lambda/a) ≈ 1.220 (lambda/a). So the first minimum is at about 1.220 λ/a.

The next minimum is the next zero of J_1. The second zero is j_{1,2}=7.0156. So sin theta = (7.0156 lambda)/(pi a), and theta ≈ (7.0156)/(pi) lambda/a ≈ 2.233 (lambda/a).

Wait, but 2.233 is larger than the first minimum, so the angular distance between the first and second minima is 2.233 - 1.220 = 1.013 lambda/a. But none of the options match that. The options are all much smaller, like 0.506.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong zeros. Because in the Fraunhofer diffraction of a circular aperture, the first minimum is at theta ≈ 1.22 lambda/(pi a), but wait, no: 3.8317 is about 1.22 pi. Because 3.8317 ≈ 1.22 * 3.1416 ≈ 3.83. Exactly. So (3.8317)/(pi) ≈ 1.22. So theta_1 is 1.22 lambda/(a), but wait, no: because (pi a sin theta) = j_{1,1} lambda. So sin theta = (j_{1,1}/pi) (lambda/a), which for j_{1,1} ≈3.8317, is about (3.8317/3.1416) (lambda/a) ≈ 1.22 (lambda/a).

Wait, but this can't be since sin theta can't exceed 1. So, perhaps the condition is (pi a sin theta)/lambda = j_{1,1}, so sin theta = (j_{1,1}/pi) (lambda/a). So, if a is the apothem, which is the radius for a large N, then the argument is (pi a sin theta)/lambda = j_{1,1}.

Wait, let me correct this. The formula for the minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction of a circular aperture is:

sin(theta) = (lambda * j_{m,p})/(pi * a)

where j_{m,p} is the p-th zero of the Bessel function J_m.

Wait, but wait—this is getting confusing, perhaps I should look up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the single-slit diffraction formula.

Wait, but the problem states that when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be that of a circular aperture, which is the Airy disk.

In the Airy disk, the first minimum occurs at an angle where the Bessel function J1 reaches its first zero. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317.

So, the condition is:

(pi a sin(theta)) / lambda = 3.8317

So, sin(theta) = (3.8317 * lambda) / (pi * a)

Approximating sin(theta) as theta (since angles are small), we get:

theta ≈ (3.8317 * lambda) / (pi * a) ≈ (3.8317 / 3.1416) * (lambda / a) ≈ 1.220 * (lambda/a)

Ah, so the first minimum is at theta_1 ≈ 1.220 lambda/(a).

The second minimum of J1 occurs at the next zero, which is about 7.0156. So,

sin(theta_2) = (7.0156 lambda)/(pi a) → theta_2 ≈ (7.0156)/(pi) * (lambda/a) ≈ 2.233 (lambda/a).

Wait, but wait: the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, the second at 2.233 lambda/a. The distance between them would be 2.233 - 1.22 ≈ 1.013 lambda/a. But that's not one of the options. The options go up to 1.220, option C is 1.220 lambda/a.

Wait, but the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. So that would be between the first and second minima. But according to this, it would be about 1.013 lambda/a, but none of the options match that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Because when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the diffraction pattern is an Airy disk. The first minimum is at theta_1 ≈ 1.22 lambda/a. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. But perhaps the problem is considering the first minima, which is the first dark ring around the central maximum. So the first minima is at theta_1, the second at theta_2. But the angular spacing between them is theta_2 - theta_1, which as I calculated, is about 1.013 lambda/a, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the Airy disk and instead treating the polygon as an approximation of a single slit. Because for each side of the polygon, when N is large, the polygon has many sides, each acting as a slit. But that's probably not correct because the polygon is a 2D shape, and the diffraction pattern would be more complex.

Wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps the polygon is considered as a rectangular aperture, but that doesn't make sense because a polygon has a finite number of sides. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the single-slit formula, where the minima are at a sin(theta) = m lambda, where 'a' is the width of the slit. So for the first minimum, m=1, so theta = lambda/(a).

Wait, but in this case, the apertures are N-sided polygons with apothems 'a'. For each side, the length is s = 2a tan(pi/N). But as N becomes large, s≈ 2a (pi/N) → 0. So each side becomes infinitesimally small. But the overall shape becomes a circle of radius 'a' because for a polygon with infinitely many sides, the apothem 'a' is the radius.

But if each side is a slit of width s, then perhaps the problem is considering the diffraction from each side as a slit, but that's probably not the case because the entire polygon is the aperture.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a grating with N slits, but that seems unlikely given the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the Fraunhofer diffraction condition for a single slit, where the minima are at theta = m lambda/(a), where 'a' is the width of the slit. In that case, the first minimum is at theta = lambda/(a), the second at 2 lambda/(a), so the angular distance between them is lambda/(a). But that's not matching the options.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 1.220 lambda/a, which matches the first minimum for a circular aperture. But the question asks about the angular distance between the first two minima, so that would be the difference between the second and first minima.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single-slit with width equal to the apothem, but that seems incorrect because the width of the slit would be the length of each side, which is s = 2a tan(pi/N), which for large N approaches 2a (pi/N). So if N is very large, s is small.

Wait, but if each side is a very narrow slit, and there are N such slits arranged in a circle, perhaps the diffraction pattern would involve both the interference from each side and the overall shape. But that's getting complicated, and I'm perhaps overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the Airy disk, but about the polygon's diffraction pattern as a collection of rectangular apertures.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The angular spacing between minima in a circular aperture is not uniform, unlike in a grating. So the difference between the first and second minima is more than the spacing between higher minima.

But our earlier calculation suggested that the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, the second at 2.233 lambda/a, so the spacing is 1.013 lambda/a, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, but that can't be. Let me see the options again:

Options:
A) 0.610 λ / a
B) 0.500 λ / a
C) 1.220 λ /a 
D) 0.506 λ / a

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the question reduces to the circular aperture's diffraction pattern. The first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/(a), but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, the first minima after the central maximum is at 1.22 lambda/a, so the angular distance from the central maximum to the first minimum is 1.22 lambda/a, which is option C.

But the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, the first minimum is the first dark ring after the central maximum. The second minimum would be the next dark ring. So the distance between first and second minima would be the difference in their angles.

But according to the Airy disk, the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, the second at about 2.233 lambda/a (as per J1's second zero), so the difference is 1.013 lambda/a, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the zeros of Bessel functions. Let me double-check the zeros of J1.

J1's zeros are at approximately:

j1,1 = 3.8317,
j1,2 = 7.0156,
j1,3 = 10.1735,
j1,4 = 13.0152,
and so on.

So, for the first minimum, theta1 = (3.8317 * lambda) / (pi a) ≈ 1.220 lambda/a.

Second minimum, theta2 = (7.0156 * lambda) / (pi a) ≈ (7.0156/3.1416) lambda/a ≈ 2.233 lambda/a.

So the difference is theta2 - theta1 ≈ 2.233 - 1.220 = 1.013 lambda/a. But that's not an option.

Wait the options don't have that. The options are A: 0.610, B: 0.500, C:1.220, D:0.506.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case but something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 'a'. But wait, no. Because for a polygon, each side's length is s = 2a tan(pi/N). So as N→infinite, s → 2 a (pi/N), which goes to zero. So the entire polygon's width would be the sum of the sides, but no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps for an N-sided polygon, the overall width is 2a. Because the apothem is 'a', which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius (distance from center to a vertex) is R = a / cos(pi/N). When N is large, R ≈ a (1 - (pi^2)/(2 N^2)) ), but as N→infinite, R approaches 'a'.

Wait, but for a polygon, the width along one direction (say, the x-axis) would be 2R, so 2a. So if the polygon is approximated as a circle, the diameter is 2a. So applying the single-slit formula, the minima would be at theta = m lambda/(2a), where m is an integer. So the first minimum is at theta = lambda/(2a), the second at 2 lambda/(2a)=lambda/a, so the angular distance between them is lambda/(2a). But lambda/(2a) is 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But that's for a single slit of width 2a, but wait, no. Wait, in single-slit diffraction, the condition is a sin(theta) = m lambda, where a is the slit width. For the first minimum, m=1, so theta = lambda/(a). So if the slit width is 2a, the first minimum is at theta = lambda/(2a). Wait, that can't be right. Let me correct:

If the slit width is 'd', then the minima are at theta = m lambda/d. So for d=2a, the first minimum is at theta = lambda/(2a), second at 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. The angular distance between them is lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But earlier, when I considered the circular aperture, the first minimum was at 1.22 lambda/a. But according to this, if the polygon is approximated as a single slit of width 2a, then the angular distance between first and second minima would be 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

Wait, but the problem says the polygon has infinitely many sides, which would make the shape a circle. So perhaps the problem is treating the entire polygon as a single slit of width 'a' instead of 2a. So if the slit width is 'a', the first minimum is at theta = lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a. The angular distance between them is lambda/a. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is between the apothem and the radius. If the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a', then the diameter is 2a, which would make the width of the slit 2a. So the minima would be at theta = m lambda/(2a), and the angular distance between first and second minima would be lambda/(2a), which is option B. But then the first minimum is at theta = lambda/(2a), which is 0.5 lambda/a, but I don't see that in the options as the distance between minima.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0.610 λ / a

B) 0.500 λ / a

C) 1.220 λ /a 

D) 0.506 λ / a

Hmm, option B is 0.5 lambda/a, which would be the distance between the first and second minima if the first is at lambda/(2a), the second at lambda/a. So if the polygon is treated as a single slit of width 2a, the angular distance would be option B.

But earlier, I thought when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, which would have its own diffraction pattern with the first minimum at 1.22 lambda/a. But that's the position of the first minimum, not the spacing between the first and second.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a rectangular aperture with width 'a', leading to the first minimum at lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a, and the spacing is lambda/a, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the small angle approximation and considering the polygon as a series of slits, each with width s, leading to a grating-like diffraction pattern. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: For a polygon with a very large N, the shape approximates a circle. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture (the Airy disk) has its first minimum at theta ≈ 1.22 lambda/a, and the next minima are at larger angles. However, the angular spacing between consecutive minima in the Airy disk isn't uniform. So the distance between the first and second minima is about 1.013 lambda/a, which isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a single slit with width 'a', leading to minima at theta = m lambda/a. So the first minimum is at lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a, and the distance between them is lambda/a. But that's not among the options.

Wait, but the options include 1.220 lambda/a (option C), which matches the first minimum of the Airy disk. So perhaps the question is asking for the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two.

But the question clearly says, "the angular distance between the first two minima." So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the Airy disk at all. Maybe the polygon is being treated as a rectangular aperture, and the minima are calculated using the single-slit formula.

Wait, if the polygon is approximated as a rectangle with width 'a', then the minima would be at theta = m lambda/a. So the first minimum at m=1 is theta= lambda/a, the second at m=2 is 2 lambda/a, so the angular distance is lambda/a. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the rectangle's width is 2a, then the minima are at m lambda/(2a). So the first minimum is at lambda/(2a), the second at 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. The angular distance is lambda/(2a), which is 0.5 lambda/a, option B.

But earlier, I thought the circular case would give 1.22 lambda/a, but that's for a single minimum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit with width 'a', leading to minima at theta = m lambda/a. So the first minimum is at lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a. The angular distance between them is lambda/a, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me look back at the question.

The apertures are N-sided polygons with all apothems of length 'a'. So each side is a distance 'a' from the center. When N is infinitely large, this becomes a circle with radius 'a'. So the diameter is 2a. So for a single-slit of width 2a, the minima are at theta = m lambda/(2a). So the first minimum is at lambda/(2a), the second at 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. So the angular distance between the first and second minima is lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But why does this approach not align with the Airy disk?

Ah, perhaps in this problem, the assumption is that as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a single slit of width 2a, leading to the single-slit diffraction pattern. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But earlier, when considering the circular aperture (Airy disk), the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, which would be option C. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which in the single-slit case is 0.5 lambda/a.

So which approach is correct?

Hmm, the problem states that the aperture is a polygon, and when N is infinite, it's a circle. So the diffraction should be that of a circular aperture, but perhaps the question is simplifying it to a single slit.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the polygon as a rectangular slit of width 'a', leading to minima at theta = m lambda/a. So the first minimum is at lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a, so the distance is lambda/a, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a slit of width 'a' but considering the polygon as a circle of radius 'a', leading to a diameter of 2a. Then the single-slit formula would have minima at theta = m lambda/(2a). So the first minimum is at lambda/(2a), the second at 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. The distance between them is lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But then why does the circular case's first minimum not align with that? Because in the circular case, the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a mix-up. Let me think again. Another way to approach: for a circular aperture, the minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum is at theta1 = 1.22 lambda/a, the second at theta2 = 2.233 lambda/a. The angular distance between them is theta2 - theta1 = 1.013 lambda/a. But this isn't an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 0.506 lambda/a, which is approximately 1.013/2. So perhaps the problem is considering something else, like the distance from the center to the first minimum, which would be 1.22 lambda/a (option C) but the question is about the distance between the first two minima.

But that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a rectangular aperture with width 'a', leading to minima at theta = m lambda/a. So between m=1 and m=2, the angular distance is lambda/a. But that isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap:

- N is very large → polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a' (since the apothem is 'a').

- The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture (Airy disk) has minima at theta where (pi a sin theta)/lambda = j_{1,m}, where j_{1,m} is the m-th zero of J1.

- First minimum at theta1 = (j_{1,1} lambda)/(pi a) ≈ (3.8317 lambda)/(3.1416 a) ≈ 1.220 lambda/a.

- Second minimum at theta2 = (j_{1,2} lambda)/(pi a) ≈ (7.0156 lambda)/(3.1416 a) ≈ 2.233 lambda/a.

- The angular distance between them is theta2 - theta1 ≈ 1.013 lambda/a, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case but instead using the single-slit formula.

- If the polygon is treated as a slit of width 'a', the first minimum is at theta = lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a, so the distance is lambda/a (not an option).

- If the width is '2a', the distance is lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But why would the width be '2a'? Because for a circle with radius 'a', the diameter is 2a, so perhaps the problem is treating the width as 2a.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The angular spacing between the minima in a single-slit diffraction pattern is uniform. The minima are at theta = m lambda/a, so the spacing is lambda/a. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which is lambda/a. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is treated as a collection of N slits, each of width 's', and the diffraction pattern is like a grating. But that's more complicated.

Wait, but when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, but the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which is 1.013 lambda/a, which isn't an option.

But the options don't have that value. The closest is option D: 0.506 lambda/a, which is approximately half of 1.013.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the zeros of J1. Let me check the zeros again.

Wait, J1's first zero is 3.8317, the second is 7.0156. So the difference is 7.0156 − 3.8317 = 3.1839.

So, (7.0156 -3.8317) * lambda/(pi a) = 3.1839 * lambda/(3.1416 a) ≈ 1.013 lambda/a.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', and the minima are at m lambda/a. So the first minimum is at lambda/a (1.000 lambda/a), the second at 2 lambda/a, so the angular distance is lambda/a. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a collection of N slits, each of width 's', arranged in a circle. Then, the diffraction pattern would be a combination of the single-slit pattern and the diffraction from the circular array. But that's a more advanced topic, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the polygon as a rectangular slit of width 'a', leading to minima at theta = m lambda/a. The angular distance between the first two minima is lambda/a, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for multiple slits, where the angular spacing is lambda/(Na), but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider how the polygon's diffraction relates to the single-slit case. For a regular polygon, the width in one direction is 2R, where R is the radius. As N approaches infinity, R approaches 'a' (since the apothem is 'a'). So the width is 2a.

If the polygon is treated as a single slit of width 2a, then the minima are at theta = m lambda/(2a). So the first minimum is at theta1 = lambda/(2a), the second at theta2 = 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. The angular distance between them is theta2 - theta1 = (lambda/a - lambda/(2a)) = lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which in this case would be 0.5 lambda/a, option B.

However, earlier, I thought the circular case gives the first minimum at 1.22 lambda/a, but perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit with width 2a, leading to option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says that all apothems are of the same length 'a'. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, this becomes a circle with radius 'a' (since the apothem is the same as the radius for a circle). So the diameter is 2a.

So the width of the slit would be 2a. So the first minimum is at m=1: theta = lambda/(2a), the second at m=2: theta = 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. The angular distance between them is lambda/(2a), which is option B: 0.500 lambda/a.

But then why is option C present? Because option C is 1.220 lambda/a, which is the first minimum of the Airy disk. So perhaps the problem is expecting that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a circular aperture, so the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, which would be option C. But the question asks for the distance between the first two minima, which would require the second minimum. But the options don't include 1.013 lambda/a.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the first two minima after the central maximum. So the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, the second at 2.233 lambda/a, so the distance between them is 1.013 lambda/a, which isn't an option.

But the options do include 0.506 lambda/a (option D), which is approximately half of that.

Wait, 1.013 is about twice 0.506. So perhaps the problem is considering the distance from the center to the first minimum (1.22 lambda/a) and then the distance from the first to the second is 0.506 lambda/a. But that doesn't make sense because the angular positions are additive.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit with width 'a', leading to minima at theta = m lambda/a. So first minimum at theta1 = lambda/a, second at theta2 = 2 lambda/a. The angular distance is lambda/a. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a rectangular aperture with width 'a' and height 'a', making it a square. But that's not a polygon with infinitely many sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a single slit, but the width is 'a', leading to the first minimum at theta = lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a. So the angular distance is lambda/a, which is not an option.

Wait, but looking at option D: 0.506 lambda/a. 0.506 is approximately 1.013/2. So if the correct angular distance is 1.013 lambda/a, but it's not an option, perhaps the problem is considering only the first minimum, which is 1.22 lambda/a (option C). But that's not the distance between minima.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Bessel function zeros. Let me check an online source or table.

Upon checking, J1's first zero is approximately 3.8317, the second is 7.0156.

So, the angular distance is (7.0156-3.8317) * (lambda)/(pi a) = (3.1839) * (lambda)/(3.1416 a) ≈ 1.013 lambda/a.

But this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the distance between the first and second minima as the difference between the first and zeroth order, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance between the first and second minima in terms of the diffraction pattern's spacing formula, which for a grating is lambda/(d), but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the spacing between adjacent minima in a single-slit pattern, which is uniform and lambda/a. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C, 1.220 lambda/a, which is the first minimum of the Airy disk, but the question is about the distance between the first two minima. So if the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, the second is at 2.233 lambda/a, their difference is 1.013 lambda/a, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question intended to ask for the position of the first minimum, which would be option C.

But the question clearly states it's asking for the angular distance between the first two minima, so that approach is incorrect.

Hmm. Let me think again: perhaps the problem is not about the circular case but about the polygon as a rectangular slit. For a rectangular slit of width 'a', the minima are at theta = m lambda/a. So the first minimum is at 1.000 lambda/a, the second at 2.000, so the distance is 1. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture but using the first minimum as the angular spacing between the first and second maxima, but that's not the case.

I'm stuck. Given the options, and the fact that the correct answer for the circular case's first minimum is 1.22 lambda/a (option C), but the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which would be approximately 1.013 lambda/a, it's not present. The closest option is D: 0.506 lambda/a, which is about half of 1.013.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:

j1,1=3.8317, j1,2=7.0156.

Difference: 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839.

So, theta2 - theta1 = (3.1839 * lambda) / (pi a).

3.1839 / 3.1416 ≈ 1.013.

So theta2 - theta1 ≈ 1.013 lambda/a.

But none of the options have that. The only option close is D: 0.506 lambda/a, which is exactly half.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Bessel function zeros. Let me check another source.

Upon checking, J1's first zero is approximately 3.8317, the second is about 7.0156.

So, the difference is 3.1839, which when divided by pi gives 1.013.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option D: 0.506.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the single-slit formula with the width as 'a', leading to the minima at theta = m lambda/a. So the angular distance between the first and second minima is lambda/a, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', and the minima are at theta = m lambda/(a). The first minimum is at m=1: theta= lambda/a, the second at m=2: theta= 2 lambda/a. The angular distance is lambda/a, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if the width is 'a/2', then the minima would be at theta = (m lambda)/(a/2) = 2 m lambda/a. So first minimum at 2 lambda/a, the second at 4 lambda/a, the distance would be 2 lambda/a. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular slit of width '2a', leading to minima at theta = m lambda/(2a). So the first minimum is at m=1: theta= lambda/(2a), the second at m=2: theta= lambda/a. The angular distance is lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But earlier, I thought the circular case would have the first minimum at 1.22 lambda/a, but perhaps the problem is expecting the single-slit approach, leading to option B.

But why is option C present? It's the position of the first minimum when the aperture is a circle.

I think I'm stuck between options B and C, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which for a circular aperture isn't matching any of the options, but for a single-slit of width 2a, the distance is 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 0.506 lambda/a, which is approximately 1.013/2, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, 0.506 is approximately 3.8317/(2 pi), which is 3.8317/6.283 ≈ 0.609. Not matching.

Alternatively, 3.8317/(2 pi) is about 0.609, which is option A.

Hmm. I'm not sure, but given the options and the calculations, I think the intended answer is option C, 1.220 lambda/a, which is the position of the first minimum for a circular aperture. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which would be approximately 1.013 lambda/a, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', leading to the first minimum at lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a, and the angular distance between them is lambda/a, which isn't an option. So I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a slit of width 'a', and the minima are at theta = m lambda/a. So the first minimum is at theta= lambda/a (1.000), the second at 2 lambda/a, so the distance is lambda/a. But that's not an option.

I think I've tried all possible angles, and perhaps the intended answer is option D: 0.506 lambda/a, which is approximately 3.8317/(2 pi), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the angle between the first and second minima in a single-slit pattern, which is lambda/a, but that's not present.

Wait, maybe I should choose option D: 0.506 lambda/a, because 0.506 is approximately half of 1.013, but I don't have a clear reasoning for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first minimum at 1.22 lambda/a, and the distance from the central maximum to the first minimum is 1.22 lambda/a, which is option C.

Given the confusion and the options provided, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C: 1.220 lambda/a, which is the position of the first minimum for a circular aperture. However, since the question asks for the distance between the first two minima, and that's not directly matching any option, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', leading to the first minima at lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a, so the distance is lambda/a. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the intensity minima in a single-slit diffraction, and the angular distance between consecutive minima is lambda/a. But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step in the calculation. Let me think about the problem again.

The polygon is regular, with apothem 'a'. For each side, the width is s = 2a tan(pi/N). As N approaches infinity, tan(pi/N) ≈ pi/N, so s ≈ 2a (pi/N). So each side becomes very narrow, but the number of sides increases. So the overall width of the polygon is 2a (the diameter of the circle).

So treating it as a single slit of width 2a, the minima are at theta = m lambda/(2a). So the first minimum is at m=1: theta = lambda/(2a), the second at m=2: theta=2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. The angular distance between them is lambda/(2a), which is 0.5 lambda/a, option B.

But then the first minimum is at 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B, but the question is about the angular distance between first and second minima, which is also 0.5 lambda/a.

Ah, perhaps that's the reasoning.

So when N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle with diameter 2a. So treating it as a single slit of width 2a, the minima are at theta = m lambda/(2a). So the first minimum is at m=1: theta = (1 * lambda)/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a. The second minimum is at m=2: theta= (2 * lambda)/(2a) = lambda/a. The angular distance between them is (lambda/a - 0.5 lambda/a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

Thus, the correct answer would be option B: 0.500 lambda/a.

But wait, earlier I thought the circular case gives the first minimum at 1.22 lambda/a, but perhaps that's only when considering the entire circle as an aperture, not as a slit.

Hmm. I think I'm getting more confident that the correct answer is option B: 0.500 lambda/a.


The problem involves a polygonal aperture with N sides, where all apothems are of length \( a \). When \( N \) approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius \( a \). A monochromatic light of wavelength \( \lambda \) falls vertically on this aperture, creating a diffraction pattern in the far field. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in this pattern.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Polygon to Circle Transition**:  
   As \( N \to \infty \), the polygon approximates a circle with radius \( a \). The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is characterized by the Airy disk, where the minima occur at angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \( J_1 \).

2. **Airy Disk Minima**:  
   The minima in the Airy disk are given by the condition:  
   \[
   \sin\theta = \frac{\lambda j_{1,m}}{\pi a},
   \]  
   where \( j_{1,m} \) is the \( m \)-th zero of \( J_1 \). The first two zeros of \( J_1 \) are approximately \( j_{1,1} = 3.8317 \) and \( j_{1,2} = 7.0156 \). Using the small-angle approximation (\( \sin\theta \approx \theta \)), the angular positions of the first two minima are:  
   \[
   \theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{\pi a}.
   \]  
   The angular distance between the first two minima is:  
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{\pi a} \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 1.013 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]  
   However, this value does not match any of the provided options.

3. **Single-Slit Approximation**:  
   If the polygon is treated as a single slit of width \( 2a \) (the diameter of the circle), the minima occur at:  
   \[
   \theta = \frac{m \lambda}{2a}, \quad m = 1, 2, 3, \dots
   \]  
   For \( m = 1 \), the first minimum is at \( \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{2a} \), and for \( m = 2 \), the second minimum is at \( \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{2a} = \frac{\lambda}{a} \). The angular distance between the first two minima is:  
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a} - \frac{\lambda}{2a} = \frac{\lambda}{2a}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to \( 0.500 \frac{\lambda}{a} \), which matches **Option B**.

4. **Reconciling with the Options**:  
   The Airy disk calculation gives a distance of \( 1.013 \frac{\lambda}{a} \), but this is not among the options. The single-slit approximation yields \( 0.500 \frac{\lambda}{a} \), which aligns with **Option B**. Given the problem's phrasing and the provided options, the single-slit interpretation is likely the intended approach.

### Conclusion:
The angular distance between the first two minima is best approximated by treating the aperture as a single slit of width \( 2a \), leading to an angular spacing of \( 0.500 \frac{\lambda}{a} \).

**Answer: B**
