Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up in the mice. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: There's a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're looking at their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with certain structuresâ€”eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. 

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor could be expressed as a separate transcript, using the same vector but maybe a different promoter? Or perhaps the IRES drives the receptor expression after the ligand? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different recombinase sites. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So if Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette. 

So the setup is probably using a Cre system to control expression. The idea is that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ORFs to be expressed. Otherwise, the stops prevent expression. 

They used antibodies against overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot uses total proteins, with actin as a loading control. So they're checking if the ligand and receptor are expressed. But in the mouse model, they crossed the homozygous construct into SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre would be active there. 

But after the offspring are born, they don't see a green signal. The eGFP is on the receptor. So why no green? Let's consider the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but I'm not sure how that affects expression. The construct is designed to express both in the same cells, perhaps. Wait, if they're paracrine, maybe the ligand is secreted, but the construct expresses both in the same cells. I'm not sure if this directly affects the expression of the fluorescent proteins. Maybe not the main issue here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce. But why would the Western blot show it? Maybe the protein is made but not trafficked, so it's present in the cell but not on the surface. But in the Western blot, if the antibody detects the eGFP (or the receptor part), it would show a band. The question says the Western blot after transfection shows signals proportional to actin. Wait, no, the question says that after plasmid transfection to astrocyte culture, they used the antibodies. So maybe in the initial testing, they saw expression. But in the mouse model, no green. So maybe in the mouse, the construct isn't being expressed, but in the cells, it was.

Option C: The enhancer for expression is missing. The construct uses CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe the problem isn't the promoter. The IRES is supposed to drive the receptor's expression without needing a promoter, or maybe with a different one. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the receptor isn't being expressed. But the setup includes the IRES, which often doesn't require a promoter. So maybe without the right regulatory elements, the receptor isn't expressed. Alternatively, the SOX10-Cre might not be activating the right parts.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with lox sites. The ligand is under CBA, which is constitutive. The receptor is under IRES, perhaps under the control of a different promoter. Or, perhaps the IRES is only active if the preceding ORF is not terminated. Hmm, maybe the IRES is part of a system where Cre is needed to splice the transcripts correctly.

Wait, the stop cassettes. Let me think: the ligand ORF is followed by stop in loxP sites. The receptor ORF is followed by stop in lox2272. So, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since the stop is after mCherry), but the receptor would be under the stop, so not expressed. When Cre is present (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), it would cut out the loxP stop and the lox2272 stop. So the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

But wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the two ORFs are in the same transcript? Or are they separate? No, bicistronic vectors usually have two ORFs in a single transcript
