Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop counts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on QFT, but let me think. Alright, the question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some scribbled terms next to it. The terms are alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And we're supposed to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, I remember that in Feynman diagrams, each loop contributes a certain factor to the amplitude, and that factors like the coupling constants and denominators involving pi might be related to loop integrals. Also, the number of loops is related to the order of the process—like, each loop typically adds a certain power of the coupling constants and maybe some factors from integrals.

So thinking about the general structure. For a Feynman diagram, the number of loops L can be determined by the superficial degree of divergence or via the formula related to the number of propagators and vertices. But wait, maybe this is more about the scaling with energy or the overall scaling of the amplitude.

Let me consider the scaling factors. The term (Q/M)^2 is dimensionless; perhaps it's a ratio of some energy scale Q over another M. The rest of the terms are coupling constants and factors from loop integrals.

Wait, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) per loop in 4 dimensions, right? Because in 4-D spacetime, the loop integrals often give factors like 1/(epsilon) from dimensional regularization, but the coefficients involve terms like (4 pi)^epsilon. Alternatively, when you do loop integrals, you get factors like (4 pi)^{d/2 - n}, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, for each loop integral in 4D, the typical factor is something like (4 pi)^{epsilon} where epsilon is (4 - d)/2, but that's for dimensional regularization. Alternatively, when you evaluate a loop integral in 4D, you often get a factor like 1/(16 pi^2) for each loop. Or wait, actually, for each loop in a Feynman diagram, you get an integral that is typically of the form ∫ d^4k
