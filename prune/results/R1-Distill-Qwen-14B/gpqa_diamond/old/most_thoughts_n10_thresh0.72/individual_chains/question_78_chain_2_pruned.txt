Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the potentials V and A. Let me think about what I know.

The problem gives a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). We're looking for the potentials at a point r at time t, given that t is greater than tr, which is the time when the field was generated. Oh wait, the vector d is the displacement from where the field was generated to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr), right?

I think the potentials are determined using the retarded time concept because the fields propagate at the speed of light. So the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr. For scalar potential V, it's usually something like Coulomb's law but adjusted for the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε0)) times something. I recall that for a static charge, V is q/(4πε0 r), but when the charge is moving, the expression might involve the retarded time. So maybe V = q/(4πε0) * [1/(d - (v t_r)/c) ]? Wait, no, d is the vector, so I need to think about the denominator correctly.

Wait, another way. The general expression for the scalar potential from a moving charge is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/( |r - s(tr)| - (v · (r - s(tr)))/c² ) ]. Or something like that. Because the field is retarded, so the denominator includes a term with the velocity and the position difference.

Looking at the options, option C and D have expressions involving (d c - dot product). Let me see what the denominator looks like. Option C has d c minus dot d and v. So wait, in the denominator, it's (d c - d · v). Hmm, that doesn't look dimensionally correct. Because d is a vector, but multiplying by c would make it units of velocity times distance. Hmm, wait, perhaps d is the magnitude of vector d? Because in the denominator of the scalar potential, it should be a scalar.

Wait,
