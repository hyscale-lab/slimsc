Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a series of organic reactions leading to a final product, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in that product. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. That gives product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to make product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is about the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Alright, let's break this down reaction by reaction.

First reaction: Starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is a norbornene structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, structure-wise, it's a bicyclic system with an oxygen group attached.

Next, the reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, especially in an SN2 reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, I think. So, perhaps this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Or some kind of cycloaddition?

Wait, the starting material is a diene (bicyclo with two double bonds?), and the other compound is a dienophile? Or maybe it's a cross metathesis? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. Let me think. The 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons. Each dibromomethyl is Br2C-CH2-.

But when sodium iodide is present, the iodide ion (I-) would substitute the bromide. But wait, if there are two dibromomethyl groups, perhaps each can undergo substitution. Since the starting material is a diene, maybe the diene is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, no. The Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. Let me think about the structures. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene has two double bonds, which might make it a diene or a conjugated diene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4
