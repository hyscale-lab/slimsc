Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm. Astronomers observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range? So, it's asking about the relationship between N and distance r.

Wait, first, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. Like, plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So, as distance r increases, parallax decreases.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/(1/r)^5 is the same as (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but that would mean the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, that can't be right, because more distant stars would have less parallax, but why would the number of stars in a region increase with distance? That seems counterintuitive because you'd think the density of stars decreases with distance, so the number per volume would drop off.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me
