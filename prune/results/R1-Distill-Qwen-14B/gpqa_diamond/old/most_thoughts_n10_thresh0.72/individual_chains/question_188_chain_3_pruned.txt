Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography here, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me see what I remember about rhombohedral structures.

First, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal, and all the angles are the same. So, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, which I think is denoted by a single a. In this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, so a = 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. 

Wait, wait. No, wait. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. In a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance refers to the edge length, so a = 10 Angstroms. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a cube that's been skewed, but all edges are the same length. So a is the edge length, which is 10.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh)cos(theta) )) ), but wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, I recall that for cubic systems, it's simpler, but rhombohedral is a bit trickier because of the angles.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \gamma } }

But wait, wait, no. I think I might have mixed up the formula. Alternatively, another approach is using the structure factor or the Miller indices directly. Hmm.

Wait, in the case of a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameters are a = b = c, and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma). So the interplanar distance can be calculated using a specific formula for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, I think the formula for d in a rhombohedral
