Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. I remember that in nuclear physics, when particles decay, they often emit other particles. The question involves two different decay processes, so I need to compare their outcomes, specifically the energy spectrum of the E particles.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with some endpoint Q. I think the endpoint is the maximum energy the E particles can have. Then there's a variant where instead of 2V, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the variant reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, so in the original case, two V particles are emitted along with two E's. In the variant, it's one M and two E's. M is massless and exotic, so maybe it's like a photon or a neutrino? But neutrinos have mass, so maybe M is like a photon, which is massless.

I'm trying to remember about energy spectra in decay processes. When a heavy nucleus emits particles, the energy distribution depends on whether the emitted particles are massive or massless. For example, in beta decay, electrons have a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy. But if you have a photon emitted instead, like in gamma decay, the photon would have a continuous spectrum as well, but maybe the energy distribution changes.

Wait, in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. So E must be some particle that can have varying energy. In beta decay, the electrons (E) get a continuous distribution because the emitted antineutrino (V or something else) takes away energy. 

So in the first case, the decay produces 2E and 2V. Let's think about what V is. If V is a neutrino-like particle, then each E would have a maximum energy when the V takes the least possible energy. But since both E and V are emitted, maybe their energies are related.

In the variant, instead of two V's, you have one M, which is massless. So the products are 2E + M. How does this affect the E spectrum?

Hmm, if M is massless, maybe it's like a photon or a gluon, which doesn't have rest mass. So M would carry away energy and momentum, but since it's massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c (but in units where c=1, energy equals momentum). 

Wait, in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum because the V's take away some energy. But in the variant, there's only one M. So how does that affect the E's maximum energy?

Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum. In the first case, 2V are emitted, which are presumably massless (since they're much lighter than A and B). So each V is massless, which means their energy is all due to motion. 

In the original decay, each E would have a maximum energy when the V's are emitted with the minimum possible energy (but not zero, because they have to carry
