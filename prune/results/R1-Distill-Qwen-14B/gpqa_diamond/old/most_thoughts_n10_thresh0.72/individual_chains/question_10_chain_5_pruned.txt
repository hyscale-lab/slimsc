Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, higher mass and smaller volume would lead to higher density. 

Let's look at each option one by one.

Option a: This is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, it's basically Earth. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So, that's our baseline.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given here. So if the density is 5.5, same as Earth, but it's more massive. But wait, does mass affect density when volume is considered? Wait, if the mass is more but density is same, then the volume must be larger. Because density is mass/volume. So if density is the same, higher mass implies larger volume. So the radius would be larger. But the question is about the highest density. Since the density here is 5.5, same as Earth, so this planet's density isn't higher than others unless others are lower.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Hmm, composition same as Earth, so same density? Wait, no. Wait, Earth
