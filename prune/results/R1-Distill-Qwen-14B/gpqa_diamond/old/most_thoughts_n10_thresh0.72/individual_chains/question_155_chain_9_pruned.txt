Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in P_z for a given quantum state. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

Wait, the state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Hmm, so the system is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That probably means that the components of this vector are the amplitudes in each eigenstate of P_z.

I also remember that the uncertainty in an operator (like P_z) is given by the square root of the expectation value of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ).

But wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, I wonder how that relates to P_z. Oh, but since the basis is P_z's eigenbasis, the state can be directly expressed in terms of P_z's eigenstates. So, each component of the vector is the amplitude for each eigenstate of P_z.

So, first step: I need to compute <P_z>, which is the expectation value of P_z. Then compute <P_z²>, which for diagonal operators is just the expectation value of each eigenvalue squared, weighted by the probabilities.

Wait, let me think about the matrix forms. The P_z matrix is given as:

[ ħ    0      0    ]
[ 0    0      0    ]
[ 0    0    -ħ    ]

So, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of P_z. So the eigenstates are |+z>, |0z>, and |-z> corresponding to the first, second, and third basis vectors, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively.

The state vector is given as ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ). Let me check the normalization. The sum of squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating each component:

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4,
(1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2,
(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So it's normalized. Good.

So, the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. The coefficients are, in order, a= -1/2 (for eigenvalue ħ), b=1/sqrt(2) (for eigenvalue 0), and c= -1/2 (for eigenvalue -ħ).

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues correspond to the basis vectors. So the first component is for the state with eigenvalue +ħ, the second for 0
