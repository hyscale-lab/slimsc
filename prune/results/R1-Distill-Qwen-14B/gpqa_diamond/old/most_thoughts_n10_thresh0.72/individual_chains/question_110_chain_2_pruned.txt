Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I need to figure this out step by step. 

First, the question gives me some information about the stars' magnitudes, distances, and some extinction values. I remember that apparent magnitude determines how bright a star appears from Earth, which is crucial for detection. Also, both telescopes have different magnitude limits for detection. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. Wait, no, wait: the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 mag" for HIRES. So that means ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag. Because higher magnitudes are dimmer. So a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17, so it's within ESPRESSO's range. But a star with 17 would be at the limit for ESPRESSO, but not for HIRES, which can go down to 16.

Wait, let me get that straight. The question says: ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, brighter than magnitude 17. So if a star's apparent V is brighter (lower number) than 17, ESPRESS
