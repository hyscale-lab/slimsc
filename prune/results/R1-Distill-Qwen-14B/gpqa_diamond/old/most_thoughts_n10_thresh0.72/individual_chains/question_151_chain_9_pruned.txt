Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector v = [-1; 2; 1]. And the observable is represented by matrix P. The matrix P has first row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

The question is about finding the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0 at time t.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors of the operator. So I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are zero because we're looking for the probability of getting zero.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think again. The observable is a matrix, and when you measure it, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of P. Then, the probability of getting each eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector components when expressed in the basis of the state vector.

But wait, another approach: the expectation value of the observable is given by the state vector's conjugate transpose multiplied by the matrix and then multiplied by the state vector. But that's for expectation, not the probability of a specific outcome.

Wait, no, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. But for the probability of a specific eigenvalue, like 0, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector.

So the plan is:

1. Find the eigenvalues of matrix P.
2. Identify which eigenvalue is 0.
3. Find the corresponding eigenvector(s) for that eigenvalue.
4. Compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector(s).
5. The probability is the square of the absolute value of that projection.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P is diagonal? No, looking at P, it's not diagonal. It has non-zero elements in the off-diagonal positions. So eigenvalues might not be obvious.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvalues of P.
