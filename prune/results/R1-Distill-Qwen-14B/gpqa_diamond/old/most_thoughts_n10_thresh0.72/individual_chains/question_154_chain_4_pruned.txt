Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what this unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, I'm thinking about what that extra mass could be. The molecular ion is at 156, and the fragment is 158, which is 2 Da higher. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Or maybe the molecular ion is 156, and the fragment is 158. Alternatively, the molecular ion might have a chlorine isotope.

Wait, chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5. So if the molecular formula includes a chlorine, we'll have isotopic peaks. Let me think. The molecular ion is at m/z 156, and if the molecular formula includes Cl, then the M+ would be 156, and the M+Cl would be 156 + 2 (since Cl can have a +2 isotope?), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe there's a Cl in the molecule, so the molecular ion is M (156) and then M+2 is 158, which would explain the 32% peak. Cl typically has about 35% abundance for the M+2 isotope, so that makes sense. So the molecular formula probably includes a Cl atom. So the molecular weight is 156, and adding Cl gives 158, which is why that peak is present.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually suggest either an -OH (alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an -NH stretch, but since there's no mention of N in the options, it's probably -OH. But another thing is that carboxylic acids have a broad peak due to the O-H stretch. Alternatively, an aldehyde's -CHO would have a sharp peak around 2800-2720 cm^-1, but that's for the aldehyde C-H stretch. Wait, but in the IR, the broad peak from 350
