Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

So, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in a series and ran three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which probably means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember the slope in qPCR is related to efficiency. The formula is something like slope = ln(10)/log10(efficiency), but wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the slope is usually calculated as -3.32 when efficiency is 100%, because each tenfold increase in DNA takes about 3.32 cycles. So a slope of -3.3 is close enough, maybe just rounded.

Now looking at the results. The Ct values for each concentration are pretty close. Let's see:

At 100,000 copies: Ct is 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So an average around 34.2.

At 10,000: Ct is about 30.9. So a decrease of about 3.3 cycles. That makes sense because the concentration is ten times lower, and with 100% efficiency, each tenfold dilution should take about 3.3 cycles. So 34.2 minus 3.3 is 30.9, which matches. Same for the next steps.

1000 copies: Ct is 27.3. 30.9 minus 3.3 is 27.6, but the average is 27.6. Hmm, wait, the data says 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. So the average is 27.6. That's a bit different. 30.9 -3.3 = 27.6. So that's spot on.

Then 100 copies: Ct is 24.0 on average. 27.6 -3.3 is 24.3. Oh, but the data is 24, 24.3, 24.6. So the average is 24.3. So the expected would be around 24.3, which matches.

Then 10 copies: Ct is around 21.0. Because 24.3 minus 3.3 is 21.0. The data is 20.7, 21.0, 21.3, so average is 21.0. That fits.

Wait, but why then are the Ct values for 1000 copies at 27.3, 27.6, 27.9? The expected was 27.6. So each step is exactly 3.3 cycles apart. Except maybe the first step is a bit off.

Wait, the question is about discrepancies. Let me look at the options.

Option A: qPCR can't be used for quantification. No, because the data fits perfectly. R² is 1, so it's a great curve.

Option B: Ct values don't match target nucleic acid. But the data fits exactly with the expected. So no, this isn't the case.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because a ten-fold dilution should require 3.3 cycles. So if the dilution was more, like a 100-fold, that would be about 6.6 cycles. But the question says the dilutions were ten-fold each. So each step is a ten-fold, so 3.3 cycles. That's correct.

Option D: Deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at each set, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The difference between the highest and lowest is 0.6. So each replicate varies by about 0.3 (like 34.2-33.9=0.3). So the deviation is within 0.3. So the maximum is 0.6, but the average difference is 0.3. So is that a problem? Well, in qPCR, technical replicates should ideally have a low standard deviation, like within 0.3 cycles. So if they're within that, it's acceptable. So the deviations here are actually within acceptable ranges. So option D says the deviation is more than 0.3, but in reality, it's exactly 0.3 (like 34.5-34.2=0.3). Wait, wait, more than 0.3 would mean over, but here it's exactly 0.3. Hmm, but maybe the question isn't precise. So perhaps the option D is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about discrepancies. The Ct values are perfectly in line with the expected, given the 100% efficiency and the 3.3 slope. So why are the results as such? There's no discrepancy in the data. The question says: which explains the discrepancies in his results? Oh wait, the question is why are the results as they are. But the data seems perfect. So perhaps the issue is that the Ct values aren't as expected, but in this case, they are. So the options must be pointing to something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says, which explains the discrepancies in his results. But looking at the data, the Ct values are exactly following the expected pattern. So maybe the question is tricking me. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are about possible explanations for the discrepancies. But the data seems to have no discrepancies because R² is 1 and the slope is correct. So maybe the issue is that the Ct values don't correspond to the dilution steps, but in this case, they do.

Wait, maybe I need to think about something else. Oh, wait, the positive control is serially diluted, so each step is a tenfold. But the Ct values are each about 3.3 lower. So each Ct is 3.3 lower than the previous, which is correct because 10x dilution. So the data is perfect. So why is the question about discrepancies?

Wait, perhaps the question is pointing out that the data doesn't have discrepancies, but the options suggest possible issues. Since the R² is 1 and the slope is correct, the data is perfect, so the only possible issue is perhaps the efficiency.

Wait, but the efficiency is stated as 100%, so that's correct. So perhaps the question is about the technical replicates. Let's look at each set. The Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The maximum difference is 0.6, and the standard deviation would be around 0.15 or so. So within acceptable limits. So option D says the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Well, each set has a range of 0.6, which is more than 0.3. So if the deviation between replicates is more than 0.3, that's a problem. Because, in technical replicates, you should have low variability. So if the CT values vary more than 0.3, it's a sign of issues. So in each set, the range is 0.6, which is double the acceptable. So that would be a problem. So option D says the deviation is more than 0.3, which would explain the discrepancies.

Wait, but in the data, the triplicates are 33.9, 34.2, 34.
