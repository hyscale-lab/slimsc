Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, first, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My task is to figure out the chemical formula among the four options given: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me start by looking at each piece of data one by one.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, I also remember that carbonyl groups (like C=O) don't show up at 3000. So the broad peak is probably O-H. But then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl stretch, like maybe a ketone or ester. But then 1650 is a bit lower. That might be an aromatic ring (C=C) or maybe conjugated groups. Wait, but another possibility is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a ketone with some resonance. Or perhaps it's an acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has several peaks, including some for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in a CH2=CH group. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene. Or perhaps it's part of a ring, like in a cyclohexene or something.

Now the Mass Spec: the fragment peak is at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments could give m/z 45. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43, but close), or maybe something like (CH2)2O, but wait, that might be 44. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with a carbonyl group, like an aldehyde or ketone. Or perhaps a water molecule (18) plus something else. Wait, m/z 45 could be C3H7O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+ is 91, so that's not it). Maybe a fragment from a larger molecule breaking off a smaller part.

Let me think about the possible formulas given:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

I need to figure out which of these fits the data.

First, let's think about the IR. O-H stretch suggests either an alcohol or perhaps a carboxylic acid. But a broad peak could also be an amide, but that's not one of the options here. Wait, but wait, the presence of a carbonyl (like C=O) at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone with an O-H group. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H, but then the carbonyl would be around 1700. But if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1730-1750, but maybe conjugation could lower it. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, which would lower the wavenumber. So 1700 could be an ester or a ketone, and 1650 might be an aromatic ring (maybe a carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl). So maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the IR also shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol group, but that might not be possible because esters are usually from carboxylic acids and alcohols. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an alcohol group. Or maybe it's a beta-keto alcohol or something.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have both a carbonyl and an O-H group, but wait, no, lactones are cyclic esters, so they don't have a free -OH; the OH is part of the ring as an ether. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused there.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl group. But that might not fit the data
