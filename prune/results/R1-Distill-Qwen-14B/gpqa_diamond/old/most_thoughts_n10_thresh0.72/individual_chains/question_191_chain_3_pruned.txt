Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with a specific compound, and I need to determine the final product, product 4. Let's break down each step carefully.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I need to visualize this structure. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so, -CH2OH attached to the ring). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached via the middle carbon, right? So, it's CH2-C(CH2)-CH2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Or wait, maybe I should draw it out. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The prop-1-en-2-yl group would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, no, let me think again. The structure is CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(=CH2)-, so the group is CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond starting at the first carbon. No, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me check: prop-1-en-2-yl group is actually CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but the group is attached at C2. So, the structure would be CH2=C(CH2-) something. Maybe it's better to think of it
