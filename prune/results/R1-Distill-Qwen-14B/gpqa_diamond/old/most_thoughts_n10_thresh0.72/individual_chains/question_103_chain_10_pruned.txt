Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let's break that down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethan-1-one is acetone, with the ketone group on the first carbon. So the phenyl group is attached to the first carbon of acetone. The substituents on the benzene ring are bromo and nitro groups. The positions are 3 and 5, which are meta to each other because on a benzene ring, positions 3 and 5 are across from each other, but wait, no, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me draw this mentally. If the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, that's the same as positions 1,3,5 if it's a tri-substituted ring, but in this case, the phenyl is attached to the acetone, so it's a substituent on the benzene. So the benzene has three substituents: the acetone group, a bromine, and a nitro group. Wait, no, the substituents are on the benzene ring attached to the acetone group. So the parent is the phenyl group attached to the acetone. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment (the acetone group is at position 1).

So the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions. Therefore, the ring has the acetone group at position 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5. Alternatively, it's 3-bromo-5-nitro attached to the acetone.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions to get there starting from benzene. The options are A to D, each with a series of steps.

I think about the possible reactions: nitration, bromination, acetylation (like using CH3COCl with AlCl3 as catalyst), reduction, diazotization, and other substitutions.

Wait, but the target has a nitro group and a bromine on the benzene ring. The acetone group is a ketone, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So when substituents are added, their positions depend on the directing effects of the existing substituents.

So the synthesis steps would involve adding substituents in a way that each step directs the next group to the correct position.

Let me think. Starting with benzene, the first reaction would likely be nitration because nitro groups are strong meta directors. But wait, another possibility is that the first substituent could be an acetyl group, which is an activating group (ortho/para director), but once it's attached, subsequent nitration would occur according to its directing.

Wait no, benzophenone derivatives are usually synthesized via Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation with an acyl chloride like CH3COCl in the presence of AlCl3. So the first step could be adding the acetyl group.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the order. Once the acetyl group is attached, the ring becomes activated for electrophilic substitution, but the acetyl group is a meta director, right? Or is it ortho/para? Wait, no. The acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing group by the inductive effect, which makes it a meta director.

So if we first acetylate benzene, the acetyl group is at position 1. Then, when we nitrate, the nitro group would go in the meta position relative to the acetyl group.

Wait, but then if we're adding two substituents, the nitro and the bromine, their positions would be determined by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the bromine and then the acetyl group. Let me think about that.

Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director. Then, bromination with FeBr3 would add bromine in the meta position relative to nitro. So nitro at position 1, bromine at 3. Then, when adding the acetyl group, where would it go? The acetyl group is a strong activating group? No, wait, CH3COCl would acetylate via Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. But the ring has nitro and bromine, which are deactivating. So Friedel-Crafts acylation may not proceed on such deactivated rings.

Wait, that's a problem. So if the ring has nitro and bromine groups, perhaps it's too deactivated for Friedel-Crafts. So maybe the acetyl group should be added earlier, before nitration.

So let's consider the order.

Option: Acetylate first, then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, but let's think. If we start with benzene and acetylate it, we get acetophenone. Then, nitrate. Where would the nitro group go? Since the acetyl group is a meta director, the nitro group would go meta to it, so position 3. Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Then, when adding bromine, using FeBr3 as catalyst, which is a bromination. The ring now has two substituents: acetyl (meta) and nitro (also meta). Wait, but the acetyl is a meta director, and the nitro is also a meta director. So when adding bromine, where would it
