Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think this through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities, right? Because when objects are moving close to the speed of light, you can't just use the classical velocity addition. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula.

The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, wait. Wait, the direction matters. Since both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference in their speeds, but adjusted for relativity. So u is the speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first, or the other way around? Hmm, perhaps I should get this straight.

Wait, the problem says they are moving in the positive x-direction, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So their speeds are in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is the speed of B? Or is it from the perspective of someone else? No, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. So astronaut A sees astronaut B moving at what speed?

Wait, I think the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction (along x-axis) is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u is the speed of one object in the other's frame. Alternatively, perhaps it's (v - u)/(1 - (vu/c²)) when considering the frame of the faster object.

Wait, let me think. Suppose I'm in the frame of astronaut A, who is moving at 0.6c. Then the speed of astronaut B, moving at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) ?

Wait that gives a negative value, which doesn
