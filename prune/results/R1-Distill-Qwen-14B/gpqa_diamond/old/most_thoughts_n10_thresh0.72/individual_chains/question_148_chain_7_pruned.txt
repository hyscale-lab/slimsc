Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. Hmm, binary compounds mean they consist of two elements, so Y and F. So Y is some element that forms five different compounds with fluorine. That makes me think of elements like oxygen or maybe something else, but let's keep going.

The compounds are referred to as A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. The problem gives some properties of these compounds, and I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me read the details again.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20Â°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction would produce fluorine gas. The oF (presumably the oxidation state) of A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oxidation state is a number, so maybe 31.96% is the percentage by mass, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps it's the oxidation number of fluorine. Oh wait, fluorine usually has an oxidation state of -1. Hmm, but 31.96% must be something else. Maybe the oF is the oxidation state of Y? Wait, maybe oF is the oxygen-freezing point or something else, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's the oxidation state of Y in A2? Because fluorine's oxidation state is usually -1, so perhaps in A2, Y's oxidation state is something else.

Wait, perhaps oF is the oxidation number of fluorine in that compound. But fluorine is usually -1. So if A2 has oF=31.96%, that might not make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding; perhaps oF is the oxidation state of Y. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe oF is the oxygen of fluorine? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe oF is the oxidation state of the fluorine in that compound. For instance, in some compounds, fluorine can have
