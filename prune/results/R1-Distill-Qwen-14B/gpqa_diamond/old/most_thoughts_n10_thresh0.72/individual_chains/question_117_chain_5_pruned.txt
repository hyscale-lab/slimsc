Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about isomers and optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives four compounds and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. The choices are A through D, each listing different numbers.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to enantiomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These enantiomers can rotate plane-polarized light, hence the name optical isomers. So, the key here is to find out which of these compounds have chiral centers.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Hmm, the name is a bit complicated. Let me try to visualize the structure. It's a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). The substituents: at position 2 on each ring, there's a carboxylate group (as it's the dicarboxylate). Additionally, each ring has a nitro group at position 6. Wait, but wait, in biphenyls, the positions are a bit tricky. Oh wait, the numbering is 6,6' which suggests that each ring has a nitro group at the 6 position. The main chain is the biphenyl, so the substituents are on the benzene rings.

Wait, but the question is about whether it has a chiral center. So, does this structure have any chiral centers? Well, each benzene ring is planar and symmetrical. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, but the way the rings are connected could allow for some symmetry.

Wait, let me think. The compound is 6,6'-dinitro. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6. The 2,2' positions have the carboxylate groups. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. But each ring is a benzene connected to the other. Now, the arrangement of substituents: if the substit
