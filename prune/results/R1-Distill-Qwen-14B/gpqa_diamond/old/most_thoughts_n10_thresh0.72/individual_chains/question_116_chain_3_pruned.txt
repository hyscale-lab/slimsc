Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum. The NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that the number of protons and their splitting can indicate certain structures. 

Let me think about what each signal could mean. A triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm is probably a methyl group (CH3) attached to something that splits it into a triplet. The integration of 6H suggests two methyl groups each with 3H. A quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H... wait, 4Hâ€”could that be a CH2CH2 group? Or maybe it's a -CH2CH2- structure. Quartet implies coupling with three neighboring protons. Wait, or maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Because if you have a CH2 next to another CH2, the first CH2 would split into a quartet. Let me think: if two CH2 groups are adjacent, the neighboring protons would cause splitting. So for each CH2, the neighboring group has 2H, so the splitting would be a triplet. Wait, no. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about ethyl groups. An ethyl group in an ethyl ester or something. The CH3CH2- group. The CH3 would be a triplet because it's next to a CH2 (which has 2H), so the splitting would be a triplet. But in the NMR here, the triplet is for 6H, which would be two sets of CH3 groups. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted ethyl group. Like, something like (CH2CH3)2O or something. Or perhaps a cyclopropane? No, maybe not. Alternatively, think of neopentyl groups or something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the quartet at 1.3 ppm is from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Let's say it's a -CH2CH2- group. The quartet would imply each of the CH2 protons is split by two neighboring protons. Wait, but each CH2 would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps it's a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. But wait, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H could be the CH2CH3 group. Wait, let's think: if you have a CH2CH3 group, the CH3 would be a triplet (as it's adjacent to the CH2), and the CH2 would be a quartet. Because each proton on the CH2 is next to three others? Wait, no. Wait, the splitting depends on the number of neighboring protons. For a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, each of the protons on the first CH2 would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each would have a triplet. But wait,
