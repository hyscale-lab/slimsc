Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has two separate reactions, and I need to figure out the major products A and B from each. Then, I'll match them with the given options. Let's tackle them one by one.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH (Potassium Hydride), and then H+ to give product A.

Hmm, spiro compounds can be a bit tricky. The structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol must be a spiro system where two rings are connected by a single atom. Let me visualize it. The spiro is [3.5], so one ring is a 3-membered and the other a 5-membered? Wait, no, spiro compounds have two rings connected at a single atom. So spiro[3.5] would mean one ring is 3 carbons (including the spiro atom) and the other 5. So the structure would have a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring attached at a single carbon. And there's a vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-) attached to that spiro carbon. Also, there's a double bond at position 5 in the non-enol. Wait, the name is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the main chain is non, which is 9 carbons? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Spiro compounds are named with the total number of carbons in the two rings, I think. So non is nine, but split into 3 and 5. So it's spiro with one ring of 3 and another of 5, making 8 carbons in total? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating that. Alternatively, the structure is a spiro system with a 5-membered ring and a 3-membered ring attached at the same carbon. So the 1-vinylspiro would have a vinyl group attached to the spiro carbon.

Now, the reaction conditions: THF is the solvent, which is a common one for such reactions. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. Then H+ is added. I'm thinking this is a deprotonation followed by some kind of acid work-up.

Looking at the starting material, it's an alcohol (spiro compound with an -ol group). When you have an alcohol and a strong base like KH, it's likely that the alcohol is deprotonated to form an alkoxide. But wait, in THF, a strong base like KH can also abstract protons. So maybe this is an elimination reaction? Because after deprotonation, if there's a good leaving group, it could form a double bond.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-vinylspiro... with an alcohol group. So the structure is a spiro system with a vinyl group and an alcohol. Let me think about possible mechanisms. Deprotonation could lead to an E1 or E2 elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or some kind of ring-opening.

Another thought: spiro systems can sometimes undergo ring-opening upon treatment with strong bases. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the THF is coordinating with the potassium, making a good environment for elimination.

Wait, I remember that when you have a cyclic ether or a ring system with an alcohol, deprotonation can lead to ring-opening if possible. But in this case, the spiro system is connected with a double bond (vinyl group) and an alcohol.

Wait, wait. Let's consider the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The spiro is at position 1, and the vinyl group is also at position 1. So the structure would have a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected at C1. The double bond is at position 5 in the non-enol... Hmm. So perhaps the spiro system has some conjugated double bonds.

When you treat this with a strong base like KH, which is a deprotonating agent, what's the acidic proton here? The alcohol has an -OH group, which is acidic but not extremely. But in the presence of a strong base like KH (which is a strong base, maybe stronger than, say, NaOH), the alcohol could be deprotonated to form an alkoxide.

Once deprotonated, what happens next? If there's a neighboring group that can leave, you might get an elimination. But in this case, the structure is a spiro system with a vinyl group. Alternatively, the deprotonation could lead to a conjugate elimination, forming a more stable carbocation or a more stable alkene.

Wait, another possibility is that the alkoxide could attack a double bond, leading to a ring-opening or a rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: think about the products given in the options. Looking at option A for product A, it's (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one. So that's a bicyclic structure with a ketone. How would that form from the starting material?

Bicyclo compounds are formed via ring-closing reactions. Maybe the starting spiro compound undergoes some kind of cyclization upon deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, the starting material is a spiro system with a five-membered ring and a three-membered ring. If the base abstracts a proton, perhaps from a position that's part of a ring, leading to a conjugate elimination that forms a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to the formation of a diradical or some sort of ring expansion. But I'm not too sure.

Another thought: When a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, it can undergo an elimination reaction to form a ketone. For example, in some cases, the base deprotonates the alcohol, which leaves, and a neighboring group (like a double bond) might form a carbocation, but that's not always the case. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces an elimination to form a ketone via an E2-like mechanism.

Wait, if the starting material
