Okay, I need to figure out the possible decay channels for this boson X. The question gives that X has a mass of 6 GeV. The Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not sure how that directly impacts the decay modes. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, any decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because when a particle decays, the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. And since this is lowest order, we're probably looking at two-body decays.

Looking at the fermions that X can interact with. The Lagrangian term is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)( υ + X(y) ) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so X is interacting with fermions. Wait, the way it's written, I think X is a scalar field because it's just X(y), not like a vector field with indices. So X is a boson, possibly a scalar.

The interaction term suggests that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay products would be a fermion and an antifermion. So X can decay into ff̄, where f is a fermion.

Now, the possible fermions that X can decay into depend on which fermions are in the theory. The problem doesn't specify, but I can think about the standard model fermions. So which fermions have masses below 3 GeV because, for a two-body decay, each particle must be less than half of X's mass. Since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Wait, but actually, the rest mass of the fermions must be less than or equal to X's mass, but since it's a decay into two particles, each must be less than X's mass. Wait, no, more accurately, the sum of the masses must be less than X's mass. But for a two-body decay, the maximum mass each can have is when the other is at rest, but in reality, for pair production, each must be less than X's mass. Wait, actually, for a fermion-antifermion pair, each individual particle must have a mass less than or equal to X's mass. Because you can't have a particle with mass higher than the parent in a decay.

Wait, no. The sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the parent. So for a two-body decay into two particles, each of their rest masses can be up to the parent's mass, but in reality, because of energy and momentum considerations, each must be less than the parent's mass. But more precisely, the sum of the rest masses must be less than the parent's mass.

So for X → f f̄, the rest mass of f must be less than 6 GeV. But wait, each f has rest mass m, so 2m
