Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a matrix, and I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, from the options, I have to pick which statement is correct.

First, let me parse the information given. The operator Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I can write down matrix Ay as c times S.

Wait, but actually, since c is a scalar, Ay = c * S. So let me write out what S looks like. S is a 2x2 matrix with first row [0, -i], second row [i, 0]. So, S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay would be:
[ 0   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if the problem gives S as a 2x2 matrix, but in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, but here S might be similar to the Pauli Y matrix. Let me think—wait, the Pauli Y matrix is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]
Which is exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

But wait, in the problem statement, S is given as a 2x2 matrix with first row (0 -i) and second (i 0). So yes, that's sigma_y. So Ay is (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Wait, but the angular momentum operator is often written as A = ħ/2 * sigma, but wait, the usual intrinsic spin angular momentum S is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So for a spin-1/2 particle, like the muon, the spin angular momentum S would be (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but in this problem
