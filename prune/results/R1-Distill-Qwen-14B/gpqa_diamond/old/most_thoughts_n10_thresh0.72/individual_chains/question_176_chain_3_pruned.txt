Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me the state of a system at time t as the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, the way it's written, I think it's a 3x1 matrix because it's a column vector. So, the state vector is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, meaning their norm is 1.

So let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which means this vector isn't normalized. So I think I need to normalize it before proceeding. Because when we do measurements, the probabilities depend on the normalized state. So the normalized state vector ψ would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. So ψ = (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1)^T.

Next, the problem mentions two observables, P and Q, with their respective matrix operators. So first, operator P's matrix is given. Let me write that out.

P is a 3x3 matrix where:
- First row is [0, 1/√2, 0]
- Second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
- Third row is [0, 1/√2, 0]

And operator Q is another 3x3 matrix:
- First row [1, 0, 0]
- Second row [0, 0, 0]
- Third row [0, 0, -1]

So I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, and then -1 when measuring Q after that. Since these are measurements of observables, which are Hermitian operators, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operators.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Hmm. Oh, but wait, the way measurements work is that when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So if we first measure P, then the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured value. Then, measuring Q after that would be in this new state.

But the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the process is:

1. Measure P. What's the probability of getting 0?
2. Then, in the state resulting from that measurement (so an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0), measure Q. What's the probability of getting -1 in that situation?

Then, the total probability is the product of these two probabilities, because both must occur in sequence.

Wait, no. No, actually, the first measurement (P) must yield 0, and then the second measurement (Q) must yield -1 in that new state. So the total probability is the probability of first getting 0 in P, multiplied by the probability of then getting -1 in Q.

So first, I'll compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P to find the possible outcomes and the corresponding states.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the possible eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them. Let me think.

Alternatively, since P is a 3x3 matrix, perhaps I can find its eigenvalues. Let's compute the characteristic equation for P.

The matrix P is:

[0      1/√2    0 ]
[1/√2   0      1/√2]
[0      1/√2    0 ]

Hmm, that looks symmetric, so it's a Hermitian matrix, as expected for an observable.
