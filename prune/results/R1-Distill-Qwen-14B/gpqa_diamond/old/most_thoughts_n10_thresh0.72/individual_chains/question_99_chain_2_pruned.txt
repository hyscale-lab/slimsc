Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be some sort of substituted carboxylic acids. Let me jot down the key information.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since it's a carboxylic acid, the broad peak is likely due to the -OH group in the carboxylic acid. That makes sense because carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches which are usually broad and around that region.

Then, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a key carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl, so that fits. The 1700 peak could also be from an ester or ketone, but considering the presence of the OH, it's probably a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds, or any vinylic protons. That's an important clue. So the structure doesn't have any double bonds with protons attached.

Looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group. The other parts vary. Let me check each structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is probably something like (CH2CH3)2C-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, let me draw it. The molecule is CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each attached to ethyl groups. So maybe it's (CH2CH3)2C-CH2-COOH. Wait, actually, the central carbons are each CH with ethyl substituents.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH2–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–COOH. Wait, no, the first part is CH3CH2, then a carbon attached to H and C2H5, then another carbon attached to H and C2H5, then COOH. So it's like (CH2CH3)2C–C(H)(C2H5)–COOH? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think, maybe it's CH2CH2 group attached to a geminal diethyl group, leading to another geminal diethyl group before the COOH.

Hmm, maybe it's more like (
