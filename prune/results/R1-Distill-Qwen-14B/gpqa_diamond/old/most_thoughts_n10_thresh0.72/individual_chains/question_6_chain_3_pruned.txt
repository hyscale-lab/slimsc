Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a quantum mechanical particle in two dimensions. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. And I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided. Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, the potential can sometimes be separable, which would help in solving the Schrödinger equation.

Wait, let me think. The potential has two terms: one is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in radial direction. The other term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's compute that. 

Calculating each part: (3/2)*(1/2) = 3/4, so the second term is (3/4)k r²(1 + cos2θ). So the whole V becomes (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Wait, adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recheck. Oh right, the original potential is (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. When I expand cos²θ into (1 + cos2θ)/2, then (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 would be (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So yes, that's correct. So the potential is (1/2 + 3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Wait, 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 +3/4 is 5
