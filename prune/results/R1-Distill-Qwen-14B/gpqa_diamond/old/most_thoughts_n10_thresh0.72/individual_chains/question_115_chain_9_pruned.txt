Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and take notes.

So, the setup is about an electron and a positron colliding. Both are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Their Lorentz factors are 4 and 2, respectively. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron have opposite charges, their annihilation usually emits gamma rays. But here, it's two photons, which makes sense because conservation laws must be satisfied.

Wait, the thing is, the electron and positron are moving with different speeds. Their Lorentz factors are given. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass dilate. Gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.

I think I need to calculate their velocities. But wait, maybe I don't need the velocities directly. Because in relativity, momentum is gamma*m*v. Since the positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, their masses are the same, right? So, m_e for both.

Wait, but positron and electron have the same mass but opposite charges. So, in terms of momentum, the positron is moving to the left, perhaps? Or wait, the positron is moving from the right. So, the electron is moving to the right (from left to right), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's moving from right to left). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

So, let's model this. Let's take a coordinate system where the positive x-axis is to the right. So, the electron is moving along +x, and the positron is moving along -x.

Wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, that would be the same direction as the electron? Or opposite? Wait, if the electron is moving from the left (so east, say) along the horizontal axis, and the positron is moving from the right
