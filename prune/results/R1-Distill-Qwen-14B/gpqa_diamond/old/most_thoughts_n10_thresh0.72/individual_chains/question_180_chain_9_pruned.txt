Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking. 

So, there's this isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, just the potential energy from their charges. 

Wait, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm. So, point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. 

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. Right, in such systems, the potential energy is typically the electrostatic potential energy between the charges. Since all the charges are the same, they will either all be positive or all negative. But since the problem says each has charge 2e, and e is the elementary charge (1.6e-19 C), each charge is 3.2e-19 C. So, same sign, so they'll repel each other. 

Wait, but the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are each 2 m away. So, the 12 charges are each 2 m from P. So, the system's potential energy comes from two contributions: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the other 12, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves. 

Wait, but if all the 12 are constrained at 2 m from P, how are they arranged? Are they all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m centered at P? That makes sense, because that's the natural configuration when particles are constrained to a fixed distance from a central point. So, for the 12 charges, each is on the sphere's surface, 2 m from P, and the 13th is at the center.

So, let's break down the potential energy. There are two parts: the potential energy due to the central charge (13th) and each of the 12, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges, since they are all at 2 m from P but what about their distances from each other?

Wait,
