Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Let me break down each step to figure out what each product is.

First step: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When a ketone reacts with bromine (Br2), I remember that it can undergo a couple of reactions. One possibility is the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have an alpha hydrogen, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone does have alpha hydrogens. Wait, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. In cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, so the adjacent carbons have two hydrogens each. So, if Br2 is added, under certain conditions, maybe it's a ketone bromination. If it's in a non-polar solvent, maybe it's addition? Or in a more polar solvent, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, another thought: bromine can add to conjugated dienes, but cyclohexanone doesn't have double bonds except the carbonyl. Oh wait, wait, another possibility: the bromine could be adding to the carbonyl group, making a bromide. So, cyclohexanone plus Br2 might form a di-substituted bromide? Or maybe it's more about the formation of a bromohydrin? No, wait, that's when water is present. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening if the ring is under strain, but cyclohexane is quite stable.

Wait, another approach. Let me think. Another possibility is that bromine adds to the double bond if there is one. Oh, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so the ring is a six-membered with one carbonyl. So, it's a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. Wait, no, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group, so the ring is saturated except for the carbonyl. So maybe the bromine is adding to the carbonyl? So, the ketone would react with Br2. I think the reaction
