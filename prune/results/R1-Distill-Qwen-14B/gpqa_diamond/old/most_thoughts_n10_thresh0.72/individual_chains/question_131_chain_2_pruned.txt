Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. Dicarboxylic acid means it has two carboxylic acid groups, right? And the cis-alkene part probably means that the double bond has the same groups on either side, like both substituents are on the same side.

Then, this acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride, which is like linking the two acid groups through a loss of water. So, the structure would have two carboxylic acid groups connected by an oxygen bridge, I think. Like, maybe something like HOOC-(something)-COOH, but after dehydration, it becomes (something) with an O connecting the two CO groups.

The problem says the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR. That's pretty upfield for a proton. Wait, no, wait. 7 ppm is actually around where you might see a proton next to an oxygen or something. But wait, the anhydride's structure—maybe there are protons that are equivalent. Since the NMR shows a single peak, that suggests all the protons in that region are equivalent. So perhaps it's a CH2 group or something. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a symmetrical structure. Because the starting material is a cis-alkene, when it dehydrates, the resulting anhydride might have a bridge structure, making the protons around it equivalent.

The 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Hmm, 137 is in the range of a carbonyl, maybe? Wait, no, carbonyls are usually higher. Wait, 165 is more like a carbonyl carbon—like a ketone or ester. Oh wait, in anhydrides, the carbonyl carbons are around 170-185 ppm. But wait, maybe the 165 is an
