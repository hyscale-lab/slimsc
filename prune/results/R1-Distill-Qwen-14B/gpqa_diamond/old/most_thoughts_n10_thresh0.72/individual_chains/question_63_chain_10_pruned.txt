Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy when the photon is absorbed. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the steps.

First, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions occur between energy levels. Since the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state. But wait, what's the next state with the lowest energy? I think in such models, transitions can be either electronic, vibrational, or rotational. But since the question is about a photon causing a transition, probably it's a vibrational transition, because rotational transitions typically require lower energy photons for certain selection rules. Or is it?

Wait, the rotational transitions usually require photon energy that corresponds to the energy difference between rotational levels. But the question is about the next state, which might involve the next vibrational state. Because in the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + ½) ħω, where n is 0,1,2,... So the fundamental state is n=0, and the first excited state is n=1. The energy difference between these would be ħω.

Wait, but the molecule is a diatomic undergoing rotation and vibration. So maybe the model combines both. But I think that in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational energy is considered along with rotational. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the photon's energy corresponds to the vibrational transition, because the rotational transitions might have much lower energy if the bond length isn't changing much.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a transition from the ground vibrational state to the next vibrational state (i.e., from n=0 to n=1), which would require a photon with energy equal to the difference between these levels.

Wait, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator are E_v = (v + ½) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum
