Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, photosphere is where the light comes from, and LTE is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the atoms behave as if they're in a thermal distribution.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but I don't think the actual value is needed for the equation. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

I remember that in LTE, the populations of energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given, so E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J. Let's say the excited level is i and the lower level is j. For star_1, the population is twice that of star_2. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", so I think it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state or another state.

But wait, the ratio is given as twice. So for star_1, (n_i)1 / (n_j)1 = 2 * (n_i)2 / (n_j)2. Because star_1 has twice as many in the excited state.

Wait, actually, the problem states that the excited level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio is 2:1. So (n_i)_1 / (n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i)_2 / (n_j)_2.

But using the Boltzmann equation for each:

(n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i / g_j)
