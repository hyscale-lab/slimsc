Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the molecular formula of the compound is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, and O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be four rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring and a double bond plus an amine or something else.

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm is a triplet for 1H. That's a strong singlet, maybe an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. So the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. But wait, in an aldehyde, the proton is usually at the end, so maybe that's not it. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, like a phenol, but that's usually lower, around 5-7 ppm. Or maybe an amine? But amines are around 1-5 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to some substituents that cause splitting.

Wait, perhaps it's a triplet because it's next to a CH2 group. So maybe it's a propenal group, like CH2-CH2-CHO? No, I'm not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe a vinyl group adjacent to the aldehyde. Wait, the triplet in the NMRâ€”could it be a proton that's next to two other protons? Like in a CH2 group, but that's usually a quartet. Maybe it's a CH with two adjacent groups. Hmm.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's in the aromatic region. Then 6.51 is another doublet
