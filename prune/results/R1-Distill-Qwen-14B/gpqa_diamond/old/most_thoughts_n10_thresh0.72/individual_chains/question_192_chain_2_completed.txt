Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

The setup is a bit involved. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and it's smaller than R, so the conductor is surrounding it.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, and a distance l from the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which means point P is definitely outside the conductor, not in some strange edge case.

The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, I'm trying to visualize this. So the setup is such that the conductor's center and the cavity's center are separated by s, and point P is at a position where the line from the cavity's center makes an angle theta with the line connecting the two centers.

Wait, no, the angle between l and s. Oh, I think l is the vector from the cavity's center to point P, and s is the vector from the conductor's center to the cavity's center. So the two vectors s and l form an angle theta.

Now, the options are various expressions for E. I remember that for conducting shells, charges reside on the outer surfaces. But there's a cavity here with a charge inside.

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. When you place a charge inside the cavity, how does the conductor respond? I think the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge, but since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface adjusts accordingly.

Wait, no, the conductor is neutral. When you have a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to the placed charge, and the outer surface will have the same as the placed charge because the conductor as a whole remains neutral. Or wait, no, the conductor is uncharged, so the inner cavity's +q would induce a -q on the inner surface, and then the outer surface would have +q to balance, because the total conductor's charge is zero. Or is that correct?

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q on it. Because the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor neutral again.

Oh right, because the conductor was neutral to begin with. So the net charge on the conductor is zero, so the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q (from the induced charges), leaving the conductor as a whole neutral.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged. So when you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q induced, and the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor's net charge zero. Because the conductor's own charge is zero, but the system as a whole (conductor plus the charge inside) would have +q. But no, the conductor is just the conductor. So the conductor's inner surface has -q (because of the charge inside the cavity), and the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero (since the conductor was uncharged). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor's initial charge is zero. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q because of the opposite charge inside. Now, the conductor's total charge is the sum of the charges on inner and outer surfaces. So if inner is -q, then outer must be +q to make the total zero. So yes, outer surface is +q.

Now, when considering the electric field outside the conductor (since point P is outside), the field should be the same as if all the charge on the conductor were concentrated at its center. Because, for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field outside would be as if a point charge +q is at the center of the conductor. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q, but the inner surface has -q. So in total, the conductor's net charge is zero? No, the conductor's net charge is the sum of inner and outer: (-q) + (+q)=0. So the conductor remains neutral. But when you have a charge inside the cavity, it's the outer surface that has a net charge, which in this case is +q.

Wait, no, the conductor's own charge is zero. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity) will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q. Because the total conductor must remain neutral, so the inner surface's -q and the outer's +q balance, making the conductor's net charge zero.

But wait, that's not correct because the conductor is a neutral uncharged object. So the charge inside the cavity is +q, which induces a -q on the inner surface, and since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's net charge is zero, but the outer surface has +q.

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface's charge, which behaves as if it's a point charge at the center. So the field at point P would be as if a +q charge is at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the charge is inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface is +q. So from outside, the field is solely due to this +q at the center.

Wait, but point P is located outside the conductor. So the field at P due to the conductor's outer surface would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

In this case, Q_enclosed is +q, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So is the answer B? But let me think again.

Wait, but the position of the charge inside the cavity might affect the induced charges. Oh, but in a conductor, the charges rearrange themselves to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the field inside the conductor is zero. But the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the induced charges on the inner surface, but the outer surface's charge distribution depends only on the total charge on the conductor, which for the outer surface is +q, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So the inner surface gets -q, the outer surface gets +q. The outer surface's charge distribution is uniform if the conductor is a perfect sphere, but if the cavity is off-center, does that change the distribution on the outer surface?

Wait, for a spherical conductor, the charge on the outer surface would still distribute uniformly, regardless of the position of the internal charge. Because the conductor is spherical and symmetric. So the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, and the field outside is as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

So the electric field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², since L is the distance from the center of the conductor (which is where the effective charge is) to point P.

So, looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the conductor is spherical, and the cavity is also spherical but shifted by distance s. So the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center.

Does the position of the cavity's center (i.e., the displacement s) affect the electric field outside the conductor? Because in a spherical conductor, the outer surface's charges are uniform regardless of s, because the conductor's material is a sphere, so the displacement s might affect the inner surface's charge distribution but not the outer.

Hmm, for example, if the cavity is a different shape, say a cube, then the external field would be more complicated. But since the cavity is a sphere and the conductor is a sphere, perhaps the outer charge distribution remains uniform.

Wait, but the problem's setup might complicate things. The point P is located at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the displacement s is between the conductor's and cavity's centers. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, but if the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, the field outside would be as if all the charge is at the center. So the position of point P relative to the cavity's center might not matter, because the field outside depends only on the distance L from the conductor's center.

Wait, but in that case, the answer is option B, regardless of the position of P relative to the cavity's position. Because the conductor's outer surface has a uniform distribution, and the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

So the other options involve l, s, and theta, which would come into play if the field depended on the position of the charge within the cavity. But in reality, the field outside is determined by the conductor's outer charge, which is uniformly distributed, leading to a field dependent only on L.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the method of images or how charges distribute.

In the conductor, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. The outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the +q is at the center.

So, the field at point P, which is at a distance L from the center, is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

So looking back at the options, option B is exactly that. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but why are there other options involving l, s, and theta? For example, option A: 1/(l - s cosθ)^2. That would imply the field depends on the displacement of the cavity and the angle, which doesn't make sense if the outer surface is uniformly charged.

So, I think the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

To analyze the situation:

1. **Induced Charges on the Conductor**:  
   When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   Outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ depends only on the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

3. **Irrelevance of $l$, $s$, and $\theta$**:  
   The position of the charge inside the cavity (i.e., the displacement $s$ and the angle $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution due to its spherical symmetry, and the field outside depends solely on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: This expression depends on $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor is independent of these parameters.  
   - **Option B**: This matches the expected result, as the electric field outside the conductor is given by $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$, which depends only on $L$.  
   - **Option C**: Similar to Option A, this depends on $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which is incorrect.  
   - **Option D**: This expression assumes the field depends only on $l$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on $L$, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

Answer: B
