Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be dilated due to special relativity. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer because of time dilation. So the formula should involve the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) which is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy.

Right, gamma is equal to E / (m c²), but since energy and mass are given in compatible units (GeV), maybe the c² factors will cancel out. So gamma here would be 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV, which is approximately 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, so 27 is about 3.41 * 7.91. So gamma is roughly 7.91.

Wait, but wait. Because the mass is 3.41 GeV/c² and energy is 27 GeV, so E = gamma m c². So gamma = E / (m c²) → but since both are in GeV, the c² can be considered as 1 when using these units. So yeah, gamma is 27 / 3.41 = approximately 7.915.

So the dilated lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = gamma * τ₀ = 7.915 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.915 * 8 is about 63.32, so τ ≈ 63.32e-16 s, which is 6.332e-15 seconds. Wait, no, 63.32e-
