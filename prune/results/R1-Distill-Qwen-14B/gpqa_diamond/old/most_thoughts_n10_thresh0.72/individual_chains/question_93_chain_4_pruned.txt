Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let's see, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples with technical replicates. The efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that a slope in qPCR calibration curves relates to the efficiency. The formula I think is slope = log(e) where e is efficiency. Since efficiency here is 100%, e is 1, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Efficiency is usually calculated as 100% meaning each cycle doubles the target. So log base 10 of 2 is approximately 0.3. Oh wait, but wait, the calculation for the slope in the standard curve is based on log10 of the efficiency. So if efficiency is 100%, that's 2, because each cycle doubles. So log10(2) is about 0.3. So the slope should be around -3.3? Because I think the formula is slope = ln(1/E)/ln(10), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, another approach. The standard curve in qPCR is usually y = mx + b, where y is Ct and x is log of the starting quantity. So the slope m is -log10(e), where e is efficiency. If efficiency is 100%, e is 100% = 1, so e =1? Wait no, efficiency is usually expressed as a decimal. So 100% efficiency would be e=1. So if the efficiency is 100%, then log10(e) is zero, but that can't be right because the slope is -3.3 here. Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, the slope is usually calculated as (ln(1/e)) * log10(e). No, wait, maybe I should think of it as the formula for the slope in a standard curve. The standard curve uses the equation:

Ct = (1/slope) * log10(N0) + intercept

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The standard curve is based on the formula:

Ct = Ct0 + (1/slope) * log
