Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. I need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and a possible form of f.

So the options are A, B, C, D, each giving a fraction and a power dependence on λ.

Hmm. Okay, I recall that for dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle has a certain angular dependence. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is such that the intensity (power per unit area) varies with the angle. The intensity is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), I think. But wait, that's for the intensity, but in terms of power per unit solid angle, maybe it's the same.

Wait, the maximum power is given as A. So when is the power maximum? For a dipole, the maximum intensity occurs when the dipole is aligned with the direction of observation, which is θ=0. So for θ where cosθ=1, the intensity is maximum. So at θ=0, the power per unit solid angle is maximum. So for other angles, the power would be lower.

But the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees. So I need to find, I think, the ratio of the power at θ=30° to the maximum power A.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the function f(λ,θ) is the power per unit solid angle. So f is maximum when the angle θ is such that it's aligned with the dipole direction, which is θ=0. So the maximum A would be f evaluated at θ=0, perhaps.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is a function f, so f_max = A. So the question is, what's the value of f when θ=30 degrees, divided by f_max (A), so f(30)/A.

So
