Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused. Let's try to work through it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing product 1. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR. The options are various splitting patterns.

First, I'll think about each step.

Step 1: 1,3-Dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) heated to 240°C. KOH is a strong base. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have Brs on adjacent carbons in the structure. When dibromides are treated with strong bases like KOH, an elimination reaction is likely. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, perhaps it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—elimination would form an exo-methylene group, maybe? Or perhaps a diene? But since it's 1,3, elimination would form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-didehydroadamantane? Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or some other reaction, but that's less likely.

Wait, another thought: KOH could cause a double elimination, leading to the formation of an alkene. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. So elimination would lose HBr twice, forming a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,2-didehydro-1,3-adamantane? Or maybe 1,3-diene? Wait, no, the positions are 1 and 3, so elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 2 and 3? No, that doesn't make sense because 1,3 dibromine would be on adjacent carbons in a cyclo structure. Wait, adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So when treated with KOH, the elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. Wait, Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are not stable unless the bridge is at least three carbons long. Adamantane has two-carbon bridges, so maybe it's not possible, so maybe the elimination isn't possible here. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. Wait, but with KOH, what else can happen? Maybe a substitution? But with two bromines, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would form a diol. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. If it's a diol, would that be white or yellow? Alternatively, elimination could form a ketone, but that's not likely with KOH.

Wait, another possibility: the base could cause a Hofmann elimination. But that's usually for amines. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a strained ring.

Wait, maybe I should look at the product's NMR. The NMR of product 1 has signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). And IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. But wait, if product 1 is formed from KOH, perhaps it's a diol. Wait, but the IR at 1720 is more likely a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. Hmm, but diols don't have strong carbonyl peaks.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone. How? Maybe via a benzylic position. Oh, wait, if the bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, perhaps when KOH is added, it abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Let me think: when a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent halogens) is treated with a strong base, sometimes a carbonyl is formed via elimination of two equivalents of HX. So R-Br + R'-Br → upon elimination, R and R' are connected by a double bond, but that would require adjacent carbons. But in adamantane, maybe the structure allows the formation of a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe each Br leads to the formation of a ketone upon elimination.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to formation of a ketone on each bridgehead. But that would require each bridgehead having a Br and a hydrogen that can be abstracted. So perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and KOH abstracts a hydrogen adjacent, leading to the formation of two carbonyl groups. But that would make a diketone. But would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diketone? But I'm not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the base deprotonates, leading to the formation of an oxide, which then loses HBr to form a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol. But then why the IR at 1720?

Hmm
