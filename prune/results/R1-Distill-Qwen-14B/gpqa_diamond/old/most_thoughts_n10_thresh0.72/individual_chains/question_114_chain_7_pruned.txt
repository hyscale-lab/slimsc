Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents needed for the reactions given. Let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is like a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile like NaCN, I'm thinking maybe it's a nucleophilic addition reaction. Wait, but wait, ketones usually undergo nucleophilic addition with something like cyanide. Oh, right! The cyanide ion could act as a nucleophile here.

So, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, the product structure: the nitrile group is on the second carbon, and there's a hydroxyl group there too. So, maybe it's a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by something else.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the CN- adds to the carbonyl, making an addition product. But then, what happens next? Oh, wait, the product has both a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That makes me think of a hydroxy nitrile. How do we get that from a ketone and NaCN?

Wait, maybe it's an example of the Stephen reduction or some kind of nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a two-step process. Let me think. Another thought: Maybe the ketone is first converted to an acetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with HCN, it can form a cyanohydrin. Oh, right, that's a thing. A cyanohydrin is when the oxygen of the ketone is replaced by a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. So, the reaction of ketones with HCN forms cyanohydrins. So for that, the reagent would be HCN, but here the reagent is NaCN. Oh wait, but maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst.

So, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN and H+ (like H3O+) as a catalyst. Because HCN is a weak acid, maybe the reaction requires an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So, reagent A would be H3O+.

So, in that case, the first part would be A = H3O+.

Now, looking at the options, all the As are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So let's see which options have A as H3O+. Options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The product from the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, it reacts with reagent B in the presence of H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbut
