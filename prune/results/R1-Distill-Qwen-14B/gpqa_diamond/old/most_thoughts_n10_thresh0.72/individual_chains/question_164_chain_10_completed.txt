Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, okay, let's see what's going on. The question is about figuring out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh right, the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses. 

So the given data: both systems have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. Then, the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are given. System_1 has 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and system_2 has 15 and 10. 

I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity semi-amplitude relates to the mass of the companion. The formula I think is something like K = (v) = (2πG / (P * sqrt(1-e²))) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )) ), but wait, maybe I should think about the mass function here. Oh right, the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 (1-e²) ) ) = ( (K1)^3 P )/(2π G )}, but I'm getting a bit confused. 

Wait, but since both stars in each system are eclipsing binaries, their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination i is close to 90 degrees, which means sin i is approximately 1. So maybe I can ignore the inclination part since it's the same for both systems. 

Each system has two stars orbiting each other. In a spectroscopic binary, the RV semi-amplitude (K) of each star is inversely proportional to the mass of the other. Like, K1 is proportional to M2/(M1+M2) and K2 is proportional to M1/(M1+M2). Because the more massive star would move slower in the system, right? Because in a two-body system, the more massive star has a smaller orbit.

Wait, let me think. The two stars orbit their common center of mass. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are their respective orbital radii. And since velocity is proportional to (2π a)/P, their velocities would be proportional to a/(P), so K1 is proportional to a1, K2 proportional to a2. So K1 / K2 = (a1)/(a2) = (M2)/(M1) because M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So in system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 2. Which implies M2/M1 = 2, so M2 = 2 M1. So the masses are in a 2:1 ratio. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, in system_2, K1 is 15, K2 is 10. So K1/K2 = 1.5. So M2/M1 = 1.5, meaning M2 = 1.5 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait no, wait. Wait, system_1's stars have K1=10 and K2=5. So K1 is larger than K2, which means the star with K1 is less massive, because the more massive star moves slower. So K1 corresponds to M2, K2 to M1? Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight.

Let me denote for system_1: star A has velocity amplitude K_A = 10 km/s, star B has K_B = 5 km/s. 

In a binary system, the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if K_A is larger than K_B, then M_A must be smaller than M_B. So M_A < M_B. Because M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B, and velocity is proportional to a, so higher velocity means smaller mass. 

So in system_1, K_A =10, K_B=5. So M_A / M_B = (a_B / a_A) = (v_B / v_A) ) = (5/10) )= 0.5. So M_A = 0.5 M_B. So M_B = 2 M_A.

So the total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = 3 M_A.

Similarly, system_2: K_A=15, K_B=10. So K_A > K_B, which implies M_A < M_B. So M_A / M_B = (10/15) )= 2/3. So M_A = (2/3) M_B. So the total mass is M_A + M_B = (2/3 M_B) + M_B = (5/3) M_B.

Wait, but in system_2, which of the K's is which? Because in the problem statement, the RV amplitudes for system_2 are given as 15 and 10. So if star A is 15, star B is 10, then as before, their masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So M_A / M_B = 10/15 = 2/3. So M_A = (2/3) M_B.

Now, the question is about the mass of the entire system. So for system_1, the total mass is M1 = M_A + M_B = 3 M_A. For system_2, the total mass is M2 = M_A + M_B. Wait, but in system_2, M_A is (2/3) M_B. So M2 = (2/3 M_B) + M_B = (5/3) M_B. 

So now, we have to compare M1 and M2. But wait, M1 is expressed in terms of M_A, and M2 in terms of M_B. I need to relate these two. Because the problem is asking for the ratio of M1 to M2.

Wait, but how can I find M1 and M2 in terms of each other? Because we don't have more information. Hmm. Maybe I need to use the orbital period. The period is the same for both stars in a binary system, right? So the periods for system_1 and system_2 are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. 

The orbital period P is the same for both stars in a binary system. So perhaps the period can help relate the masses. Alternatively, maybe I can find the mass ratio and then see how the periods relate. But wait, the period is a function of the total mass and the separation. 

Wait, let's think about Kepler's third law. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) ) * a^3, where a is the semi-major axis. But in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass, so the separation between them is a = a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are their respective distances from the center. 

From earlier, M1 a1 = M2 a2, so a1/a2 = M2/M1. And a = a1 + a2 = a2 (M2/M1 +1). Hmm, but maybe it's better to express the period in terms of the masses and the velocities. 

Alternatively, I remember that the sum of the velocities is related to the orbital period. Well, velocity is 2π a / P. So for each star, v = 2π a_i / P. 

But for the two stars, v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P. And from earlier, a1/a2 = M2/M1. So v1/v2 = (a1)/(a2) ) = M2/M1. 

In system_1, K1 is 10 (v1) and K2 is 5 (v2). So v1 =10, v2=5. So v1/v2=2. Which equals M2/M1. So M2 = 2 M1. So total mass of system_1 is 3 M1.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So v1=15, v2=10. So v1/v2=1.5 = M2/M1 in system_2. So M2 = 1.5 M1. Wait, but wait, in system_2, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars, but in system_1, M1 is the mass of the star with K=5.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let's rephrase.

For system_1: let M1 be the mass of the star with K=5 (v=5), and M2 the mass with K=10 (v=10). Then, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2. The velocities are v1=5=2π a1 / P1, v2=10=2π a2 / P1. So v2 = 2 v1. So a2 = (v2 * P1)/(2π) = (2 v1 * P1)/(2 pi) )= ( v1 * P1 ) / pi. Similarly, a1 = (v1 * P1)/(2 pi). 

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the mass ratio.

In system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So the velocities are in a 2:1 ratio. So the mass ratio M1:M2 is inversely proportional, 1:2. So M1 = (1/3) M_total_1, M2 = (2/3) M_total_1.

Similarly, for system_2: K1=15, K2=10. So the velocities are 15 and 10, which have a ratio of 3:2. So the mass ratio is inversely 2:3. So M1 = (2/5) M_total_2, M2 = (3/5) M_total_2.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify.

In system_1: 
- Star A has velocity K_A =10, so it's less massive than Star B, which has K_B=5. Because the more massive star moves slower. So M_A is smaller than M_B.

So M_A : M_B = (v_B : v_A ) = (5 : 10 )= 1:2. So M_A= x, M_B=2x. So the total mass M1_total = x + 2x=3x.

In system_2:
- Star A has velocity K_A=15, Star B K_B=10. So M_A : M_B = (v_B : v_A )=10:15=2:3. So M_A=2y, M_B=3y. So M2_total =5y.

Now, the periods are 2 years and 1 year. How do the periods relate to the masses? 

I remember that the period is the same for both stars in a binary system. So the period is determined by the sum of the masses and the separation. But how can we relate the periods of the two systems?

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law. The formula for the period squared is proportional to (a^3)/(M_total), where a is the separation.

But in a binary system, the separation a is a1 +a2, where a1 is the orbit of star A around the center of mass, a2 for star B. So a1 = (M_B/(M_A + M_B )) * a, and a2 = (M_A/(M_A + M_B )) * a.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the period and the mass.

I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_companion sin i ) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, I came across the formula for the mass function, which is f(M) = (K1^3 P )/(2π G ), which gives part of the mass information, but I don't remember exactly.

Wait, another approach: the mass function for a binary system is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 - e^2) ) ) = ( (K1 P )/(2π ) )^3 / (G ), ignoring some constants.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio of the masses of the two systems.

Wait, let's think in terms of the total mass and the velocity amplitudes.

In each system, the two stars have velocities K1 and K2, and their masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So the mass ratio is K2/K1.

For system_1: K1=10, K2=5. So mass ratio M1:M2 =5:10=1:2. So M1=1 part, M2 =2 parts. Total M1_system =3 parts.

For system_2: K1=15, K2=10. So M1: M2=10:15=2:3. So M1=2 parts, M2=3 parts. Total M2_system=5 parts.

But how does the period come into play here? Because the periods are different (2 years and 1 year). So perhaps the actual masses are also influenced by the period.

Wait, the period P is the same for both stars in a binary. So for each system, the period is the same for both stars. But the periods of the two systems are different. So we can use Kepler's third law to relate the period and the mass.

Kepler's third law formula: P^2 = (4π² G )^(-1) * (a^3) / (M_total) }, but I'm not sure about the exact form. Wait, better to write the correct formula.

The correct form is P² = (4π² / G (M1 + M2)) ) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But a is the sum of a1 and a2, which are the individual orbits. 

Alternatively, since the two stars orbit their common center of mass, their individual orbits are a1 and a2, with a = a1 + a2. The velocity of each star is v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2=2π a2 / P.

But from the mass ratio, M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a2 = (M1/M2) a1.

So a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + M1/M2 ) = a1 ( (M2 + M1)/M2 ) → a1 = a M2/(M1 + M2).

Similarly, v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π (a M2/(M1 + M2)) ) / P.

But I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere. Maybe it's better to use the formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G ) / (P c ) )^(1/3) * (M_companion sin i ) / ( (M_total )^(2/3) ) )

But I'm not entirely confident about the constants. Let me see another approach. 

I think I can relate the mass function for each system. The mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1-e²) ) = ( (K1 P )^3 ) / (2π G (1 - e²) ) )

But since the systems are eclipsing, their eccentricity e is close to zero (e ~ 0), so 1 - e² ≈ 1. So we can ignore that term.

So for system_1:
f(M1) = ( (K1 P1 )^3 ) / (2 π G )

Similarly for system_2:
f(M2) = ( (K2 P2 )^3 ) / (2 π G )

Wait, no, for each system, each star's mass function is defined with the other star as the companion. So perhaps for system_1, star A has K1=10, and its mass function would be f(M1A) = ( (10 * 2 )^3 ) / (2 π G ), where P1 is 2 years. Similarly, star B's f(M1B) would be (5 * 2)^3 / (2 π G ).

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to express the mass of each system in terms of their velocities and periods.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the masses. Let me find the ratio of system_1's total mass to system_2's total mass.

In system_1, the mass ratio is M1:M2 =1:2 (from K1=10 and K2=5). So M1 = (1/3) M1_total, M2 = (2/3) M1_total.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So mass ratio M_A:M_B=10:15=2:3. So M_A= (2/5) M2_total, M_B=(3/5) M2_total.

But how do the periods come into play? Because the period of the orbit affects the actual masses. So I need to relate the periods to the actual masses.

Wait, using Kepler's law: P² = (4 π² a³)/( G (M1 + M2) )

But a is the separation between the two stars. Alternatively, a = a1 + a2, and since a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2) ) a.

Wait, but we can relate the velocity to the period. Kepler's law in terms of velocity is v = 2π a / P. So for each star, v = (2 π a_i ) / P.

But a_i is related to the mass. For example, a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, so v1 = 2 π a1 / P = 2 π (M2 a) / ( (M1+M2) P ).

Similarly, v2= 2 π a2 / P = 2 π (M1 a ) / ( (M1+M2) P )

So, combining these, v1 / v2 = M2 / M1.

Which makes sense because v is inversely proportional to mass.

But to relate this to the mass function, perhaps I can write the following: 

For system_1, K1 =10, K2=5.

So, v1=10, v2=5. So v1/v2 = 2 = M2/M1 → M2=2 M1.

Total mass M1_total =3 M1.

Similarly, system_2: K1=15, K2=10. v1=15, v2=10. v1/v2=1.5 = M2/M1 → M2=1.5 M1. So M2_total=2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, M1 and M2 are the masses of the stars, but the same M1 is the mass of a different star than in system_1. So perhaps I can't directly compare the M1 and M2 between the two systems. Hmm, maybe I should assign variables.

Let me define:

For system_1:

Star A mass: M_A1 = x, velocity K_A1=10.

Star B mass: M_B1 = y, velocity K_B1=5.

From the velocity ratio: y/x = K_A1/K_B1 = 10/5=2 → y=2x.

So M_total1 = x + y = x +2x=3x.

For system_2:

Star A mass: M_A2 = a, velocity K_A2=15.

Star B mass: M_B2 = b, velocity K_B2=10.

Velocity ratio: b/a = K_A2/K_B2 =15/10=1.5 → b=1.5 a.

So M_total2 = a +1.5 a=2.5 a.

Now, we need to find the ratio M_total1 / M_total2 = (3x) / (2.5 a) )= (6x)/(5a).

But how to relate x and a? We need another equation that relates the two systems.

Ah, the orbital period. The period is the same for both components in a binary. So for system_1, the period P1 is 2 years, and for system_2, P2 is 1 year.

The period is related to the masses and the separation. So using Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 π² a^3 )/( G (M_total) )

Wait, but a is the separation in each system, which is different. Hmm, but perhaps the velocity can help. Because velocity is v = 2 π a_i / P, and a_i is the radius of the orbit for each star.

Wait, another approach: the mass function f(M) is given by:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) ) / (2 π G )

But f(M) is (M_companion^3 sin^3 i )/( (M_total)^2 (1 -e²) )

Since both systems are eclipsing, i≈90°, so sin i≈1, and e≈0, so f(M) = (M_companion^3 )/( (M_total)^2 )

So, for system_1, star A has K=10, P=2 years.

f(M1A) = ( (10 )^3 * 2 ) / (2 π G )

But f(M1A) = ( M_B1^3 )/( (M1A + M_B1 )^2 )

Similarly, for system_2, star A has K=15, P=1.

f(M2A)= ( (15)^3 *1 )/(2 π G ) = (15^3 )/(2 π G )

And f(M2A)= ( M_B2^3 )/( (M_A2 + M_B2 )^2 )

So let's write these equations.

For system_1:

f1 = ( (10)^3 * 2 ) / (2 π G ) ) = ( M_B1^3 ) / ( (M1A + M_B1 )^2 )

We know from earlier that M_B1=2 M1A.

So substituting M_B1=2 M1A into f1:

f1= ( (2 M1A )^3 ) / ( (3 M1A )^2 ) ) = (8 M1A^3 )/(9 M1A^2 ) ) = (8/9) M1A.

So f1 = (8/9) M1A = (10^3 *2 )/(2 π G )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute f1.

f1 = ( (10)^3 * 2 )/( 2 π G ) ) = (1000 * 2 )/( 2 π G ) ) = (2000 )/( 2 π G ) )= 1000/( π G )

Similarly, from the mass function:

f1 = (M_B1^3 )/( (M1A + M_B1 )^2 ) 

But M_B1=2 M1A → f1 = (8 M1A^3 )/(9 M1A^2 ) ) = (8/9) M1A.

So,

8/9 M1A = 1000/( π G )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can find the ratio between the two systems.

I think I'll need to find M_total1 and M_total2 in terms of G and the other variables.

Wait, another approach: the mass function for both stars in the binary can be expressed in terms of their velocities and periods.

But perhaps a better way is to find the ratio M_total1 / M_total2.

Let me express f1 and f2 in terms of each system's parameters.

For system_1:

f1 = (K1^3 P1 )/(2 π G ) = (10^3 *2 )/(2 π G )= (2000)/(2 π G )= 1000/( π G )

And f1 = M_B1^3 / ( (M1A + M_B1 )^2 )

But M_B1=2 M1A, so substituting:

f1 = (8 M1A^3) / (9 M1A^2 ) ) = (8/9) M1A.

Set equal: (8/9) M1A = 1000/( π G )

Similarly, for system_2:

f2 = (K1^3 P2 )/(2 π G ) = (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G )= (3375 )/(2 π G )

f2 is also M_B2^3 / ( (M_A2 + M_B2 )^2 )

In system_2, M_B2=1.5 M_A2.

So f2 = ( (1.5 M_A2 )^3 ) / ( (2.5 M_A2 )^2 ) ) = (3.375 M_A2^3 ) / (6.25 M_A2^2 ) ) = (3.375 /6.25 ) M_A2 = 0.54 M_A2.

Set equal: 0.54 M_A2 = 3375/(2 π G )

Now, let me write the two equations:

1) (8/9) M1A = 1000/( π G )

2) 0.54 M_A2 = 3375/(2 π G )

We can express M1A and M_A2 in terms of G.

From equation 1:

M1A = [1000/( π G ) ] * (9/8 )

= (9000 ) / (8 π G )

= (1125 ) / ( π G )

From equation 2:

M_A2 = [ 3375/(2 π G ) ] / 0.54

= (3375 ) / (2 π G * 0.54 )

= 3375 / (1.08 π G )

= 33750 / (10.8 π G )

Wait, 0.54 * 6.25 = 3.375, but perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Alternatively, let's compute the ratio of M1A to M_A2.

M1A = (1000/( π G )) * (9/8 )

M_A2 = (3375/(2 π G )) / 0.54

So,

M1A = (9000)/(8 π G )

M_A2 = (3375 )/( 2 π G * 0.54 )

Simplify denominator: 2 *0.54=1.08.

So denominator is 1.08 π G.

So M_A2 = 3375 / (1.08 π G )

Now, the ratio M1A / M_A2 = [ (9000/(8 π G )) ] / [ (3375/(1.08 π G )) ) ]

= [9000/8 ] / [ 3375 / 1.08 ]

= (9000 * 1.08 ) / (8 * 3375 )

Let me compute that.

9000 * 1.08 = 9720.

8 * 3375 = 27000.

So ratio = 9720 / 27000 = 0.36.

So M1A = 0.36 M_A2.

Now, recall that in system_1, M_total1 =3 M1A.

In system_2, M_total2=2.5 M_A2.

So, the ratio M_total1 / M_total2 = (3 M1A ) / (2.5 M_A2 )

Since M1A =0.36 M_A2,

= [3 * 0.36 M_A2 ] / (2.5 M_A2 )

= (1.08 M_A2 ) / (2.5 M_A2 )

= 1.08 / 2.5 = 0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Wait, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Wait, no—wait, the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2.

Wait wait, no—no, no—wait, in the question, it's asked: by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

Wait, but according to this calculation, M_total1 / M_total2 = 0.432. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is more massive. So system_1 is less massive. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is less than 1. So system_1 is 0.4 times as massive.

Wait, but wait the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

So the correct answer is option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the ratio? Because if the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, then the factor is M1 / M2.

Wait, in my calculation, M1 is 0.4 * M2, so M1 is 0.4 times M2. So system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive, and the factor would be 0.4, but the question is phrased as "system_1 more massive than system_2"—so perhaps I have it reversed.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again.

"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

So if the factor is 0.4, that would mean system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. So the factor is less than 1, meaning system_1 is less massive.

Wait, but the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive"—so if the factor is 0.4, that would imply system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So it's 0.4 times, meaning system_1 is less massive. But the question phrasing is "more massive than"—so perhaps the correct answer is that system_1 is less massive, and the factor is 0.4, meaning system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2.

So the answer would be A) ~0.4.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation.

So the ratio M_total1 / M_total2 = 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. So the answer is A.


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data:

### Key Observations:

   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{2,1} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Mass ratio: \( M_{2,1} : M_{2,2} = K_{2,2} : K_{2,1} = 10 : 15 = 2 : 3 \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{2,1} + M_{2,2} = 2y + 3y = 5y \)

### Relating the Masses:
The total masses of the systems are proportional to \( M_{\text{total,1}} = 3x \) and \( M_{\text{total,2}} = 5y \). To find the ratio \( \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} \), we need to relate \( x \) and \( y \).

Using the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula and the orbital periods, the mass function for each system is proportional to \( \frac{K^3 P}{G} \). After equating and simplifying, the ratio of the total masses is found to be:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3x}{5y} = 0.4
\]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.4 times** as massive as system_2. Therefore, system_1 is **less massive** than system_2 by a factor of 0.4.
