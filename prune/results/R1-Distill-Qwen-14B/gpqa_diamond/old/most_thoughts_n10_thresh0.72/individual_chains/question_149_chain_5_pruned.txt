Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows duplicate peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. Also, coupling isn't the issue because the pattern rules that out. Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks with the same mass, same intensity. Both match the expected molecule.

Hmm. So what's happening here? Let me break down each part.

First, the NMR. Normally, each proton in a molecule gives a peak, but here there are two for the same alpha-proton. Since it's the same proton, why two peaks? The integral is 1H total, so it's not like it's splitting into two (like if it was a doublet). They have similar shifts, so maybe they're not from different protons. Also, coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't explain it. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, the same alpha-proton. Maybe there's some kind of diastereotopic situation? Or perhaps something to do with the structure causing the proton to have different environments in different molecules.

In a peptide, alpha-protons are adjacent to the amide group. If there's some kind of stereoisomerism, would that split the peak? Like, maybe if the molecule has a double bond or a chiral center elsewhere, causing the alpha proton to split. But the question says that the coupling isn't the issue, so maybe it's about something else.

Wait, but the NMR is from the crude compound. So if it's a mixture of something, maybe enantiomers or diastereomers. Let's think about that.

If the compound is a racemic mixture, meaning it has both enantiomers, then in the NMR, each enantiomer would have the same set of protons but in mirror image environments. But wait, in that case, wouldn't the NMR show the same peaks? Because enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. So if the mixture is enantiomers, wouldn't the NMR look the same as a pure sample? But here, there are two peaks for one proton. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, then their NMR spectra would be different. Because diastereomers have different physical properties. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would show peaks for the same proton, but perhaps in different environments. Wait, but if they are in a mixture, would you see separate peaks?

But wait, the problem states that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So perhaps each diastereomer has a different shift for that proton, leading to two separate peaks. But then why are the integrals equal? Because it's a 50-50 mixture. So the integral for each would be about 0.5H,
