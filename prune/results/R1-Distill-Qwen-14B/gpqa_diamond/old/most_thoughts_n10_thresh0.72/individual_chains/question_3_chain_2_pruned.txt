Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And we're told that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx, up to one decimal place. The options are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm. I remember that expectation values can be found by taking the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So, ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

Wait, but the operator here is 10σz +5σx. So maybe I can compute the expectation value for each part separately and then add them together. Because expectation values are linear, right? So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

That makes sense. So first I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check if this is a normalized state. The coefficients squared would be 0.25 and 3/4. Adding them gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good, no need to worry about normalization.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ should be straightforward. Because σz |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So ψ is a linear combination of these eigenstates, so when I apply σz, it'll just multiply each term by their respective eigenvalues.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that:

(0.5)^2 is 0.25. So 0.25 * 1 = 0.25.

(sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Add them together: 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now for σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Instead, the eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, but to compute ⟨σx⟩, maybe I can express σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ and compute the expectation directly. Because σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). So when I compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, it's the sum over the terms.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it by expanding the expectation value.

So ψ is a= 0.5 |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩, where b is sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|) σx (a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩ )

Expanding this, it's a* a ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|
