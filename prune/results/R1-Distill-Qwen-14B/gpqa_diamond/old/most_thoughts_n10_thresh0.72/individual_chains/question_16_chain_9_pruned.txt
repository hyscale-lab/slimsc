Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which requires at least one chiral center. But wait, there's more to itâ€”like, sometimes even if there's a chiral center, the molecule might not be chiral overall if there's a plane of symmetry or something.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   - Structure: The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl and a CH2CH3 group (since it's 2-methyl). Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on the first carbon and a methyl on the second. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl attached to a double bond. So the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (Z)-configuration. But wait, is there any possibility of chirality here? Let's see: Does the double bond have two different substituents on each carbon?

   Looking at the double bond (between C1 and C2). For C1: substituents are Cl and CH2. Wait, no, C1 is CH2Cl, but wait, but for the double bond, each carbon is connected to two groups. So for C1, it's attached to Cl and CH2CH2... wait, no. Let me think again. Maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on the first carbon. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Alternatively,
