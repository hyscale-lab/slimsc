Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says Compound X has certain IR and NMR data and reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, but I remember that usually, a peak around 3400 might indicate an -OH stretch, like in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but also, the 2500-3000 region might suggest C-H stretching from alkenes or maybe an amine, but I'm not sure. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Oh, but if there's a peak around 1700, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because they have a strong O-H stretch too, which is in the 3400 range. Also, the peak at 1610 could be a carbonyl in an aromatic ring, like a benzene ring with substituents. Wait, no, 1610 is more like the C=C stretching in an aromatic ring. Similarly, 1450 cm-1 is probably another aromatic ring vibration.

Now the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several signals. Starting from the highest ppm: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton, because they usually appear around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. So that makes me think that the compound has a -COOH group.

Looking at the other signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H and are around 8 and 7.2, which is typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. The 8.0 is probably the protons next to the substituent, maybe a strong electron-withdrawing group like a nitro or carbonyl. Wait, but in this case, the IR suggested a carbonyl group, so maybe it's a substituent like a carbonyl, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, in benzoic acid, the protons are usually deshielded. So if the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, the adjacent protons would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Let me think. For benzoic acid, the para-substituted protons are usually around 7.5-8 ppm. So that fits with the 8.0 and 7.2 peaks. So maybe the ring has a COOH group attached.

Then, looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). Hmm. Let's break that down. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something that's probably a CH2 group, like maybe a CH2CH2CH3 or similar. Wait, the triplet at 0.9 could be a terminal methyl of an ethyl group. Wait, but the triplet is from coupling with two protons, so perhaps a -CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, a triplet at terminal would be if the adjacent group is a CH2, so like CH2CH3. But let me think again.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating for 2H. If we have a group like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), maybe. Or perhaps a -CH2-CH2- structure. Let me see: the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a methine (CH) group attached to something else, perhaps a branching point. The 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. Because a doublet would imply coupling with one neighboring proton, so maybe a structure like CH(CH2CH3)2? Or perhaps CH(CH3)2?

Wait, putting it all together. Let's try to imagine the structure. The benzene ring is para-substituted, with the substituent being a carboxylic acid group (because of the IR and NMR). Then, attached to the ring is another group. Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to some branching. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups, and the 1.4 (d,3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH, which is itself attached to something else. The 0.9 (t,3H) is a terminal methyl, probably from an ethyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group at the para position, and an ethyl group attached to another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent with a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the red phosphorus and HI reaction is likely a substitution reaction. Red phosphorus is often used in the presence of HI for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for elimination, but more commonly, it's used for the substitution of certain groups. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used for the dehydrohalogenation or for the substitution of a halogen atom. Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the Staudinger reaction, but that's for azides and triphenylphosphine, not red phosphorus. Alternatively, HI can act as a reagent in the hydrolysis of esters under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, is it a case of the Clemmensen reduction? Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but maybe with red phosphorus and HI, it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone, reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it can lead to the formation of an alcohol. Wait,
