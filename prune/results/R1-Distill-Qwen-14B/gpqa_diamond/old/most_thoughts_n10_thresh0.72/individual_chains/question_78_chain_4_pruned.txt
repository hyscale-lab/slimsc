Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given that the charge q is moving with some trajectory. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions. Let me recall the basic concepts.

First, I remember that when a charge is moving, it's not just the electric field but also the magnetic field that has to be considered. Maxwell's equations come into play here. The potentials are related to the fields through the potentials. So, the scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B.

The scalar potential V is given by Coulomb's law when the charge is stationary. But when it's moving, there are some adjustments. Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge is similar to the static case but modified by the motion, right? Or does it stay the same? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the scalar potential due to a charge in motion is still due to the electric field, but the vector potential comes from the magnetic field. Oh wait, but how exactly are they related?

I remember that the electric field E can be expressed as the negative gradient of V minus the time derivative of A. So, E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t
