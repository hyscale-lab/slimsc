Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist, right? Or at least, we haven't observed them yet. But this question is about how Maxwell's equations would change if they did exist.

Let me think about Maxwell's equations as I remember them. There are four, right? Each describes a different aspect of how electric and magnetic fields behave.

The first equation is Gauss's law for electricity: the divergence of E equals rho over epsilon zero. That's about the electric field emanating from charges. Since this universe allows isolated magnetic poles, maybe this equation would change? I'm not sure. Wait, no—Gauss's law for E is about electric charge, not magnetic. So unless there's a magnetic charge, maybe it's not affected. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let me put that aside for now.

The second equation is Gauss's law for magnetism: the divergence of B equals zero. Oh! Right, because in our universe, there are no isolated magnetic monopoles, so the magnetic field lines form closed loops. If this universe has them, then Gauss's law would change. So divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So that equation would definitely be different.

The third equation is Faraday's law of induction. It's about the curl of E being equal to the negative rate of change of B. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect this equation? Well, Faraday's law relates changing magnetic fields to circulating electric fields. I think this might remain the same because the presence of monopoles doesn't directly change how changing B fields induce E fields. Unless there's some modification due to magnetic current, but I'm not sure.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition. It says the curl of B is equal to mu zero times J plus the displacement current. Again, this deals with how magnetic fields are created by currents and changing electric fields. If there are magnetic currents (like if monopoles exist), this equation might need to change. Because in our equations, there's no magnetic current term. So Ampère's law would have an additional term for magnetic current density.

Now, the question is asking which Maxwell's equations are different in this scenario. So we're looking for the equations that change because of the existence of magnetic monopoles.

So, the second equation (div B = 0) would change to div B = rho_m (magnetic charge density), I think. And the fourth equation, Ampère's law, would have a term involving the magnetic current. Because Maxwell's equations are symmetric when magnetic monopoles exist. So symmetry suggests that both the divergence and the curl terms would have sources.

Wait, let me think again. The original equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = -dB/dt
4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + epsilon_0 mu_0 dE/dt

If magnetic monopoles exist, the second equation would become div B = rho_m (some term involving magnetic charge density). Also, the fourth equation would have a magnetic current term. So Ampère's law (equation 4) would have something like + J_m (magnetic current) on the right side, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it's equation 4 that gets modified, and equation 2 as well.

Wait, no. The symmetry implies that the equations for E and B are similar. So maybe equation 2 and equation 4 are modified. Or perhaps equation 3 and equation 4? Or another approach: in a universe with magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B isn't zero, so equation 2 changes. Also, the curl of E isn't just about dB/dt. Because in our universe, equation 3 is curl E = -dB/dt, but if there are magnetic currents, then Faraday's law might include a term for the magnetic current.

Wait, no. Wait, Faraday's law is about the induced electric fields due to changing B fields. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps the curl of E would have a term involving the magnetic current density. So equation 3 would change as well. But I'm not too sure about that.

Wait, maybe it's better to recall how Maxwell's equations are modified when magnetic monopoles exist. I think that in such a case, two equations change: the divergence of B (equation 2) and the curl of E (equation 3). Because the original equations are symmetric when magnetic monopoles are present.

So equation 2 becomes div B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. Equation 3 becomes curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (maybe?), where J_m is the magnetic current density. So both equation 2 and equation 3 are modified. So which options correspond to that?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. That's equation 2, which is definitely modified. But the question is which equations are different overall.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field (curl E) and the divergence of the magnetic field (div B). So that would be equation 2 and 3. That sounds right because both would change.

Option C: Circulation of B (curl B) and flux of E. The curl of B is equation 4. Flux of E would be equation 1. Not sure if those are modified.

Option D: The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equation 2 and 4. Equation 4 is curl B. Would that change? Let me think. Equation 4 in our universe is curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps equation 4 would have a term involving J_m. So equation 4 would change. So equation 2 and 4 would be different. That's option D.

But wait, I thought equation 3 would change. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again.

In our universe:

Equation 2: div B = 0
Equation 3: curl E = - dB/dt
Equation 4: curl B = mu_0 (J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt)

In a universe with magnetic monopoles:

Equation 2: div B = rho_m (so equation 2 changes)
Equation 3: curl E = -dB/dt + J_m (if I recall correctly, the J_m would be a term on the right side)
Equation 4: curl B = mu_0 (J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt) + something involving J_m (maybe? Or is it equation 3 that gets the J_m term?)

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetric form. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations are:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
div B = rho_m / mu_0
curl E = - dB/dt - J_m
curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

Wait, that doesn't look symmetric. Alternatively, if you have magnetic charge, the equations become:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
div B = rho_m / mu_0
curl E = - (1) (dB/dt) - J_m
curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 (dE/dt) + mu_0 J_e + something?

Wait, perhaps the correct modified equations are:

Equation 2: div B = rho_m (if we set mu_0 = 1, perhaps)
Equation 4: curl B = mu_0 (J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt) + (something with J_m?), maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 would have a term for the magnetic current. For example, equation 4 might become curl B = mu_0 (J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt) + J_m.

Wait, but in the standard formulation with monopoles, the modified Maxwell's equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = rho_m / (mu_0)
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m
4. curl B = mu_0 (J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt) + (mu_0 / epsilon_0) J_m

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read before that the presence of magnetic monopoles introduces terms into both the divergence of B and the curl of E.

So equation 2: div B = rho_m (assuming appropriate units)
Equation 3: curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

So that's two equations that change.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ones related to the circulation of electric field (curl E) and the divergence of B. That would be equations 2 and 3. So that would be option B.

But another approach: the existence of magnetic monopoles would change the equation for the divergence of B (equation 2) and the equation for the curl of E (equation 3). So two equations are different.

Wait, but the question asks "which of those equations are different?" and the options are about which equations are modified.

Looking again at the options:

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.

That is, equations 2 and 3. So which would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, another way: Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles require that both the divergence of B (equation 2) and the curl of E (equation 3) are non-zero or have additional terms.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but another point: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, besides equation 2 (div B), equation 4 (curl B) might also change. Because equation 4 would have a term involving the magnetic current, perhaps.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the symmetric form of Maxwell's equations when both electric and magnetic charges exist.

In such a case, the equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = rho_m / (mu_0)
3. curl E = - (1/c^2) * dB/dt - J_m
4. curl B = (1/c^2) dE/dt + J_e

Wait, but that's using Gaussian units perhaps? Or some system where c is involved. Alternatively, with SI units:

In SI, equation 3 would have:

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

And equation 4 would have:

curl B = mu_0 (J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt) + J_m'

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same because the curl of B is due to currents and displacement, but if there are magnetic currents, perhaps another term is added.

Wait, maybe equation 4 doesn't change because equation 4 is about how B is generated by currents, but if you have magnetic monopoles, the equation for B's curl would include a term for the magnetic current.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equations when magnetic monopoles exist are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = rho_m / (mu_0)
3. curl E = - (dB/dt) - J_m
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 (dE/dt) + mu_0 J_e + something?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. The original Maxwell's equations (without monopoles) are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = - dB/dt
4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

If magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 2 becomes div B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. Also, equation 3 would get a term involving the magnetic current, so equation 3 becomes curl E = - dB/dt - J_m. So equations 2 and 3 change.

So that means two equations are modified: equation 2 (div B) and equation 3 (curl E).

Looking at the options, option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2). So that's the correct option.

So the answer should be option B.


In a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for the presence of isolated north and south poles. The original Maxwell's equations are:

1. **Gauss's law for electricity**:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}$$  
   This equation remains unchanged because it deals with electric charge, not magnetic monopoles.

2. **Gauss's law for magnetism**:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$  
   In our universe, this equation holds because there are no isolated magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would change to:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m$$  
   where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density.

3. **Faraday's law of induction**:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$  
   In our universe, this equation describes how time-varying magnetic fields induce electric fields. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would also change to include a term for magnetic current density $\mathbf{J}_m$:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mathbf{J}_m$$  

4. **Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition**:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$  
   This equation describes how electric currents and time-varying electric fields generate magnetic fields. The presence of magnetic monopoles does not directly modify this equation, as it primarily deals with electric currents.

From this analysis, the two equations that would change in a universe with magnetic monopoles are:  
- **Equation 2**: The divergence of the magnetic field, which would no longer be zero.  
- **Equation 3**: The circulation of the electric field, which would include a term for magnetic current density.  

Thus, the correct answer is the option that specifies these two equations.  

**Option B**: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.  

Answer: B
