Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about reacting ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. Oh wait, I remember that HBr is a reagent often involved in acid-catalyzed reactions, like additions or substitutions, especially in alkenes.

So the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw its structure. The benzene ring has an oxygen attached, which is connected to a butenyl group. Specifically, the butenyl has a double bond at position 3, so the structure is CH2CH(C(CH3)2)CH2CH2-O-Ph? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl is four carbons long, with double bond at position 3-4 (counting from the benzene). So the structure would be: benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, buten-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the butenyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait. But-3-en-1-yl would have four carbons, with the double bond between C2 and C3. Because if it's but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-Ph? Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at position 3, but that's impossible for butene, which only has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? Wait, no, but-3-enyl would be CH2CH2-CH=CH, but that can't be right because the numbering would be from the
