Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to break it down. Hmm. The question is about the orbital periods of three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. The method used is the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not sure how that affects this particular problem. Maybe it's just context about how they were discovered, and the actual question is about the orbital periods.

The data given includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and their masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's. And between Planet2 and Planet3, the temperature ratio is about 2.3. So Planet2 is 2.3 times less than Planet3, or is it Planet3 is 2.3 times Planet2? Wait, the way the ratio is stated is important. It says Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, so T1/T2 is 1.4, meaning T1 is hotter. Then T2 and T3 is 2.3, so T2/T3 is 2.3? Or T3/T2 is 2.3? Oh, the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So it's T1 over T2 equals 1.4, so T1 is higher. Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is 2.3. I'm not sure if that's T2/T3 or T3/T2. Hmm. The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "between Planet2 and Planet3" which would mean T2 over T3. So T2 is 2.3 times T3? No, wait, because if it's T2 over T3, then Planet2 is hotter than Planet3. But if the ratio is 2.3, then if it's T2/T3=2.3, then Planet2 is hotter. But if it's T3/T2=2.3, then Planet3 is hotter.

Wait, I think the way it's written is that the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so T1/T2 =1.4. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So maybe T2/T3=2.3, or T3/T2=2.3? The question isn't specific. Hmm. Oh, but equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star as well as other factors. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.25, where a is the orbital distance. Oh wait, but assuming the same star for all, and same albedo (given as 0.3 for all), then the temperature ratio should be inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis ratio. Because T is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), so T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) if everything else is same. Because T is proportional to 1
