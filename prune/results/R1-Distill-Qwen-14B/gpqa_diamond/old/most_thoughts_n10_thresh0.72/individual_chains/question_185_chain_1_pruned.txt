Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. 

Wait, Pauli matrices... Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each a 2x2 matrix. And when you take the dot product with n, which is a unit vector, you're probably summing the products of each σ component with the corresponding n component. So σ · n should be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. 

The Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix then. To find the eigenvalues, I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix (which H is, because Pauli matrices are Hermitian and ε is real), the eigenvalues are given by the trace over 2 and ±sqrt(det(H)) over 2 or something like that. Alternatively, since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, maybe the eigenvalues of σ · n are also ±1, but scaled by ε.

Wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. But σ · n is a sum of their scaled versions. Wait no, each σ_i is a matrix, but when you take a linear combination, the eigenvalues change. Alternatively, perhaps σ · n is a unit vector operator, so its eigenvalues would be ±1, but when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues would be ±ε. 

Wait, isn't the trace of σ · n equal to n · (trace of each σ_i multiplied by n_i). But the trace of each Pauli matrix is zero because they are traceless. So the trace of H would be ε times trace of σ · n, which is ε * 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. 

The determinant of σ · n: Each Pauli matrix has determinant -1, I think. Wait, no, let me calculate. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) )= -1. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. But
