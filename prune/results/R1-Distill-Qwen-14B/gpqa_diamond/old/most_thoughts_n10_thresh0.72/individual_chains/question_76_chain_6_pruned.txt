Okay, so I've got this question about creating a mouse embryonic chimera using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Hmm, I remember that chimeras are embryos that have cells from different genetic sources, right? So the question says they're using iPSCs from various tissues, labeled with mRaspberry under a lineage-specific promoter. Oh wait, mRaspberry is a fluorescent protein, probably red. And TUNEL-FITC is used for detecting apoptosis.

So the setup is that they inject these dedifferentiated iPSCs into a blastocyst at the 32-cell stage. Then, they track them over 48 hours. Every 12 hours, they prepare embryos and do TUNEL-FITC staining. Then observe under confocal.

The question is about what the first thing they notice would be. The options are A to D.

Let me think. First, the mRaspberry is under a lineage-specific promoter. So each cell type's iPSCs would express red when they differentiate into that lineage. TUNEL is for apoptosis; it uses FITC, which is green. So when a cell is undergoing apoptosis, it would show green.

Now, when you inject iPSCs into a blastocyst, the blastocyst is already at a stage where it's about to implant. The injected cells will start to integrate and differentiate. The first thing they might look for is where the red-labeled cells are and if they're undergoing apoptosis.

Wait, but what's the first observation? Let's consider the timeline. After injection, the cells have to start differentiating. If the cells are labeled with mRaspberry under their specific promoters, it might take some time for them to express the red. But perhaps at the first time point (12 hours), the cells haven't started differentiating yet. Or maybe they are just starting to, so maybe not many have expressed red.

But wait, the question says they're tracking over 48 hours, and every 12 hours they prepare the embryos. So after the first 12 hours (time 0 to 12), they look. What's happening?

Alternatively, maybe in the initial stages, the iPSCs are still pluripotent and not expressing lineage-specific markers. So the red signal might not be present yet. But if the promoters are lineage-specific, maybe the cells only start expressing the red when they start differentiating.

But if that's the case, perhaps the first thing they notice is that the red signals are not present yet. Or maybe some are starting to appear.

Wait, but the question is about co-localization with apoptotic events. So if the red cells are present and some are undergoing apoptosis, the green (TUNEL) would be in the same area as red.

But let's think about the TUNEL assay. It detects DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. So if the injected iPSCs are differentiating and some are undergoing apoptosis, then the TUNEL would show green in those areas.

So
