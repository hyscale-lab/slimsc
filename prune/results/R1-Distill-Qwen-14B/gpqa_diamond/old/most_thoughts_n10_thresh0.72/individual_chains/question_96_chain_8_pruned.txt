Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy is related to the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, yes, the formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. Or was it divided by something else? Wait, I think the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but I'm not 100% sure about the constants.

So, the problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. The distance d is given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh, since θ is small, the angular size is probably approximated using the small angle formula. So θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size of the object divided by the distance. So, like, θ ≈ r/d, where r is the radius of the event horizon.

Wait, the event horizon of a black hole is at r = 2GM/c², which is the Schwarzschild radius. So the radius r is 2GM/c². So the area A would be 4π r² = 4π (2GM/c²)^2 = 16 π G² M² / c^4. Hmm, but maybe I should just find r first.

So, given that θ is measured in degrees, I need to convert it to radians. Because the small angle approximation uses radians. Oh right, θ in radians is (θ_degrees) * (π / 180). So θ_rad ≈ 10^-17 degrees * π / 180. Let me calculate that. 10^-17 * π / 180 is approximately (3.1416 / 180) * 1e-17 which is roughly 1.745e-19 radians. Hmm, but wait, maybe I can compute that exactly later; perhaps for order of magnitude, it's not necessary.

Wait, the question is about the entropy, so I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The area A is 4π r². But r = d * θ_rad, because for small angles, the length is approximately the distance multiplied by the angle in radians. So r ≈ d * θ_rad.

Wait no, wait: actually, the event horizon's diameter is what's subtended by the angle θ. Because the event horizon is a sphere, but when you observe it, the angular size would correspond to the diameter, right? Or maybe the radius? Hmm, I'm a bit confused there. Let me think. The angular size θ is the angle subtended by the diameter of the event horizon at the observer's location. So the diameter is 2r, so the angle θ = (2r) / d. So solving for r: r = (d * θ) / 2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the formula for r would be (d * θ_rad) / 2. So let me write that down.

r = (d * θ_rad) / 2.

Then, the area A is 4π r².

Once I have A, I can plug it into the entropy formula. So let's compute each step.

First, let's
