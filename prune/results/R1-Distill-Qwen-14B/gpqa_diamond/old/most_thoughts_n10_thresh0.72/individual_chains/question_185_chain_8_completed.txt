Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? Which consists of the Pauli spin matrices σx, σy, σz. And n is a unit vector, so it's in some direction. So the dot product σ · n would be σx nx + σy ny + σz nz. That makes sense.

Since H is a 2x2 matrix because it's a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvalues should be two values. I remember that for Pauli matrices, when you have a combination like σ · n, the eigenvalues are determined by the magnitude of the vector. Since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of σ · n should be 1, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1, because each Pauli matrix squares to identity, and their linear combination with unit coefficients has eigenvalues ±1. 

Wait, but the Hamiltonian is multiplied by ε. Oh right, so the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by those eigenvalues. So that would be ±ε. Or wait, no—because the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so H = ε (σ · n) would have eigenvalues ±ε * 1, which is plus and minus ε. 

Looking at the options, option B says +ε, -ε. Option C includes hbar, which I don't think is here. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, and since ε is an energy constant, the eigenvalues should just be multiples of that. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless; when you have σ · n multiplied by ε, which has units of energy, then the eigenvalues should have units of energy. So yes, the eigenvalues should be ±ε. So the answer is B.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are known to be \(\pm 1\), as the dot product of the Pauli matrices with a unit vector represents a spin operator in a specific direction, and its eigenvalues are determined by the magnitude of the vector. Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) remain \(\pm 1\).

When the Hamiltonian is scaled by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\). This is consistent with the fact that the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator must have the same dimension as energy, which is satisfied here because \(\varepsilon\) has units of energy.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: (+1, -1) is incorrect because the eigenvalues must have units of energy, not dimensionless.
- **Option B**: (+\(\varepsilon\), -\(\varepsilon\)) is correct, as it matches the derived eigenvalues.
- **Option C**: (+\(\varepsilon \hbar/2\), -\(\varepsilon \hbar/2\)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues do not involve \(\hbar\) in this context.
- **Option D**: (+\(\hbar/2\), -\(\hbar/2\)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues must include \(\varepsilon\), which is explicitly part of the Hamiltonian.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
