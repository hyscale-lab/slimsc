Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring and some double bonds or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets because they're at the end of the chain. Maybe it's something else. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid? But the split is triplet. Hmm.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. Aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted aromatic rings.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons, maybe ortho to substituents.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchange or maybe conjugated double bonds. Maybe vinyl protons or something adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

-3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. This is likely a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to something else, perhaps an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. The splitting into a doublet suggests two neighboring protons.

Putting this together, I'm thinking perhaps a benzaldehyde derivative. Or maybe something with an aromatic ring and a conjugated system.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 N, 1 O. Let me think about possible structures.

Looking at the NMR shifts again. The triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde. But more likely, perhaps a ketone? Wait, no, ketones don't have protons. So if it's an aldehyde, but the triplet suggests it's coupled with two others. That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a proton adjacent to an aromatic ring, like in a benzyl position.

Alternatively, the 9.72 could be an acidic proton, like a phenol. But phenols are usually broader and appear around 5-6 ppm. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. Let's think about the triplet. Maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, such as a conjugated enal. Because in but-3-enal, the aldehyde is at one end, and the double bond is adjacent. So the aldehyde proton would couple with the adjacent double bond's protons.

Wait, but in that case, the
