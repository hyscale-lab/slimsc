Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact definitions. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Oh right, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric, probably in polar coordinates but written in terms of x and y. Wait, no, x and y here are just like regular Cartesian coordinates, but maybe we should switch to polar to make things easier. Because when dealing with circles or spheres, polar coordinates are usually better.

So the first step is to recognize the form of the metric. The general form for a metric in two dimensions is ds² = g(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angular one. But in this case, the given metric is in terms of x and y, so maybe I should convert it to polar coordinates.

Let me try that. Let x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². So the denominator of the metric becomes (4 - r²). So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). That makes sense. So now it's in polar form.

Now, the area of a surface in two dimensions can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in polar coordinates is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ²) dr dθ. But since this is a diagonal metric (no cross terms), the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms.

Wait, another approach: For a metric ds² = A(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), the area element dA is A(r) * r dr dθ. Because in polar coordinates, the usual area element is r dr dθ, and here A(r) is the scaling factor for that.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The general area element for a metric ds² = g_rr dr² + 2 g_rθ dr dθ + g_θθ dθ² is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ²) dr dθ. But in this case, g_rθ is zero because the metric is diagonal. So sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ. So g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is [32/(4 - r²)] * r². So the area element would be sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] ) dr dθ. Wait, that's sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) dr dθ. Which simplifies to (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. So dA = (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm getting that right. Alternatively, another way to think: the area is the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from whatever the minimum is to maximum.

Wait, in the metric, denominator 4 - r² must
