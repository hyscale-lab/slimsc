Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, using TLC, they observed that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning it's reacting, and two new spots appeared. We need to choose which products are formed from the options A to D.

Hmm. Okay, so the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me visualize this structure. The benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached to a but-3-en-1-yl chain. The chain is 2,2-dimethyl, so the structure would be:

The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 3, so it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? But wait, the numbering would be from the alkoxy end. So position 1 is the end attached to oxygen (O), so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait no, that can't be because but-3-en-1-yl would have four carbons, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C3 and C4? Wait that can't be because that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double between 3 and 4, but that's not possible because that's the end. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to benzene. Wait no, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So on the but-3-en-1-yl group, the substituents are on C2. So the structure is:

O
|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2

Wait, no, but it's but-3-en-1-yl. So perhaps it's:

O
|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2?

Wait, another approach. Let me write the structure correctly. The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1
