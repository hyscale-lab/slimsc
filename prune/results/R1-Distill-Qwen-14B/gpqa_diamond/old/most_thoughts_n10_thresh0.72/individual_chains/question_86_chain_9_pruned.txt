Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out which starting materials A and B give specific products when treated with different reducing agents. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a chemist performed two reactions. In the first reaction, compound A is treated with LiBH4 and H+. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In the second reaction, compound B is treated with BH3 and H+, giving the same product but with the (S) configuration. The options for A and B are given, all involving 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with different R and S configurations.

Wait, so both A and B are the same compound structurally, but with different stereoisomerism. The only difference is the configuration (R or S) of each. So, when they're reduced, they give products with opposite configurations.

I remember that when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the reducing agent and the conditions. Oh right, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to the formation of secondary alcohols. But wait, how does the configuration come into play here?

I think about the mechanism of ketone reduction. The ketone, say, (R)-configured, when reduced, would form an alcohol. The reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols typically doesn't change the configuration because it's a two-step process. Wait, no, wait. No, the addition of the hydride is a concerted process. So the hydride comes from the less substituted side because of steric factors, but wait, wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the reduction of ketones by LiBH4 and BH3 (which is a milder reagent, but actually, BH3 is used with other conditions like in the hydroboration, but wait no, BH3 is often used in the formation of alcohols via hydroboration-oxidation when it's a borane, but in this case, the question says BH3 with H+.

Wait, no, wait. The first reaction uses LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent. It's commonly used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. The second reaction uses BH3, which I think is also a reducing agent but perhaps under different conditions or maybe it's actually BH3 with something else, like THF or another solvent. Wait, no, I think BH3 is used in hydroboration, which is for alkenes. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions.

Wait, wait, in the problem, both reactions are reductions. So both LiBH4 and BH3 are used for that. Let me recall: LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, but BH3, I'm a bit fuzzy on. Oh wait, BH3 is typically used with other reagents, like in the formation of alcohols via
