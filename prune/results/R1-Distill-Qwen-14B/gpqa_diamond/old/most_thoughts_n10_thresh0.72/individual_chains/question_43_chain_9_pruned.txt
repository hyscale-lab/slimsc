Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is a formyl group), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So meta means they are separated by one carbon, right? Like each is two positions apart. So if the carboxylic acid is on position 1, the formyl would be on 4, and the cyano on 6? Or wait, maybe I should think about numbering them.

Wait, the substituents are meta to each other. So each is meta to the others. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's try drawing a benzene ring. Let's imagine the carboxylic acid (which is the parent here, I think) is on position 1. Then the formyl (CHO) and cyano (CN) are each meta to each other and to the COOH.

Wait, meta to one another. So each substituent is meta to the others. So if COOH is at position 1, then the formyl would be at 4 (since 1 and 4 are meta), and the cyano at 6 (1 and 6 are meta as well because benzene is a ring). Or wait, no. Wait, position 1, then the meta positions are 3 and 5. Hmmâ€”maybe I'm getting confused.
