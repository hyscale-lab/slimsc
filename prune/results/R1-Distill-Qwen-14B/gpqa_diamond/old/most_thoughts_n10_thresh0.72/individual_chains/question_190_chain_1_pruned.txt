Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilic reactivity. Hmm, let's see. I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent and the basicity of the nucleophile. The question is about aqueous solution, so it's polar protic solvent. In such solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the stronger it is. 

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Wait, I should think about their basicity and how they're solvated. In polar protic solvents, the weaker bases tend to be better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. Or wait, no, I think that's for comparing same group ions. Oh right, but across different atoms, the solvent plays a bigger role.

So in aqueous solution (which is a polar protic solvent), the order of nucleophilicity is usually: weaker bases are better because they're less stabilized by solvation. But wait, for different atoms, like O vs S, S is less electronegative but in their conjugate bases, maybe that's different.

Wait, HS⁻ (ethanethiolate) is a stronger nucleophile than OH⁻ in polar protic solvents because it's less solvated. Wait no, but wait, in a polar protic solvent like water, the more polarizing the nucleophile, the better. So HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in such solvents because even though it's less basic, it's less solvated. Because S is larger, and HS⁻ is more polarizable.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about their basicities. I think the basicity order for these nucleophiles is: HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻? Or stronger? Wait, pKa of conjugate acids: H2S has higher pKa (around 7), so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ (since H
