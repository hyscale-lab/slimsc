Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity technique detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right? Or wait, no, it's more about the mass and the orbital distance, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, their masses are about the same, and the stars have the same mass. The RV method detected each. 

The first planet causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and the second causes 7. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the Doppler shift is related to the star's velocity. The formula I recall is something like the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ))^(1/3) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M_star))^(1/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 AU)^n ) ) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is given by a formula that depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Or perhaps it's K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but I might be mixing up some terms.

Wait, let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3))) ) * (sin i) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(something) ), but since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars (Neptune is much less than Sun's mass), M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, the formula simplifies for our purposes.

I think
