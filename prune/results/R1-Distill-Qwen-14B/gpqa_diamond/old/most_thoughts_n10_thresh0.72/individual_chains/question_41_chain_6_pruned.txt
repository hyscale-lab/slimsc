Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light passing through moving glass. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the observer is watching the light coming towards them, but the glass itself is moving towards them as well. Interesting.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. So in the glass, the light's speed would normally be 1/n, since c is given as 1 here. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed as measured by the observer?

I think this is a problem involving relative velocities. Because the glass is moving, the speed of the light observed might be different. But wait, in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly, but that's not how it works with light. Because according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. Oh right! So regardless of the motion of the source or the medium, the speed of light in a vacuum remains c. But in this case, the light is in a medium, the glass.

Wait, but when the medium itself is moving, does that change the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab frame? Hmm. I'm a bit
