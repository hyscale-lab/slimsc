Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess I have to consider how relativity affects things.

Wait, the question says it's 1-dimensional and obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's similar to the classical case, but with relativistic effects. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². Setting them equal: (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v² → v = sqrt(kA²/m) → option C gives this, but that's the non-relativistic case. But since the question is relativistic, option C is probably not the answer.

But wait, in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; there's also rest mass energy. So the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Let me think about how that affects the speed.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy mc² and the kinetic energy. The potential energy in a relativistic oscillator might be different too, but maybe for small amplitudes, it's similar to the classical case. However, the question is about maximum amplitude, so maybe relativistic effects become significant.

Wait, the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator might be treated as (1/2)k x², similar to the classical case, but when x is at maximum A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)m v²; it's (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So, the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy at maximum speed. At maximum displacement A, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all its energy is potential. But wait, no, at maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is minimal. Wait, no, the maximum speed occurs when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), so at that point, all the energy is kinetic, and the potential is zero. Wait, in the classical case, yes. So in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at x=0, moving at maximum speed v_max, the total energy is the kinetic energy plus the rest energy.

So, the total energy E would be mc² (rest energy) + K, where K is the kinetic energy. But wait, no—actually, wait, in relativity, the total energy is γ mc², which includes both the rest mass and the kinetic energy.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy. The total mechanical energy of the oscillator (which is conserved) would be (at x=0, maximum speed) the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy (which is zero there). Wait no, because at x=0, the potential
