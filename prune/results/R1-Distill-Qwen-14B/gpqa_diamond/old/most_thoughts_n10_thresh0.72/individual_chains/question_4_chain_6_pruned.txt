Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both a north and south pole; you can't isolate them. So I guess in this other universe, they can have isolated poles, which probably changes some of Maxwell's equations.

Wait, Maxwell's equations... right, there are four of them. Let me think about each one. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which deals with electric flux and charge. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which in our world says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero because there are no isolated magnetic charges. Oh right, that's the one where we say magnetic monopoles don't exist. 

So in this universe, since they do have isolated poles (like a monopole), the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So that equation must change. So the second equation would be modified. But what about the other equations?

The third equation is Faraday's Law, which deals with the circulation of the electric field and the time derivative of the magnetic field. The fourth is Amp√®re's Law with Maxwell's addition, dealing with the circulation of the magnetic field and displacement current.

Wait, so in our world, the divergence of B is zero because there's no monopole. But if monopoles exist, the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So Maxwell's second equation would change.

But the question is, which equations are different? Because the options are about which equations are altered.

Wait, the options are about which of Maxwell's equations change. Let me look at the options:

Option A says the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. That would be equation 2, yes. So in our universe, equation 2 is divergence B equals zero. Here, it would be divergence B equals some constant times the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 changes.

What about other equations? Well, equation 1 is about electric fields and charge, so unless there's some other change, like if magnetic charges contribute to electric fields, but I think Maxwell's equations are separate for E and B. So equation 1 probably remains the same.

Equation 3 is about the curl of E being minus the time derivative of B. Wait, that equation comes from Faraday's Law, and I don't
