Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it again. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. How does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A to D, each with different power laws based on plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to Earth's orbit. The formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and vice versa.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with plx. So if I have a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let's denote that as n.

I think the approach is to calculate the volume of a shell at a certain distance and see how many stars are in each shell. So considering spherical shells in space.

The volume of a thin spherical shell with radius r and thickness dr is (4/3)π(r^2 + (r+dr)^2) dr? Wait, no, I think for a thin shell, dr is very small, so (r+dr)^2 ≈ r^2 + 2r dr. But actually, when dr is infinitesimally small, the volume of the shell is approximately 4π r² dr. Oh right, because the surface area is 4π r², and dr is the thickness. So volume element dV = 4π r² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since parallax plx = 1/r, so r = 1/plx. So r is inversely proportional to plx.

Let me express everything in terms of plx. So r = 1/plx, which means dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, actually, let's think about differentials. If plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/plx²) ? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, I should express dr in terms of dplx. So plx = 1/r, so r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because if plx increases, r decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, r decreases by dr.

So the volume element dV will be 4π r² dr. Substitute r = 1/plx, so r² is 1/plx². And dr is -dplx/(plx²). So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (-dplx/plx²) )? Wait, no. Let's compute it correctly.

Wait, dr = -dplx / (plx^2) because dr = d(1/plx) = -1/(plx^2) dplx.

So dV = 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx²) * (-dplx / plx²) )= 4π (-dplx) / plx^4.

But wait, the volume element is positive, so the negative just indicates that as plx increases, r decreases. So the absolute value is 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about this differently. Since the number of stars depends on the volume, which depends on the distance. So the number of stars in a shell is n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per cubic parsec, say).

Alternatively, considering that the number of stars in a given volume is n * volume, and the volume depends on r. But since we're looking at the number per unit parallax range, we need to express it in terms of plx.

So for a given plx, the corresponding radius is r = 1/plx. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume at radius r plus a small change dr. Wait, maybe it's easier to express the volume as a function of plx.

Let me consider two parallax values: plx and plx + dplx. The distance r corresponds to plx, and r + dr would correspond to plx + dplx. But wait, no, because if plx increases, r decreases. So if I have a parallax plx, the distance is r = 1/plx. The next parallax is plx + dplx, which corresponds to r' = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ 1/plx - dplx / plx² (using a Taylor expansion, assuming dplx is small).

So the distance difference dr is r - r' =
