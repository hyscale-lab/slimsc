Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. 

So, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main ring is cyclohexanone, right? The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. 

At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group. So that's -CH2OH attached to the cyclohexane ring at carbon 3. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH3)=? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually the substituent where the substituent is attached to the cyclohexane at the middle carbon of the propene. So the structure would be CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)2C=CH-? No, no, wait. Let me think again. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the second carbon? Or wait, no. Maybe it's (CH2)CH2 with a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. So the structure is (CH2) attached to the ring, then a double bond. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2, and the substit
