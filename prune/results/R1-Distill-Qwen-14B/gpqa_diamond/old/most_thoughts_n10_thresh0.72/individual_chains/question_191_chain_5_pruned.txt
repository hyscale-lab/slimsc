Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through each reaction.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (which is a CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group, right? So the structure is CH2=C(CH2) attached to the cyclohexane ring. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)-, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C=CH2? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with the substituent on C2. So it's CH2=C(CH2-) attached to the ring. So the substituent is CH2-C=CH2. Wait, no, that's not right. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-C=CH2? Or maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond from 1 to 2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C=CH2, but attached via the C2? So the structure is cyclohexanone with a CH2OH at C3 and a CH2-C=CH2 at C5.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. NaH is a strong base, a deprotonating agent. So benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So probably, the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) will be deprotonated by NaH to form an alkoxide, which then reacts with benzyl bromide (which is CH2=CHPh, wait no, benzyl bromide is PhCH2Br. Wait, no, benzyl bromide is PhCH2Br, right? Because benzyl is the substituent on CH2, which is attached to the Br. So when the NaH deprotonates the -CH2OH to -CH2O‚Åª, then benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) would react as an electrophile. So the O- would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to an alkylation. So the product would have a benzyl group added to the hydroxymethyl carbon. So the -CH2OH becomes -CH2-O-Bn, where Bn is benzyl. Wait, no, wait: when you have an alkoxide attacking an alkyl bromide, you get an ether. So the product would be -CH2-O-CH
