Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The problem involves several reactions and identifying the molecular symmetry group of a product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember from my studies that these are point groups, which describe the symmetry of molecules.

Let me break down the information given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm, I need to figure out what each of these substances might be. Let's think about the reactions.

First, thinking about reaction 1: 8 equivalents of B reacting with A. Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen? Because sometimes metals react with halogens to form salts. For example, sodium (A) reacting with chlorine (B) to form sodium chloride. But wait, sodium chloride is a white solid, not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's copper reacting with sulfur? Not sure. Or perhaps something else.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, another thought: maybe C is a transition metal complex. For example, something like CuSO4 is blue, but maybe a different compound.

Let me think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to give back A and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. That suggests that C might be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. For example, if C is a sulfite salt, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate? No, because when sulfate salts react with water, they usually don't produce two different acids. Wait, maybe C is a nitride? Because nitride salts can hydrolyze to produce ammonia and another acid, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, when metal sulfides react with water, they can produce H2S gas and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But in this problem, C reacting with water yields A (so the metal would come back) and two acids. Hmm, wait, maybe the salt is something else.

Wait, another angle: when a salt of a weak acid and a strong base is hydrolyzed, it can produce a weak acid and a strong acid. But I'm not sure. Let me think about specific examples.

Wait, let's think about C reacting with water to form A plus F and G. So, the formula might be something like A reacting with B to form C, which then reacts with water to give A, F, and G.

Wait, if A is a metal, and B is a halogen, then C would be a halide. But for example, if A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine (Cl2), then C is NaCl. But NaCl doesn't react with water to give anything except maybe when it's in the presence of something else—no, that doesn't fit because NaCl is stable in water.

Wait, maybe B is another type of gas. Let me think about other possibilities. What if B is sulfur? But then, reacting with a metal to form a sulfide. Sulfides can react with water to form H2S (a weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. Wait, but in that case, the metal hydroxide would be a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit F and G being acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, if A is sodium (Na), then C could be NaNO3. When NaNO3 reacts with water, it doesn't produce any acid. So that's not it.

Wait another angle: Maybe C is a compound that when it reacts with water, it produces two different acids. Like if it's a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When that reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and NaOH (a strong base, not acid). Hmm, no, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with water but doesn't produce acids, just remains as is. Hmm. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps F and G are like HCl and another acid, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate, but that's not giving two acids. Maybe C is NH4NO3? When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into NH4+ and NO3-.

Alternatively, perhaps
