Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with some underlying symmetry principles.

The question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick which combination is correct.

Wait, wait. So the question is which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect. I think that SMEFT is built by adding operators that don't break certain symmetries. Let me try to remember what symmetries are part of the Standard Model.

First, I know that the Standard Model (SM) respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and also CPT symmetry. Wait, but what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincaré? Oh right, Poincaré includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. Since SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM, all its operators should respect the same symmetries the SM does.

Wait, but wait. So if the SM respects Poincaré, then SMEFT's operators must also respect that. Because if you add operators that don't, then they would break those symmetries. So Poincaré is a must.

What about Lorentz symmetry? Since Poincaré includes Lorentz, but I'm not sure if operators could violate Lorentz without affecting Poincaré. No, because Lorentz is part of Poincaré. So if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it would break Poincaré too. So all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries.

Next, CP symmetry. The SM doesn't have a CP symmetry that's exact, except for some cases. But in SMEFT, I think that operators can violate CP. Because in the Standard Model, CP violation occurs, especially in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can include terms that break CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

Then, CPT symmetry. The SM is CPT symmetric because it's a quantum field theory. I think that CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories because of the spin-statistics theorem and other reasons. So any effective theory like SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry. Because if it didn't, the theory would have issues with unitarity or other fundamental principles. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

Let me recap. The question is which symmetries must all operators respect. So:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes, must respect. Because SMEFT is part of a QFT framework that includes it.

2. Poincaré symmetry: Yes, because it's part of the foundation. So operators must respect it.

3. CP symmetry: No, because operators can include terms that violate CP. For example, operators that change the strong CP, like the θ term in QCD. Wait, but in SMEFT, do they include operators that violate CP? Or is it that the SM has some CP violation, but the operators in SMEFT can be CP violating.

Wait, but when you write effective operators, they
