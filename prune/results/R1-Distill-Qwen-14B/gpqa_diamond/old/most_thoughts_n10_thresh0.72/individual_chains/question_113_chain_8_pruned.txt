Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. I remember that when identifying an unknown compound, looking at the spectroscopic data is key. The question gives me FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec data. I'll go through each one step by step.

Alright, starting with the FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 cm-1 probably indicates O-H stretching, like from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, the two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 might be relevant too. I know that carbonyl groups (C=O) typically absorb around 1700 cm-1. The 1650 could be another carbonyl group, maybe conjugated or something else. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or an amide? Hmm, but amides would have a peak around 1650 for the N-H bend, but the O-H in amides is usually less broad. I'm not sure yet.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule probably has an alkene group. Also, the presence of O-H in the FTIR suggests maybe an alcohol or a ketone, but wait, wait. If there's a carbonyl, which is at 1700, that could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. Wait, but I also see a peak at 1650. Could that be an ester? No, esters' carbonyls are usually around 1700-1750. Wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a conjugated carbonyl. Like an aromatic ketone? Or perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Oh, that makes sense. Because conjugated double bonds can lower the carbonyl stretching frequency a bit. So maybe it's an enone system, like a conjugated ketone.

So if the compound has a conjugated double bond (vinyl H in NMR) and a carbonyl group, maybe it's something like cyclohexenone? Or perhaps an ester with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. But let's think about the molecular formula.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about what fragments give that. 45 could be a common fragment like (CH3)2O (which is 45?) Wait, (CH3)2O is 3*(1) + 16 = 21? No, wait, 2*(CH3) is 2*15=30, plus O is 16, so 46. No, that's not it. Wait, 45 is 9 + 36? Hmm, maybe it's a CH2O group? Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde (15 + 2 + 16 = 33?) No, no, wait: C is 12, H
