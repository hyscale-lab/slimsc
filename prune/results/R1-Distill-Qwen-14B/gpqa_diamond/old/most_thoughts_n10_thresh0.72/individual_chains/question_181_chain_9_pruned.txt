Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question is about what happens if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8 and a half minutes ago. And we need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, right? I think the pp chain has a couple of branches. The pp-I branch is the main one where two protons fuse to deuterium, then another proton fuses to make helium-3, and then two helium-3s combine into helium-4. But then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches as well.

Oh right, the pp-III branch is a less significant part of the proton-proton chain. I think it involves a different pathway. In pp-III, a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons, but one of them is actually a positron, which is emitted in the process. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, I remember that the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a helium-3 fuses with a helium-4, but that's more the CNO cycle. No, wait, the CNO cycle is a different process altogether. Let me think again. Oh, right! The pp-III branch is the reaction where a helium-3 captures a proton to form a helium-4, but that's not right because that's part of the main pp-I branch. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is another reaction. Oh, I think I remember now. The pp-III branch is when two helium-3 nuclei combine to form a helium-4, but that's actually the main pp-I branch. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III is a side reaction where a helium-3 captures two protons, one of which is converted into a neutron, but that doesn't make sense because protons are being converted into neutrons, which would require a higher energy.

Wait, maybe I should look this up in my mind. So the main branches are:

1. pp-I: two protons fuse to deuterium, then another proton fuses to make helium-

Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios in two different energy bands. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, with the proton-proton (pp) chain being the main one. There are different branches in the pp chain, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III, I think. The question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is one of the steps where a helium-3 nucleus fuses with a helium-4 nucleus to form carbon-12, which is part of the CNO cycle maybe? Wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different process altogether. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. 

Wait, the pp chain has several steps. The pp-I branch produces boron-8, and then that undergoes more reactions. The pp-II and pp-III are maybe different pathways. Oh, pp-III probably refers to a specific reaction in the chain that leads to higher energy neutrinos. Because I remember that in the Sun, the dominant neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, which is from the pp-I branch. But there are also neutrinos from other processes, like the CNO cycle. 

If the pp-III branch stops, that means a particular part of the pp chain isn't contributing anymore. But how does this affect the neutrino flux? Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun's core. Well, the pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy ones. Because the pp chain is the main source, but the CNO contributes a smaller fraction. 

But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower than band 2. 

If the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, what would happen to the neutrinos in each band? Well, if pp-III was a significant source of neutrinos in a particular energy range, stopping it would reduce the flux in that range. 

Wait, I think that the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy than those from the pp chain. Because the CNO cycle operates at higher temperatures and densities. So the neutrinos from CNO are more energetic. So if pp-
