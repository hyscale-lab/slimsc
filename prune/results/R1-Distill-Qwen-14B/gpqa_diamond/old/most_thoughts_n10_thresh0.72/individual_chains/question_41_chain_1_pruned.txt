Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a light beam propagating through glass. The glass has an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when dealing with light moving through a medium like glass, the speed of light changes based on the refractive index. But wait, what happens when the medium itself is moving relative to the observer?

I think this has something to do with the frame of reference. The glass is moving, so the observer in the lab sees the light beam in a different way than someone inside the glass would. Wait, but light's behavior in moving mediaâ€”I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? So in the glass, the speed is 1/n, assuming c is 1 as given. But that's the speed relative to the medium. Now, if the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed relative to the lab frame?

Oh, right! This is similar to the scenario where you have a river flowing, and a boat moving in the water. The boat's speed relative to the water is one thing, but relative to the bank, it's different. So in this case, the light's speed in the glass (relative to the glass) is 1/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v.

Wait, but light is electromagnetic waves. Does the velocity of the medium affect the speed of light in that medium? I'm a bit confused here. Because in classical mechanics, velocities add up, but for light, things might be different because of relativity.

Wait, in the context of special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the source's motion. But wait, that's in a vacuum. This is in a medium.

Oh, this is tricky. So, the problem says the speed of light
