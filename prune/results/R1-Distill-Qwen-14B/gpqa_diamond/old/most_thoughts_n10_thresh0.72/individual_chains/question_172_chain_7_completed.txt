Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and maybe the Saha equation, but wait, the question says the photospheres are in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That probably means the Boltzmann equation is the way to go here.

So, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I'm a bit rusty, but I think the Boltzmann factor relates the population of different energy levels. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the degeneracy, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Since the question is about the ratio of the populations, maybe the g factors are the same here, or they're considering the same transition, so g_i/g_j might be 1. Then the ratio would be n1/n2 = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) )^-1? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The energy difference ΔE is E_i - E_j. If level i is higher than j, then for the excitation, the number in the higher level is n_i = n_j * (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

But in this problem, it's the excitation in a specific energy level. Oh wait, they said that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio n1/n2 = 2. Or maybe n1 is twice n2, or n2 is twice n1? Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the higher energy level (say level 1) has a population n1, and in star_2, the same level has population n2. So n1 = 2 n2.

So the ratio n1/n2 = 2. Using the Boltzmann equation, that's 2 = exp( (E_1 - E_2)/(k T) ), but wait, no: wait, the energy difference is ΔE = E_1 - E_2. So if E_1 is higher than E_2, then for star_1 and star_2:

n1 = (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) * n2 = (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) * n2 ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The ratio of the populations in the two stars is (n1/n2) = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] multiplied by (g1/g2)/(g1/g2) if g is same. So for same g, it's exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ). Because when you take the ratio n1/n2 = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) ? Wait, let me compute that step by step.

n1/n2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So, n1/n2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But in the problem, n1 is twice n2, so that ratio is 2.

So ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, because ln(n1/n2) = (ΔE /k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me recall the value of k. k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same number as ΔE here. So ΔE = k * T0, where T0 is 1 K, since 1.38e-23 J = k * 1 K.

So substituting ΔE = k * 1 K.

So ln(2) = (k * 1 K)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Simplify: ln(2) = 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, the right-hand side can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So putting it all together:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but in the equation I derived, ln(2) is equal to (1/T2 - 1/T1). Let me write it again.

ln(2) = [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Which is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the equation.

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2)= (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So the correct answer is D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is applied, which relates the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature of the system. The key equation is:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the populations of the excited energy level in stars 1 and 2, respectively, \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are the effective temperatures of the stars.

Given that the atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as those in star 2, the ratio \( n_1/n_2 = 2 \). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting the right-hand side:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
