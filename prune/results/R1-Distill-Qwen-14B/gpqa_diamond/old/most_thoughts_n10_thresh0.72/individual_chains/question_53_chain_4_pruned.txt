Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The IR spectrum shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a characteristic carbonyl peak around 1700 cm^-1. The NMR spectrum has six signals. Let me break down the NMR data.

So, the 1H NMR shows:
- Two signals for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, the substitution could be in positions that cause different splitting. For example, meta or para. Wait, but wait, the ring is six-membered and di-substituted, so maybe it's ortho, meta, or para substitution. The two signals suggest maybe two sets of equivalent protons. Hmm, like maybe two doublets or something else. Wait, the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. So each signal could be a set of equivalent protons. 

- Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically from double bonds, like in alkenes or maybe adjacent to an ester. So maybe there's an ester group connected to a double bond, like an enol ester or something else. Wait, but the ester itself is O-CO-O, so perhaps the vinyl is part of a substituent attached to the ring.

- Two signals for –CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. No signals for –CH2, which suggests no methylene groups. So all the carbons in CH3 are attached directly to something else, maybe an oxygen or another carbon.

So putting this together. The compound is an ester, so the general formula would be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, wait, no, esters are R-CO-O-R'. Oh wait, no, wait. The ester group is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups.

So the compound has an aromatic ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester group. But wait, the IR shows the presence of an ester, so
