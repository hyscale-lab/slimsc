Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't isolate them. But in this scenario, that's possible. So how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and relate to charges and currents. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère-Maxwell Law: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Right. So in our universe, the divergence of B is zero because there are no isolated magnetic charges. That's Gauss's Law for Magnetism. But in this parallel universe, if you can have isolated North or South poles, that would mean magnetic monopoles exist.

So if magnetic monopoles exist, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, ∇·B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how ∇·E relates to electric charge density. So Gauss's Law for Magnetism would change. That's equation (2).

But wait, are there other equations that would change? Let me think. The other equations deal with the curl of E and B. Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect Faraday's Law?

Wait, Faraday's Law involves the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. I don't think the existence of magnetic monopoles directly affects that equation because Faraday's Law is about induced electric fields from changing magnetic fields. But wait, in some formulations, if you have magnetic current (like a current made of monopoles), it might affect other equations.

Wait, another thought. There's a dual set of Maxwell's equations sometimes considered when you have magnetic monopoles. In that case, not only does the divergence of B change, but the curl of E also changes. Because in the presence of magnetic currents, Faraday's Law would have an additional term.

Wait, in the standard equations,
