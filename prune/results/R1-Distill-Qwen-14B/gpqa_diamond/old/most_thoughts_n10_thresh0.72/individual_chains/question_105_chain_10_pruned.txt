Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's read what the question says. 

Alright, so there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that half. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness change amplitude as these spots do.

Wait, so the setup is that the spots cause a dip in brightness when they're on the visible side, similar to a planet blocking the star's light. So I need to find the planet's radius relative to the star's radius to give the same signal.

First off, I remember that the change in brightness (the transit depth) depends on the ratio of the areas. The formula is ΔF ≈ (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, that's when the planet is causing a partial eclipse, right? Because when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light.

But in this case, it's not a planet but star spots. So how does that work? The spots are cooler regions, so when they're on the day side, they make the star appear dimmer. The effect is similar to a planet blocking light, but the mechanism is different. So the observed brightness dip should be similar to the planet's effect.

Wait, but let me think about it. When a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, so the observed flux drops by the area ratio squared. For the star spots, the spots themselves are cooler, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, that part of the star contributes less flux. So the total flux from the star would decrease by the area of the spots times the difference in their flux compared to the rest of the star.

Let me break it down. The star's total flux without spots would be uniform, but with spots, part of it is dimmer. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so 5000 K. So the flux from the spots is lower.

The flux from a star (or any blackbody) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the flux from the spots would be F_spot = σ*(5000)^4, and from the rest of the star, F_rest = σ*(6000)^4.

But wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the total flux when the spots are in view would be (filling factor * F_spot) + (1 - filling factor) * F_rest, all multiplied by the area of the hemisphere, but wait, maybe it's better to compute the fractional change.

Wait, let's model it. The star's total flux without spots would be F_total = σT^4 * A, where A is the area of the star. But with spots covering a part of the star, the flux is F = (1 - f) * F_rest + f * F_spot, where f is the filling factor.

Wait, no, because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, either the spotted hemisphere is facing us or not. So if the star is rotating, when the spots are on the day side (facing us), we see the spots' effect. Otherwise, the spots are on the night side, so we don't see their effect. So the brightness variation depends on the rotation period.

Wait, but the question says that the star has one hemisphere covered, so when it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dimming would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. Hmm, but the filling factor is 20% on that hemisphere. Oh, wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the total area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere.

Wait
