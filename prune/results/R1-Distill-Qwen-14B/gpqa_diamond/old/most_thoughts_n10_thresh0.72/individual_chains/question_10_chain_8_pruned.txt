Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities, and I'm trying to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, so the formula is density = mass/volume. So, to find which planet is the densest, I need to calculate the density of each option.

Let me list out each option again to make sure I have them straight:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth, which has a known density. Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this one's density would be the same as Earth, I think.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given here. So that's straightforward. Its density is 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, wait. Is that correct? Because if the mass is 2 Earth masses, and if it's same size as Earth, wouldn't the density be higher? Because density is mass/volume. If the volume depends on radius cubed, and mass is doubling, but if the radius stays the same, the volume is same, so density would double. But in this option, the density is same as Earth. Hmm, maybe this planet is larger? Wait, the question doesn't specify the radius, only the mass and the given density. So I think option b is a planet that has a mass of 2 Earth masses but a density of 5.5, so same as Earth. But wait, Earth's density is 5.5, so maybe this is confusing. Wait, Earth's density is about 5.5, so if this planet has the same density, but double the mass, that would imply a larger radius because Volume is proportional to radius cubed. Because, using density = mass/volume, if mass doubles and density stays same, volume must double. So volume is proportional to radius cubed, so radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius.

But in any case, for option b, the density is given as 5.5, so I can take that as a given.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Wait, same composition implies same
