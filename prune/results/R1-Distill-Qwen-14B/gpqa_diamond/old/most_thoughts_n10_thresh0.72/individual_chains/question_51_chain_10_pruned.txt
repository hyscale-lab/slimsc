Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves interactions between charges, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact approach.

Let me start by breaking down the problem. We have a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Since the sphere is grounded, I think that means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge on it can go into the ground. Wait, but if the sphere is a conductor, charges on it would reside on the surface.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded. So any induced charges on the sphere would be neutralized by the ground, right? Or wait, no. When a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But because it's grounded, the conductor can lose or gain electrons to maintain an overall neutral charge. Let me think: when a positive charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's electrons (negative charges) will be attracted to the near side, creating a negative charge there. But since the sphere is a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges will redistribute. However, since it's grounded, any excess charge would leave the sphere. Wait no, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the sphere's potential is the same as the ground. But I'm not sure how that affects the system.

Wait, maybe I should model this using image charges. Oh right, there's a method where you can replace the conducting sphere with an image charge. I think the setup involves a charge q outside a conducting sphere, and you can find an image charge such that the potential due to q and the image charge is the same as the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

So, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere. But wait, the sphere is grounded, which complicates things a bit. Let me recall that when a sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero (same as the ground's potential). So, the presence of an external charge q will induce charges on the sphere such that the potential on the sphere's surface remains zero.

Alternatively, I remember that for a grounded sphere, the image
