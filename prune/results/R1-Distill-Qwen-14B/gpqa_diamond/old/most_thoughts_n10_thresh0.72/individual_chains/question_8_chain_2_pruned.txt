Okay, so I've got this genetics question about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let's try to break it down. 

The setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants for each and some double mutants. The resistance levels are given for each mutant and double mutant compared to the wild type. The wild type is 100% resistant, so lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

The question is about figuring out the relationships between these genes, specifically whether they are transcription factors, have pleiotropy, redundancy, or epistasis.

I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that can indicate epistasis. For example, if g1g2 has the same resistance as g2, then G2 might be epistatic over G1.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But here, the traits are different levels of resistance. Hmm, not sure if that's directly applicable, but maybe if a gene affects multiple genes' expressions.

Gene redundancy is when two or more genes have overlapping functions, such that knocking out both doesn't change the phenotype more than knocking out one.

Now, looking at the data:

Wild type: 100% (control)
g1:75% → less resistance than wild type. So, G1's product is helpful for resistance, but not essential. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%.
g2:0% → No resistance at all. So, G2 seems crucial. Without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen.
g3:50% → So, G3 also contributes, but not as much as G2.
Double mutants:
g1g3:10% → way worse than either single mutant.
g2g3:0% → same as g2.
g1g2:0% → same as g2.

Wait, so when G2 is knocked out (g2), all the double mutants (g1g2, g2g3) have 0% resistance. So, regardless of whether G1 or G3 is also knocked out, the resistance is as bad as g2. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then without G2, those downstream genes can't function. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the effect is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That's because G2's role is upstream.

Wait, but what about the double mutant g1g3? That's 10% resistance. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single mutant. So, they might be redundant or additive. 

But wait, g3 alone is 50%, and g1 is 75%. So, knocking out both brings it down to 10%, which is less than either. So, maybe G1 and G3 are additive, or they have some other function where their combined loss is more severe. 

So, if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then knocking out G2 would disable both G1 and G3, leading to no resistance (0%). 

Looking at the options, let's see which ones fit. 

Option A says G1 is a TF. But in the data, g2 has 0% resistance, which suggests G2 is more critical, so likely G2 is the TF. So A might not be correct.

Option B says G2 is the TF, which makes sense. It says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Hmm, same promoter would mean they are co-regulated or something. Not sure about that. Also, G3 is epistatic towards G1. Wait, in the double mutants, when G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps G3 is epistatic? Not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Hmm, I thought pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but here it's about their effect on resistance. Maybe their loss affects the same pathway. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G
