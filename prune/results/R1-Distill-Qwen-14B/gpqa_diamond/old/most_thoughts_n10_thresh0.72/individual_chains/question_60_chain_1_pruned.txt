Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a super fast spacecraft traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens live about 150 years on average. They're sending an astronaut who's 22 years old. The question is, from the astronaut's point of view, how long will the trip take? And the options are about whether the astronaut dies or not, or how many years.

Wait, the astronaut's own experienced time is what matters here. Because when you're moving at speeds close to light speed, time dilation happens. From Earth's frame, the trip would take a certain amount of time, but from the astronaut's frame, the time is different because of the effects of relativity.

But wait, the problem says the spacecraft is going at a substantial fraction of c, so relativistic effects are definitely in play. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference—in this case, the astronaut's frame. To calculate that, I think I need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity.

The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where τ is the proper time, t is the time measured in the Earth frame, and v is the velocity of the spacecraft. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, I might be mixing up the frames here.

Wait, the Earth is at rest, and the spacecraft is moving towards it at 0.99999987c. So from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving very fast, but from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is approaching at that speed.

But to find the time the astronaut experiences, I need to compute the proper time for their journey.

But first, I need to figure out how far the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Earth. Oh, wait, the question doesn't give that distance. Hmm, that's a problem. Because without knowing the distance, I can't compute the time. Unless I'm supposed to assume that the distance is such that the trip would take a certain time from Earth's perspective.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to think about the time it takes for the spacecraft to reach Earth, but from the astronaut
