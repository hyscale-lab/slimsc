Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an atom that has a certain probability of decaying within a specific time. The question gives me that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, if I have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed, and 68% would remain. But wait, the question is about a single atom, right?

Now, in this case, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean the next 150 starting from now, so total of 200 minutes, or is it 150 minutes after the initial 100? Hmm, I think the way it's written, the 50 minutes have passed since the start, so the remaining time is 150 more minutes. So the total time from the beginning would be 200 minutes, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Maybe I should think about it in terms of the decay process.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. The probability of decay depends on the time elapsed. The formula for the number of undecayed atoms N(t) is N0 multiplied by e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant and t is the time. But since we're dealing with probabilities here, maybe I should think in terms of the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after a certain time, and then find the probability that it decays after that.

Wait, another approach: the decay process is a Poisson process with no memory. That means the probability of decay doesn't depend on the time that has already passed. So, if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes shouldn't be affected by the past 50. Or does it?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The probability given is 32% decay within 100 minutes. So the decay constant 位 can be found from that. The probability that a single atom decays in time t is P = 1 - e^(-位t). So for t=100
