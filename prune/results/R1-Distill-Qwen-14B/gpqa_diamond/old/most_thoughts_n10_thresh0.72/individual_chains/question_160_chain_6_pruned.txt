Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when the number of sides N of the polygon is infinitely large. Oh right, that makes the aperture effectively a circular one because as N approaches infinity, a polygon becomes a circle. Wait, but the problem says it's an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length a. Oh wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So all sides are the same distance from the center, which would be a circle if N is large.

So the light is monochromatic, wavelength λ, coming along the z-axis. It creates a diffraction pattern in the far field. I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) and surrounding rings of minima. The first minima occur at an angle θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ/(π a), or wait, no, I think the formula for the minima in circular diffraction is a sinθ = m λ, where m is the order, but wait, no, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The single-slit diffraction minima are given by a sinθ = m λ, where a is the slit width and m is an integer (m=±1, ±2,...). But that's for a single slit, which is a different scenario. For a circular aperture, the situation is different because the diffraction is two-dimensional. The minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) occur at angles where the path difference leads to destructive interference.

Wait, the problem says that the apothems are the same length a. For a polygon with N sides, each side is at a distance a from the center. So when N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle with radius a? Or wait, no, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, not the radius. Oh! Right, the radius of the polygon is given by apothem * (1 / cos(π/N)) ), but for a large N, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so the radius is approximately a. So the polygon size approaches a circle of radius a as N becomes very large.

Wait, but wait. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem (a) is
