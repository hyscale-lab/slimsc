Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface in hyperbolic geometry, kind of like a sphere but in a different space. The metric given here is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator looks important. It's 4 - x² - y², which resembles the equation of a circle, right? Like, if x² + y² = r², so here, r² would be 4, making r=2. That makes sense because the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2.

I also recall that for surfaces, the area can be calculated using the metric. The general formula for the area element in 2D is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy, but since the metric here is diagonal (no cross terms), it's just (g_xx * g_yy)^(1/2) dx dy. But wait, g_xx and g_yy are the same because the coefficients for dx² and dy² are identical in the metric.

Looking at the metric, the coefficient for dx² and dy² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the line element squared is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr², but wait, no, x and y are coordinates, so maybe polar coordinates would help here. Alternatively, since the metric is written in terms of x and y, perhaps we can consider the 2D surface area.

Wait, the metric resembles that of a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in 2D would have a coefficient like a²/(something), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a metric on a hyperbolic surface.

Wait, I think the metric given is in the form of a 2D surface, so we can calculate the area by integrating the area element over the entire surface. The area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))²? No, wait, no. The determinant for a diagonal metric is just the product of the diagonal components, but since the metric is in 2D, the determinant would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) because there are two dimensions. No, wait, the metric components g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². But wait, no, the determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So determinant g = (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² = x² + y².

But wait, for the area element, we integrate sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no. Wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So in this case, sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - r²), since sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) is 32/(4 - r²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

But to find the total area, we need to integrate this over all x and y where the metric is defined. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So for the denominator to be positive, x² + y² < 4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2, centered at the origin, in the x-y plane.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. To evaluate this, it's best to switch to polar coordinates. So x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ. So substituting, the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

We can separate the integrals:

= (32) * ∫0^{2π} dθ * ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So now the problem reduces to computing the radial integral I = ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So I = ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-1/2) du.

Which is (-1/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du. The integral of 1/u is ln|u|.

So it becomes (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So:

= (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this would be (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ] = (-1/2) ( -infty - ln4 ) = (1/2)(infty + ln4). Which is positive infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. So the integral diverges. Because near r=2, the denominator becomes zero, leading to the integrand blowing up. So the area would be infinite?

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, perhaps this metric represents a pseudosphere with finite area, but the calculation suggests the integral diverges.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in my substitution or in setting up the integral.

Wait, the substitution: u =4 - r^2; du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes:

∫ r/(4 - r²) dr = ∫ (1/u) (-du/2) )

Limits when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral is (-1/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du = (1/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

Which is (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to 4.

As u approaches zero, ln u approaches negative infinity. So the integral becomes (1/2)( ln4 - (-∞) ) ) → ∞.

So the area integral becomes 32 * 2π * ∞ → infinity.

So the area is infinite?

Wait, but pseudospheres have finite area, don't they? Or am I confusing this with something else.

Wait, maybe the metric here is not for a pseudosphere but for a different kind of surface. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). That looks like a metric on a surface, perhaps a hyperbolic space. Let's think about the form of hyperbolic metrics. A standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (4/(1 + r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), but this is in polar coordinates. Alternatively, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²) for r < 1.

Wait, but our metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²) ? No, wait, because the given metric is in x and y, which would be like polar coordinates, so r² = x² + y². So the metric would be [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Ah, so comparing to the Poincaré disk model, which is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²) for r <1. Hmm, but the given metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²) = [32/(4(1 - (r²/4)))] (dr² + r² dθ²) )= 8/(1 - (r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So the curvature would be different.

Wait, but the key point is that the area integral is diverging here, implying that the area is infinite. But if this is a pseudosphere of radius 2, perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, but wait, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface, isn't it? Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, which has infinite area. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but in the options, option D is +∞. So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, why is the question asking about a pseudosphere of radius 2? Because in the Poincaré disk model, the radius of the disk is related to the curvature. For the hyperbolic metric, the curvature is proportional to the square of the radius. For example, the metric (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²) has curvature -1/(R^2), where R is the radius of the pseudosphere. So in our given metric, the curvature can be found.

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric. Because for a surface with metric ds² = E dr² + G r² dθ², the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 r G)) [ dE/dr * (r) + E' ... ] Wait, maybe it's easier to use the formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric components. Alternatively, perhaps from the metric, I can find the Gaussian curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Ricci scalar for the metric. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the area being infinite suggests that the pseudosphere has an infinite area, which would make sense because it's a surface of constant negative curvature. So the answer should be D, +infty.

So going back to the options:

A) 0 → No, the area isn't zero.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → That would give a function dependent on position, which doesn't make sense for the total area.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → Same issue as B.

D) +∞ → Which matches our conclusion.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) described by the metric 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

we first recognize that the metric is defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. The area element in this metric is given by \( \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is \( \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), and the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate this over the entire domain \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Separating the angular and radial integrals:

\[
A = 32 \cdot \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral evaluates to \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To compute the radial integral, substitute \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \). The limits change as follows: \( r = 0 \) corresponds to \( u = 4 \), and \( r = 2 \) corresponds to \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

As \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area is:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \infty = +\infty.
\]

This result aligns with the properties of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature and has infinite area. Examining the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the total area cannot depend on \( x \) and \( y \).
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, for the same reason as B.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area diverges.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

**Answer: D**
