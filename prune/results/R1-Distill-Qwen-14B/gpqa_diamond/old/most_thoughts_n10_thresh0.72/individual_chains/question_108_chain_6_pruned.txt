Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let's see. I remember that paramagnetism has to do with how materials are attracted to a magnetic field due to the alignment of their electrons' spins. But wait, the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom.

The setup is a magnetic field B along the Oz axis, and m is small. Oh, right, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. I think m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but wait, wait—that's the orbital angular momentum. Oh, but in paramagnetism, the spin magnetic quantum number is more relevant. Oh wait, no—maybe the question is about the orbital part. Hmm. Or maybe it's the spin part? I'm a bit confused here.

The magnetic field is 1 Tesla, which isn't super strong but not negligible either. The problem gives a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers, which is the Balmer series for hydrogen, right? So that's the transition from n=2 to n=3? Or wait, no, wait. The Balmer series is when electrons drop from higher energy levels to n=2, emitting light in the visible range. The wavelength of 0.4861 μm is about 486 nm, which I think corresponds to the H-alpha line, which is the transition from n=3 to n=2. So the energy ΔE would be the energy difference between those two levels.

I need to find the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term compared to ΔE. So, I guess I need to calculate both terms.

First, let's find ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV for the ground state (n=1). The formula is E_n = -R / n². So, the energy difference between n=2 and n=3.

E_2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV.
E_3 = -13.6 / 9 ≈ -1.511 eV.
ΔE = E_3 - E_2 = (-1.511) - (-3.4) = 1.889 eV. Wait, but wait, when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits energy. So, the transition from n=3 to n=2 would have ΔE = E2 - E3. Let me compute that again.

Wait, E_n is negative, so E3 is less negative than E2. So when the electron drops from n=3 to n=2, it emits a photon with energy ΔE = E2 - E3.

So E2 is -3.4 eV, E3 is -1.511 eV. So ΔE = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = (-3.4 + 1.511) = -1.889 eV. But since we're talking about magnitude for energy, it's about 1
