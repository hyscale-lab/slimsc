Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron and protons making revolutions. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I need to think carefully.

Alright, let's start by understanding what a synchrocyclotron is. I remember that cyclotrons use a magnetic field to accelerate charged particles in a circular path. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, but I think they have some differences, maybe in how they apply the electric field for acceleration.

The problem states that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data: Φ0 is π/4, and U0 is 190 kV.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, I think in cyclotrons, the particles move in a circle and the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to their velocity. The electric field is applied alternately to accelerate them each time they complete a half-cycle. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted as the particle's speed increases, so that the electric and magnetic forces balance at each point.

But wait, perhaps I should recall the basic equations for cyclotrons. The time for one revolution is T = (2π m)/(qB), but that's when the speed is non-relativistic. But the kinetic energy here is 950 MeV, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects might be significant. Oh, but the initial kinetic energy is negligible, but after acceleration, it's 950 MeV. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Wait, but the problem says it undergoes two accelerations. So maybe each acceleration step adds to the energy. Wait, or perhaps each revolution they get a certain energy boost. But I might be getting confused with other types of accelerators.

Wait, I think in a cyclotron, the particle makes several revolutions before exiting. Each time it goes through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes, it's accelerated by the electric field. The number of revolutions depends on how much energy it gains each time.

But synchrocyclotrons might have a different setup. Let me think. The frequency of the applied voltage changes as the particle's velocity changes. The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So the frequency ν depends on α, which I'm not sure what that stands for. Maybe it's a function of the particle's momentum or something.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is set to match the particle's cyclotron frequency, which is when qB/(2πm) is the frequency. But synchrocyclotrons might adjust this frequency as the particle gains energy, hence the ν(α) term.

Oh right, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted so that the phase between the electric field and the position of the particle remains synchronized. So as the particle's momentum increases, the radius of its orbit increases, and the time for each revolution increases. But the frequency of the electric field is adjusted to match this, so each time the particle passes through the gap, it's accelerated.

Wait, but the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps each acceleration is a boost, and each boost occurs when the electric field is in the correct phase. So each time the particle comes around, it's hit with the electric field's peak voltage, but the timing is such that it's always accelerated when moving through the gap.

But I think I need to find the total number of revolutions the proton makes before reaching the kinetic energy of 950 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy gained per revolution. In each revolution, the proton gains a certain amount of energy from the voltage. Since the voltage is applied alternately, each half-revolution (each passage through the gap) gives a certain energy.

Wait, but in cyclotrons, the kinetic energy gained per turn is equal to the voltage applied. So each time the proton goes around the ring, it gains U0 volts. Wait, but wait, the voltage is peak at U0, but the average might be different. Or perhaps each half-cycle the electric field is applied, so each full revolution (two half-cycles) gives one acceleration. Or maybe each full cycle gives one acceleration?

Wait, no, I think each time the particle goes through the gap between the D-shape electrodes, it experiences the electric field. Since the electric field is applied in the gap, and the particle passes through twice per revolution (once on the way up, once on the way down). So each revolution gives two chances for acceleration.

Wait, but the electric field alternates, so the field direction is opposite each half cycle. So the particle is accelerated once per revolution, in a specific part of the gap.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think in terms of the energy gained per revolution.

In a cyclotron, the kinetic energy gained per revolution is approximately equal to the voltage applied. So, if the voltage is U0, then each revolution gives about U0 eV of energy.

But wait, in reality, the energy gain per revolution is U0 e, because each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains energy U0 (voltage) times e (charge). So each revolution gives U0 e energy.

Wait, but protons have charge e, so each time through the gap (which is once per revolution?), they gain U0 e energy. Wait, perhaps each revolution provides an energy gain of 2U0 e? Because they pass through the gap twice per revolution, each time experiencing the same electric field but in opposite directions. Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum energy gain per revolution is U0 e. Wait, but in a typical cyclotron, the potential is applied across the gap, and the particle is accelerated each time it passes through. Since the magnetic field causes the particle to move in a circle, each time it completes a half-circle, it passes through the gap once. So each full revolution would give two chances for acceleration. But how does the timing work?

Wait, the electric field is applied alternately, so the voltage is U0 cos(...) which varies with time. So the particle is accelerated when the voltage is at its maximum (since that's when the electric field is strongest). But the phase has to be correct so that the acceleration occurs when the particle is moving through the gap.

But perhaps that's not the main point here. The main point is that each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains energy equal to the voltage times e. So each revolution allows the particle to gain energy U0 e, or perhaps twice that.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the initial kinetic energy is negligible (T ≈ 0), and it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations would imply it only goes through the gap twice, which would make the number of revolutions small, but the options are in thousands. So that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says the proton undergoes two accelerations, but perhaps each acceleration is a step that happens over multiple revolutions. Or maybe it's two steps of acceleration, each step involving multiple revolutions. Or perhaps the term "two accelerations" refers to the fact that the magnetic and electric forces are used for both bending and accelerating, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the fact that the proton is accelerated twice, but that leads to a certain total energy. Let's think about the energy.

The energy gained per revolution is approximately U0 * e, but wait, the voltage is given as U0, which is 190 kV. So each revolution, the proton gains about 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV.

Wait, but the target energy is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. So how many revolutions would that take? 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000 approximately. But looking at the options, option B is 5300, which is close.

Wait, but wait, each revolution gives U0 e energy. That's 190,000 eV per revolution.

So number of revolutions N would be approximately (950,000,000 eV) / (190,000 eV/rev) = 5000 rev. So approximately 5000 revolutions.

Looking at the options, option B is 5300, which is close. But wait, perhaps I'm forgetting something. Because in a cyclotron, the radius increases as the particle gains energy, so the time for each revolution increases. So the frequency of the applied voltage must adjust to match the changing cyclotron frequency. But that might complicate the calculation.

Wait, but the problem gives the voltage as a function of time with a function ν(α). So perhaps the frequency ν is varying, but since the problem gives a specific U0 and Phi0, maybe that part isn't needed for the calculation, and we just use the energy per revolution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the fact that the energy per revolution isn't exactly U0, but depends on the relativistic effects. But 950 MeV is a significant fraction of the proton's rest mass (which is about 938 MeV/c²). So at that point, the proton is relativistic. So the calculation might be a bit more involved.

Wait, the relativistic kinetic energy is given by T = (gamma - 1) m c². So T = 950 MeV. The rest mass of the proton is m c² = 938 MeV. So gamma is (950 + 938)/938 ≈ (1888)/938 ≈ around 2.012.

Wait, that's a gamma factor of about 2. So the proton's speed is significant, but not extremely close to c. Hmm. So maybe the energy per revolution isn't exactly U0 * e, but perhaps adjusted for relativistic effects.

Wait, but wait, the energy gain per revolution in a cyclotron (or synchrocyclotron) is approximately U0 * e, but when the particle is relativistic, the momentum increases, so the radius of the orbit increases, which affects the time for each revolution. But the applied voltage's frequency is adjusted to match this, so the time for each revolution is such that the electric field is at the correct phase to accelerate the proton each time. So the energy gain per revolution remains roughly U0 e, because the frequency is adjusted. Therefore, the number of revolutions is simply the total energy divided by U0 e.

Wait, let me make sure. The energy per revolution is approximately equal to the maximum voltage times e. So the total number of revolutions N is the total energy (950 MeV) divided by (U0 * e in eV).

Wait, U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. So each revolution gives 190,000 eV of energy.

So N = 950,000,000 eV / 190,000 eV/rev ≈ 5000 rev.

Looking at the options, option B is 5300, which is close. But wait, why the discrepancy? Because perhaps each revolution doesn't give exactly U0 eV, but a bit less due to the phase factor or other factors.

Wait, the given voltage has a phase factor of Phi0 = π/4. Does that affect the energy gained per revolution?

Hmm, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν t + Phi0). The maximum voltage is U0, so the maximum electric field is U0. The energy gained per revolution depends on how much time the proton spends in the electric field region and the phase at which it enters. But if the phase is such that the proton is always accelerated when the voltage is at maximum, then each revolution gives U0 eV. But if the phase is off, perhaps only a portion of the voltage is used.

In this case, Phi0 is π/4. So the initial phase is 45 degrees. Does this affect the total energy gained? Or is it just a phase shift that doesn't change the energy per revolution?

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the total energy gained would still be the same because the average over a full cycle would still be the same. The phase shift would affect the timing of when the acceleration occurs but not the total energy per revolution.

So N=950e6 eV / 190e3 eV/rev = approximately 5000 rev.

Looking at the options, B is 5300. So that's the closest.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions is determined by the acceleration steps. Each acceleration step involves a certain number of revolutions before the proton is at the correct phase for the next acceleration.

Wait, but the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations. So maybe the voltage is applied twice, each time giving a certain boost. But that would mean the total energy is the sum of two steps.

But in that case, each step would give about 475 MeV, so each step would involve about 2500 rev. So two steps would be 5000 rev. But the options don't have exactly that. Wait, but option C is 3536, which is about half of 7072. Hmm, maybe my initial approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions per acceleration step is N_step. So two steps would be 2*N_step.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me think differently.

The energy gained per revolution is U0 eV. But wait, in reality, the energy gained per revolution is the voltage multiplied by the cosine term's maximum, so U0 eV. But perhaps the effective gain is U0/2 eV per revolution because the average voltage is U0/2? Or wait, the average of cos is zero over a full cycle, but the maximum is U0.

Wait, but the proton is only accelerated when the electric field is in the correct direction, which happens once per cycle. So each full cycle gives one acceleration. So each revolution gives U0 eV.

Wait, no, each full cycle is a full period of the voltage, which could correspond to two revolutions of the proton because the proton's frequency is different? Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the ratio of the kinetic energy to the energy gain per revolution, which is 950 MeV / (190 keV) = 950e3 / 190 ≈ 5000. So 5000 revolutions, which is close to option B (5300).

But why is the option not exactly 5000? Maybe because of the actual dynamics of the synchrocyclotron. Let me think about the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron.

In some references, the number of revolutions N is given by N = (gamma - 1) * (m * e * B)/(pi * U0). But I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the relation between the magnetic field and the frequency.

Wait, but I don't have any information about the magnetic field here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the ratio of the total kinetic energy to the energy gained per revolution.

So the total energy is 950 MeV. Each revolution gives 190 keV. So 950e3 keV / 190 keV/rev = 5000 rev.

But the options are 5300 (B) and 3536 (C). Why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the actual number is (gamma + 1)/(something). Wait, the rest mass is about 938 MeV, and the kinetic energy is 950 MeV, so total energy is 1888 MeV.

Wait, maybe the energy per revolution is not U0 eV, but something else. Let me think about the relation between the voltage and the energy gain.

The energy gained per revolution E_rev is equal to the voltage times the charge, but also considering the frequency. Wait, in a cyclotron, the time for one revolution is T = (2 pi m)/(qB). The applied voltage has a frequency f such that f = 1/(2 pi nu), but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, the voltage is applied at a frequency that matches the cyclotron frequency. So when the proton completes a revolution, the electric field is at the right phase to accelerate it again.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is adjusted as the speed changes, so that the timing is correct for each acceleration.

In any case, the energy per revolution is approximately U0 * e. So the number of revolutions should be the total energy divided by U0 * e.

But wait, perhaps the actual energy per revolution is U0 * e * (gamma), but when the proton is relativistic, the energy gain per revolution increases. Or maybe it's U0 * e / gamma.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the simple calculation of 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV/rev = 5000 rev, which would correspond to option B (5300) as the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact number is calculated using gamma.

Let me compute gamma again. Kinetic energy T = 950 MeV. The rest energy is m c^2 = 938 MeV. So gamma = (T + m c²) / m c² = (950 + 938)/938 ≈ 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.012.

So relativistic effects are minimal here. So the non-relativistic approximation should be okay.

So the number of revolutions N would be approximately T/(U0 * e) = 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV) ≈ 5000.

But the options don't have exactly 5000. The closest option is B)5300.

Hmm, why the difference? Because perhaps each revolution doesn't give exactly U0 eV, but an average.

Wait, maybe the actual energy per revolution is U0 * e * (1/(1 + (v/c)^2))^{1/2}, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is zero, so the first acceleration gives some energy, but each subsequent acceleration gives a little less because the proton's speed is higher, so the time in the gap is less, and the energy gained per revolution may not be exactly U0 eV each time.

But I think for the purposes of this problem, the intended approach is to compute N as T/(U0 * e), which gives around 5000, so the closest option is B)5300.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we start by analyzing the energy gained per revolution. The problem specifies that the proton is accelerated from negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) to a kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied in the accelerator is \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), with \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

In a synchrocyclotron, the energy gained per revolution is approximately equal to the voltage \(U_0\) multiplied by the proton's charge \(e\). Thus, the energy gained per revolution is \(190 \, \text{kV} \times e = 190 \, \text{keV}\). The total number of revolutions \(N\) can be estimated by dividing the total kinetic energy by the energy gained per revolution:

\[
N = \frac{T_1}{U_0 \times e} = \frac{950 \, \text{MeV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} = \frac{950 \times 10^3 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} \approx 5000 \, \text{revolutions}.
\]

The closest option to this calculation is \(5300\) revolutions. While the problem mentions two accelerations, this likely refers to the process of reaching the final energy rather than the number of revolutions. The phase factor \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\) does not significantly affect the total energy gained, as the voltage's maximum value \(U_0\) determines the energy per revolution.

Considering relativistic effects, the proton's total energy is \(T + m c^2 = 950 \, \text{MeV} + 938 \, \text{MeV} = 1888 \, \text{MeV}\), giving a Lorentz factor \(\gamma \approx 2.012\). However, this minimal relativistic correction does not significantly alter the number of revolutions, as the energy gain per revolution remains approximately \(190 \, \text{keV}\).

Thus, the total number of revolutions is approximately \(5000\), and the closest option is \(5300\).
