Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its albedo. Oh right, the formula I think is something like T = (L/(16πσd²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. But wait, in this problem, the albedo is the same for all planets, so maybe that factor cancels out when taking the ratio.

The problem says that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4. Since albedo is the same, I think the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio. Because, from the formula, T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2). So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (d2/d1)^(1/2) = 1.4, so d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 is about 1.96 times larger than d1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, T is proportional to (L/(σ d²))^(1/4), so T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2). So for T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). So if T1 is 1.4 times T2, then (d2/d1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So the distance of planet2 is 1.96 times the distance of planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Using the same logic, (d3/d2)^(1/2) = 2.3 → (d3/d2) = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So d3 is 5.29 times d2. But wait, because T2 is higher than T3 since the ratio is 2.3. So if T2 is higher, the planet must be closer to the star because being closer would make it hotter. So if T2 is bigger than T3, d3 must be larger than d2. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d). So yes, that makes sense.

So putting it all together: d2 = 1.96 * d1. And d3 = 5.29 * d2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * d1. Let me compute that. 5.29 * 1.96. Let's see, 5 * 2 is 10, but more accurately: 5.29 * 1.96. Let me calculate it. 5.29 * 2 is 10.58, subtract 5.29 * 0.04 (which is 0.2116), so 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684 approximately. So d3 is about 10.3684 times d1.

Wait, but that's the distance. Now the question is about the orbital period. I remember Kepler's third law, which says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star) divided by the mass of the star. So the formula is P² ∝ a³ / (M_star). But wait, in the problem, do we know anything about the mass of the star? Oh wait, the problem gives the mass ratios between the planets, not the star. Hmm. So the star's mass is probably much larger than the planets, but the problem doesn't give any info about the star's mass. So perhaps in this problem, the mass of the star is considered constant for all three planets, so when computing the ratio of periods, the M_star cancels out.

So Kepler's third law in more detail: P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) * a³. But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) * a³. So for each planet, P is proportional to a^(3/2). So the ratio of periods is (a2/a1)^(3/2), but wait, because P is proportional to a^(3/2), so P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2). But wait, in our case, the distances are d1, d2, d3.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the given ratios are between the planets. Oh, but wait, we have to find the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2).

Wait, because P is proportional to a^(3/2), and a here is the distance d. So yes, since d3 is approximately 10.3684 times d1, P3 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) * P1.

So let's compute (10.3684)^(3/2). Hmm, let's break it down. The square root of 10.3684 is about 3.22 (since 3^2 is 9, 3.2^2=10.24, 3.22^2=10.3684). So sqrt(10.3684) is 3.22. Then, 10.3684^(3/2) is (10.3684)^(1) * (sqrt(10.3684)) ) = 10.3684 * 3.22. Let me compute that. 10 *3.22 is 32.2, 0.3684 *3.22 is about 1.186. So total is 32.2 +1.186 = 33.386, approx 33.4.

Wait, but wait a second. The question gives the mass ratios between the planets, not the star. How does that factor in? Because Kepler's law depends on the mass of the star, but the problem doesn't give any info about the star's mass. So maybe the mass of the star is much larger than the planets, so M_planet can be neglected, meaning that the star's mass is approximately the same for all planets. So the mass ratios between the planets don't directly affect the orbital periods because the star's mass is dominant. So the given mass ratios might be a red herring? Or perhaps they are used for another part.

Wait, the problem statement says that the mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15. Similarly, M2/M3 is 1.35. So M3 is M2 /1.35, which is M3 = (M1/1.15)/1.35 = M1/(1.15 *1.35) = M1/(1.5525). So M3 is about 0.644 M1. But how does that affect the period?

Wait, Kepler's third law (simplified) is P² ∝ (a³)/(M_star). So if M_star is the same for all, then P² is proportional to a³. So the planet's mass doesn't come into play if the star's mass is much larger. So the mass ratios given here (between planets) probably don't affect the orbital periods. So the masses are given but perhaps not needed for this
