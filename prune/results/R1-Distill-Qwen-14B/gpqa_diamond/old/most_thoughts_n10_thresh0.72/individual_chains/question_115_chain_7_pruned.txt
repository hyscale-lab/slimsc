Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that electrons and positrons are matter and antimatter particles, respectively, and when they annihilate, they produce energy, usually in the form of photons.

The setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So I think I need to use conservation laws here—conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

Wait, but since they're annihilating into photons, which are massless, the total momentum after collision should be equal to the total momentum before.

Let me think about the initial momentum. Both the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis. So their momenta are in that direction.

The electron is moving left to right—so its velocity is positive in the horizontal direction. The positron is moving right to left, so its velocity is negative. But wait, the problem says the positron is moving from the right, so maybe its velocity is to the left, which is negative in our coordinate system.

Wait, the Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for each. The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So it's always greater than or equal to 1. 

For the electron: gamma_e = 4. So its relativistic momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, for the positron: gamma_p = 2, so momentum is gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But wait, positron and electron have the same mass, right? m_p = m_e = m.

But wait, their velocities are in opposite directions. So the electron's momentum is positive, and the positron's is negative.

So let's compute the initial momentum.

Electron's momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, positron's p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, let's define the electron's direction as positive. So the positron's momentum is negative.

Wait, but actually, their velocities are in opposite directions. So the positron's velocity is negative relative to the electron's. So, p_e = gamma_e m v_e (v positive), p_p = gamma_p m v_p (v_p negative). Let me get this right.

Wait, the electron is moving from left to right, so its velocity is positive direction. The positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative. So the total initial momentum should be p_e - p_p.

Wait, no: the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction, so its momentum is gamma_p * m * (-v_p). But that's a bit confusing. Let me write the momentum vectors. Let's assign the positive direction as the electron's direction—so to the right is positive. Then, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So the momentum of the positron is gamma_p * m * v_p, where v_p is negative.

Wait, but to find the magnitude, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnitudes and then consider directions.

Wait, the electron's gamma is 4, the positron's gamma is 2. Let me compute their relativistic momenta.

But wait, the magnitude of the momentum is gamma * m * v, where v is the speed. Since both are moving along the same line, their momenta are along that line, but in opposite directions.

Wait, but the direction of each particle's velocity is opposite. So the momentum vectors are in opposite directions.

So the total initial momentum is the sum of the two momenta, considering their directions.

Let me denote the momentum of the electron as p_e = gamma_e * m_e *
