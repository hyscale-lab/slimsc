Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, the problem doesn't give the orbital distances directly. Maybe I can find it using the radial velocity method or transit data.

Wait, the question mentions the Doppler shift from both planets on the [OI] line. Oh, right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational tug on the star. So the Doppler shift relates to the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit. 

The shift for Planet1 is 0.03 Å, and Planet2 is 0.04 Å. But how does that relate to the distance? I remember that the Doppler shift (v) is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for the RV method is v = (K) * sin(i), where K is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve. But if the orbits are coplanar and edge-on (since transit is possible), sin(i) is 1. So v = K.

The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin(i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3)

But wait, since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G M_p sin i ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) / (1/(1 - e²)^0.5)

Wait, but
