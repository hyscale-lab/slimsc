Okay, so I've got this question here about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they gave these to mice via oral gavage. From what I remember, oral gavage is a way to introduce substances into the digestive system, so the rotavirus would be in the stomach and intestines.

Then, they used in vivo imaging and saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, the stomach has a lot of acid, which can break down proteins. So the GFP-tagged proteins probably got digested there. But some made it through and got entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like the Peyer's patches, which are in the intestine. Peyer's patches are important for immune responses because they contain a lot of immune cells, including B cells.

They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cell population. So the cells in the Peyer patches are likely immune cells that have taken up the rotavirus particles. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes of these cells and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that the B cells have undergone some kind of diversification.

Now, looking at the options: The question is about which process is taking place.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. I remember that this process occurs in B cells after they've been activated. It's a way of increasing the diversity of the antibodies they produce. It happens in the germinal centers during the immune response. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, leading to more diverse antibodies.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the immune system's innate response. Complement proteins are involved in marking pathogens for destruction, like causing lysis or marking them for phagocytosis. But how does that relate to the variable heavy chain genes? I don't think complement activation itself causes variability in the genes.

Option C: Class switching recombination. Class switching is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), but it's a change in the constant region, not the variable region. So the variable regions are already determined; class switching doesn't add variability to them.

Option D: VDJ recombination. This is the process that happens during the generation of the initial B cell receptor. It's a way to create diversity by recombining V, D, and J gene segments. But VDJ happens during the development of the B cells in the bone marrow, not after they've been activated. So the high variability they're seeing might not be from this, since it's already happened.

Wait, but the question mentions that the cells are proliferating. So after the initial VDJ recombination, which gives each B cell a unique receptor, during the immune response, the B cells undergo further processes. Specifically, in the germinal centers, they undergo somatic hypermutation. This process introduces more mutations into the variable regions, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. That's why when they sequence the variable heavy chains, they see high variability.

So the process must be somatic hypermutation. The fact that they're in Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, suggests a mucosal immune response. The B cells there would be activated, leading to proliferation and somatic hypermutation.

The other options don't fit. Complement activation is more about the initial recognition and destruction. Class switching is about changing the antibody type, not the variable regions. VDJ is about initial diversity but not during the immune response after antigen exposure.

So the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the intestinal mucus and eventually the secondary lymphoid organs, including Peyer's patches. These patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability, indicating a process that diversifies the B cell receptors.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers. It introduces mutations into the variable regions of the B cell receptors, increasing diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response, involving the destruction or marking of pathogens. It does not directly contribute to variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the B cell receptor.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This generates initial diversity during B cell development in the bone marrow by recombining V, D, and J gene segments. However, this process occurs before antigen exposure and does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes during the immune response.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in activated B cells during the immune response. This process diversifies the B cell receptors, leading to the observed results.
