Okay, I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, so I need to find the energy that the nucleus is accelerated to reach that speed.

Wait, first I should figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6, right? So the mass I'll need is the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass of the individual protons and neutrons. Protons are about 938 MeV/c² each, and neutrons are about 939 MeV/c² each. But wait, actually, the exact mass might require me to look it up. Alternatively, I could use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass includes electrons as well. Oh right, the nucleus is Li-6, so I should calculate its rest mass.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron. Let me see. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass would be 3*(mass of proton) + 3*(mass of neutron). But wait, the mass of a neutron is slightly different from a proton. Yeah, the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c² and the proton is about 938.272 MeV/c². So I can calculate the total rest mass as:

Mass = 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) MeV/c².

Let me compute that. 3 * 938.272 is 2814.816 MeV. 3 * 939.565 is 2818.695 MeV. Adding them together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. So the rest mass is approximately 5633.511 MeV, which is about 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that the actual rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus? Because when you combine nucleons, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. So maybe the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons. Oh right, because when you form a nucleus, some mass is converted into binding energy, so the actual mass is less. So I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron without considering the binding energy. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Let me think. For an exam problem, perhaps they provide the mass or expect me to approximate it. Alternatively, maybe they consider the nucleus's mass as approximately the sum of its nucleons' masses.
