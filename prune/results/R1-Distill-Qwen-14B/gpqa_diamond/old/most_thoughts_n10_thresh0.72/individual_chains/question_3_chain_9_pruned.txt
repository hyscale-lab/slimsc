Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And we're told that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh wait, and the options are given as A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Hmm. So, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. For a linear combination of operators, the expectation value is the sum of the expectation values multiplied by their coefficients. So, the expectation of 10σz +5σx would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can calculate each expectation separately and add them up.

First, let me write down the state. The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, wait, but wait—do the coefficients add up to 1 in magnitude? Let's check: 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. 0.25 + 0.75 is 1, so yeah, it's normalized. Good.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz in this state should be straightforward. Because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively.

So ⟨σz⟩ is the probability of being in |↑⟩ times 1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times (-1). So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Squaring them gives the probabilities. So probability of ↑ is (0.5)^2=0.25, and ↓ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2= 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.0.

Now, for the σx part. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix. I remember that σx has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Specifically, the eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and |-x⟩ = (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

But wait, to find ⟨
