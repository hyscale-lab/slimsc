Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question has three parts, each a different Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products for each. Then, I'll match them with the options provided.

Starting with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. So, the reagents are sodium ethoxide and ethanol. I remember that sodium ethoxide is a strong base, often used to deprotonate things to form enolates.

Wait, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate. The enolate acts as the nucleophile. So, in this case, which is the Michael donor and which is the acceptor?

Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. It can easily lose a proton from the alpha position to form a conjugate base, which is a strong nucleophile. So, the dimethyl malonate will form the enolate, which will attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acceptor).

The acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this should be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: acrylate is CH2=CHCO-O-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be substituting on the middle carbon? Or maybe the alpha and beta are the first two carbons. Let me draw it:

Structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-O- group. So the substituent is on the third carbon of the acrylate? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the acrylate group is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So
