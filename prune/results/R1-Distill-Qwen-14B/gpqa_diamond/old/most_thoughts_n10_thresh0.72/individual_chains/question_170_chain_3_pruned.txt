Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that means the spin state vector is a two-component vector where the first component is 3i and the second is 4. So if I write that as a column vector, it's [3i, 4]^T. But wait, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors, right? So the state vector ψ is [3i; 4].

Now, the expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator. In this case, the operator is S_y, the spin in the y-direction. Oh, but wait, S_y is related to the Pauli matrices. I remember that the spin operator S for a particle like an electron (which has spin 1/2) is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ. So S_y would be (ħ/2) σ_y.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is given in the question as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Okay, so to find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Wait, no
