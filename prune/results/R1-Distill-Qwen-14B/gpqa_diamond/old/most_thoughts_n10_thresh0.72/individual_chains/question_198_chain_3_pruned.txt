Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, I should remember what stability constants mean. Stability constant (β) is a measure of the stability of a complex, with higher β meaning more stable. So, each β corresponds to a different complex.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2- where n is the number of SCN- ligands. Let's think about the possible complexes. For Co(II), which typically has a +2 charge, and SCN- is a monodentate ligand with a -1 charge. So the formula would be Co(SCN)_n^(2 -n), since each SCN contributes -1.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for a complex is M(L)_n. For Co^2+ and n SCN^- ions:

The charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 - n. So the complex would have a charge of (2-n). But I'm not sure if that's important for this problem.

But the key point is the stability constants given for each possible complex. The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think β1 is for the mononuclear complex, n=1, β2 for n=2, etc.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check: β usually represents the formation constant, Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. For example, for Co(SCN)_n^m, the formation reaction would be Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^2−n, and Kf is [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n).

But each β here is a stepwise formation constant, right? Wait, no, sometimes β can be cumulative. Oh wait, no, in some cases β is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for adding the second, etc. But I think in many cases, the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise constants. Or perhaps each β is the overall for each possible complex.

Wait, wait. The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, that suggests that each β corresponds to the complex with n=1,2,3,4 SCN- ions, respectively.

Wait, but wait, if β is
