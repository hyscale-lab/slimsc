Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy is involved here.

Alright, the problem says: There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about gravitational effects or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. The options are given in Joules, so I need to calculate it correctly and choose the right option.

Wait, so the setup is that 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is like the central charge, and the others are arranged around it. But wait, how are the 12 charges arranged? Since they are all at the same distance from P, maybe they form some sort of regular structure. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I don't need to worry about their arrangement. Because when calculating the potential energy of a system of charges, the total is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But maybe in this case, the configuration that gives the minimum energy is when all the other charges are as close as possible to the central charge, but wait, no, the distances are fixed. Oh, wait, the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, so their positions relative to each other can vary.

Wait, no, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So the distance between any of the 12 charges and the central charge (fixed at P) is 2m. But the distance between the 12 charges themselves could vary. So maybe to minimize the total potential energy, the charges should repel each other as much as possible, but because their positions are constrained, perhaps the minimal energy is determined by the configuration that minimizes the potential energy between them. Hmm, but wait, all the charges are positive? Because each is 2e, which is positive if e is
