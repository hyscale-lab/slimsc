Okay, so I have this problem here about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants is important because it tells us about renormalizability. Renormalizable theories have coupling constants with positive or zero mass dimensions, I think. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: the superficial degree of divergence is related to the dimensions of the coupling. If the superficial degree is non-positive, the theory is renormalizable. The superficial degree is calculated using the formula D = 4 - N_vertices*(dimension of each vertex). 

But maybe I should start by finding the mass dimension of κ. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I know that each field has a certain mass dimension. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the action is dimensionless, and the Lagrangian density has dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, wait. Let me see. The Lagrangian has units of energy^4 (since the action is dimensionless and Lagrangian is integrated over four dimensions). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So each term in L_int must have dimension 4.

So the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, which is a Dirac spinor (dimension 3/2), times σ_{μν}, which is a product of two gamma matrices and perhaps some structure. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which involves two gamma matrices. Each gamma matrix has dimension 1, so σ_{μν} would have dimension 2? Or wait, wait. The gamma matrices are dimensionless. Because the derivative ∂ has dimension 1. The covariant derivative is ∂ + ... so the term with ∂ would have dimension 1. So when you have terms like γ matrices multiplied by derivatives, the gamma matrices themselves must be dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is a product of two gammas, so it's dimensionless as well. Because each gamma is dimensionless.

Wait, but then the structure of σ_{μν} is just a product of gamma matrices, so it doesn't contribute any dimensions. So the term is κ times ψ̄, which is 3/2, times σ_{μν} (dimensionless), times ψ (3/2), times F^{μν}.

What's the dimension of F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or similar. The field strength tensor F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each derivative adds a dimension of 1, and A is a vector potential, which has dimension 1 (since the gauge field kinetic term is like (∂A)^2, which needs to have dimension 4). Let me calculate. The term (F^2) would be (∂A)^2, so each ∂A is dimension 2, so squared gives 4, correct. So A has dimension 1. Therefore, F_{μν} has dimension 2, because each derivative adds one, and A has 1, so (∂A) is dimension 2. So F is dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ * ψ̄ (3/2) * σ (0) * ψ (3/2) * F (2). Let's sum up the dimensions: 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, plus F's 2 gives 5. So the total dimension is 5. The term must have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian. So κ must have dimension (4 - 5) = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, that makes sense. So κ has dimension -1.

Now, the question is whether the theory is renormalizable. For a theory to be renormalizable, the interaction term's dimension must be less than or equal to 4. Because the superficial degree of divergence D must be greater than zero for the theory to be non-renormalizable. Wait, no, wait. D is given by D = 4 - sum (n_i d_i), where n_i is the number of vertices of type i, and d_i the dimension of each coupling. If D > 0, the theory is superrenormalizable (if D < 0, it's non-renormalizable). Or wait, another way: a renormalizable theory has couplings with positive or zero mass dimension because then the superficial degree of divergence is negative, meaning the theory is perturbatively renormalizable.

Wait, let me get this straight. The superficial degree of divergence D is calculated as D = 4 - (sum of dimensions of each coupling in the vertex). For each vertex, you take the dimension of the coupling constant and multiply by the number of vertices. So for each vertex, the dimension is [κ]_M. So for each vertex in a Feynman diagram, you have a factor of [κ]_M.

In this case, the coupling κ has dimension -1. So each vertex contributes ( -1 ) to the superficial degree D.

Wait, for a Feynman diagram with V vertices, the superficial degree is D = 4 - V * [κ]_M. Since [κ]_M is -1, D = 4 - V*(-1) = 4 + V. Since V is at least zero, D is at least 4, which is positive. That means the superficial degree is positive, so the theory is non-renormalizable because each loop contributes positive divergence, and you can't cancel it with counterterms of lower dimension.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when the dimension of the coupling is negative, it actually affects the superficial degree. Since each vertex contributes a negative dimension, but how? Let me think again.

Wait, the formula is D = 4 - sum (d_i * V_i), where d_i is the mass dimension of each coupling, and V_i is the number of vertices of type i. In our case, if the coupling has dimension [κ] = -1, and each vertex is a single κ, so sum is V * (-1). So D = 4 - (V*(-1)) =4 + V.

So D is positive for any V >=0. That means that the theory has superficial degree of divergence D positive, which implies it's non-renormalizable. Because in order for the theory to be renormalizable, you need D <=0. So if D is positive, it's non-renormalizable.

So κ has dimension -1 and the theory is not renormalizable. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C says κ has dimension -1 and theory not renormalizable. Option A says -1 and renormalizable. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the dimension of the coupling is [κ] = -1.

In four dimensions, a coupling with negative dimension implies that the interaction term has higher dimension. Because the term in the Lagrangian is [κ] * (fields), which must have dimension 4. So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4. We found [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =5, so [κ]= -1.

In terms of renormalizability, the interaction term has dimension 5 (since the Lagrangian must be dimension 4, and the term is dimension 5, so κ has dimension -1). But wait, in the standard classification, terms in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So any term with higher dimension (like dimension 5) must be multiplied by a coupling with negative dimension. Such terms are called non-renormalizable because they have higher dimension operators. The more negative the dimension, the higher the dimension of the operator.

So the theory includes higher-dimensional terms, which makes it non-renormalizable.

So the answer is C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density in four spacetime dimensions has mass dimension 4. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore also have mass dimension 4. 

- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2 (since it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has mass dimension 1).
- The operator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of two gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$ and $\gamma_\nu$, which are dimensionless.

Thus, the total mass dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must have mass dimension:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the superficial degree of divergence $D$ of Feynman diagrams is non-positive, making the theory perturbatively renormalizable. The superficial degree of divergence is given by:
\[
D = 4 - V \cdot [\kappa]_M,
\]
where $V$ is the number of vertices. Since $[\kappa]_M = -1$, we have:
\[
D = 4 - V \cdot (-1) = 4 + V.
\]
For any $V \geq 0$, $D > 0$, which means the theory is **non-renormalizable**. This is consistent with the fact that the interaction term has a higher-dimensional operator (dimension 5), which requires a coupling with negative mass dimension.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
