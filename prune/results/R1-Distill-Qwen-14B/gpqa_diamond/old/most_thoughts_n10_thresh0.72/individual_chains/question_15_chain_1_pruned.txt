Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, and I'm trying to figure out which one has a higher chance of transiting. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the setup: There are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit. The host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, blocking some light. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Wait, I think the transit probability formula is (R_planet / R_star)Â² multiplied by (a/(2R_star)) or something like that. Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability of a transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(2R_s)) ), but I might be mixing things up a bit. Or maybe it's R_p/(R_s + R_p) squared? No, wait, that's more for the actual transit depth. Hmm.

Wait, I think the probability P that a planet transits its star is given by the formula: P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(2R_s))? Or is it something else. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(R_s)), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about it differently.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a/(R_s)) divided by some other factors. Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the relative size of the orbit. The probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the star's radius, but squared? Or maybe it's the planet's orbital radius divided by twice the star's radius, multiplied by the square of the planet's radius over the star's radius. Let me try to recall.

Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (2 R_s)) ). Or perhaps it's (
