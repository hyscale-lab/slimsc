Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, first, the star has parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. But maybe those aren't super relevant here because the question is about the temperature and the Ti atom level ratios. Oh wait, the star's Teff is 6000 K without spots, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, that's a significant drop. So when spots are present, the star's overall temperature is lower.

The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when the star doesn't have spots. And the question is asking by what factor this ratio changes. So we're looking for the factor (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, and E2 > E1. So the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)), but wait, actually, let me get the formula right. The energy of level 2 is higher than level 1, right? So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = ΔE. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)). But wait, N1 is the number in level 1, N2 in level 2. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, so the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. If the temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio? Let me think. Let's say T is lower. So the exponent ΔE/(k T) is larger because T is
