Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's a column vector, right? So the state vector is a 3x1 matrix. The components are -1, 2, and 1. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that.

So the components are -1, 2, 1. The squares would be 1, 4, 1. Adding them up: 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh wait, that's 6, so the vector isn't normalized. Oh, right, I remember that the state vector must have a norm of 1. So maybe I need to normalize it first before doing anything else.

Wait, but the problem is about finding the probability of measuring 0 when using the operator P. So first, perhaps I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P, because in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation value, but I think for a specific value like 0, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to
