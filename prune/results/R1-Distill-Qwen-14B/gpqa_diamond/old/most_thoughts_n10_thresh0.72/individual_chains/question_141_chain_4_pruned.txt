Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think. First, I should probably draw the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, I think that's a typo. 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene? Wait, no, the 'd' might mean something else. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene? I'm getting a bit confused. Or perhaps the 'd' stands for something else. Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh, wait, maybe the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because 1 and 2 would be adjacent positions, and 4 would be across.

Wait, no, the original problem says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe the 'd' is a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Or perhaps 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Alternatively, maybe it's 1
