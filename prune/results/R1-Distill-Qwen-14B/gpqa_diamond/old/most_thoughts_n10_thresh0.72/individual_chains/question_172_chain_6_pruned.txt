Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

Alright, so the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation for population distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between those levels. The formula is N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where N2 and N1 are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, respectively, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the question says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So, for star_1, the ratio (N2/N1)_1 is 2. For star_2, (N2/N1)_2 is 1, or maybe lower? No, wait, the problem says "twice as excited", so I think (N2)_1/(N2)_2 = 2. Wait no, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, so the excitation level is twice as high. So, the number of atoms in the excited state (N2) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (N2)_1 = 2 (N2)_2. But wait, the total number of atoms is the same in each photosphere, right? Or maybe not, but perhaps the ratio is (N2)_1/(N1)_1 = 2*(N2)_2/(N1)_2? Not sure, maybe I should think more carefully.

Alternatively,
