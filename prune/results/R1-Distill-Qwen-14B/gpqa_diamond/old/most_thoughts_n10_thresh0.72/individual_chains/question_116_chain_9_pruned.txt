Okay, I need to figure out what compound D is based on the given reactions. Let's break this down step by step.

Starting with compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that the triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm usually indicates methyl groups adjacent to a CH2. And the quartet for 4H at 1.3 ppm suggests a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe compound A is a di-substituted alkane, like neopentane or something similar.

Wait, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane. Its structure is (CH3)C-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2? No, wait, I think neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is actually a central CH2 connected to two CH(CH3)2 groups. Wait, no, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is (CH3)3CCH2CH2(CH3)3? No, that can't be right. Maybe I'm getting confused. 

Alternatively, the NMR suggests two sets of protons: a triplet for 6H, which are probably three CH3 groups (each with 2 H?), but wait, each CH3 has 3 H. So 6H would be two CH3 groups. Wait, no, each CH3 is 3 H. So 6 H would be two CH3 groups, maybe in a structure like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe compound A is a di-substituted cyclopropane or a cyclohexane derivative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted ethane. Let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) suggests two equivalent CH3 groups attached to a CH2, because each CH3 would have a triplet if next to a CH2. The quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H) suggests a CH2 next to another CH2, perhaps as a -CH2CH2- group.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH2-(CH3)2? No, that would be more like a hexane derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of protons. 6H and 4H. So maybe the structure is (CH3)3C-CH2CH2-C(CH3)3? No, that can't be because that would have more protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution. Hmm, maybe it's 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane. Let me think about that.

Wait, but 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane would have two CH(CH3)2 groups. So the structure would be CH2[C(CH3)2]2. So that would give each CH2 group attached to two CH(CH3)2 groups. The protons on the central CH2 would be a quartet, because each is next to two equivalent CH(CH3)2 groups. But wait, each CH(CH3)2 would have three H, but as a triplet. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps compound A is 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane. No, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps compound A is a di-substituted cyclohexane. Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe it's better to think about the next part.

Compound A undergoes monobromination to form compound B. Monobromination could be an addition or substitution, but more likely it's a substitution in an alkyl halide. Wait, but if A is a di-substituted alkane, then the bromine could be added via free radical substitution, but it's more likely that it's an allylic or benzylic position, but I don't see much info. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethane, like neopentyl bromide. Hmm.

Wait, B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good nucleophile. So if B is an alkyl bromide, then C could be formed via elimination (E2 mechanism), producing an alkene. So if A is a di-substituted alkane, bromination would give a monobrominated product, which upon elimination would give an alkene.

So, let's consider that A is 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane. No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is 2,2-dimethylbutane. Let's see: 2,2-dimethylbutane is (CH3)2CHCH2CH(CH3)2. That structure would have two CH(CH3)2 groups in the middle. The protons on the CH2 groups (the central CH2) would be a quartet. And the CH3 groups would be triplet because each is next to the CH. Wait, but in 2,2-dimethylbutane, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2.

Wait, no, that's 2,
