Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me some setup and I need to figure out which statement is correct among the options provided.

Alright, let's break it down. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So the matrix S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

Wait, wait a second. That matrix looks familiar. Oh, right! That's the Pauli Y matrix, which is one of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are used in quantum mechanics for spin-½ particles, like electrons or muons. So the operator Ay is c times the Pauli Y matrix.

But wait, the Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σx, σy, σz. So S here must be σy, the Y Pauli matrix. So Ay is c * σy.

The problem says we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So, let's recall that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ± ħ/2. Wait, but wait, in this case, the operator is c multiplied by σy. So the eigenvalues would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of σy.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are ± ħ/2. Let me think—because σy is a 2x2 matrix, its trace is zero, and its determinant is -1. So the eigenvalues must be (± something) that squares to 1, but let's see, for σy, the eigenvalues are ±iħ/2? No wait, no, no, wait. No, wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Because when you compute the eigenvalues of σy, let's solve the characteristic equation.

The matrix σy is:
[ 0  -i
  i   0 ]

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0.

So determinant of [ -λ    -i
                   i   -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(
