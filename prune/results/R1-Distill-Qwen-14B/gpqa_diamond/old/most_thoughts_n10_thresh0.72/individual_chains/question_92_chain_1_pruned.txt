Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation... I remember that's the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, to find that, I probably need to use bond energies because I don't have any other information given.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me write it down to visualize better. It looks like a hydrocarbon with some double bonds. Let me count the number of carbons. Each (CH3)2C= part is a substituted double bond. Wait, perhaps it's a tri-substituted or di-substituted double bond? Not sure if that matters right now.

The data provided includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, that's the energy required to break a carbon atom into its constituent parts. Then, there are bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. So, all the bonds I need are probably covered here.

Wait, the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = [Sum of bond energies of reactants] - [Sum of bond energies of products]

But wait, no,
