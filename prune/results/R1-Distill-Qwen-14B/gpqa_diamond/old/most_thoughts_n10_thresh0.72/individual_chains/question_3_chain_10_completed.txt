Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x. I remember that expectation values are calculated using the state vector and the operator in question.

The particle is in a spin-half system, so the states are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of sigma_z. The given state is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is around 0.866. But let me make sure I don't approximate too early; I should keep it exact for calculations.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. I need to compute the expectation value of this operator. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

Since σz and σx are Pauli matrices, maybe I can separate the expectation value into parts. Because expectation values are linear, I can write this as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, the expectation value of σz is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

So, the probability of measuring spin-up is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. Spin-up corresponds to eigenvalue +1. The probability for spin-down is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = (3/4) = 0.75, with eigenvalue -1. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. I remember that σx is given by [[0,1],[1,0]]. The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are different from |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Since our state is expressed in terms of σz eigenstates, I might need to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ directly.

Let me write out the state in vector form. |↑⟩ is [1,0]^T, and |↓⟩ is [0,1]^T. So |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Now, σx is the 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So σx = [[0,1],[1,0]].

To compute ⟨σx⟩, I can do ψ† σx ψ.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Multiplying σx, which swaps the components, so σx ψ becomes [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]†.

Wait, wait, let me compute it properly. σx is applied to ψ:

σx |ψ⟩ = σx [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T.

Then ψ† multiplied by this gives:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * (0.5) = (0.5 * 0.866) + (0.866 * 0.5) → wait, but wait: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4, and same for the second term. So adding them together: 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, so ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. Let me double-check that calculation. Alternatively, another method: since the state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, and σx can be written as |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2 )⟨↓| ) (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑| ) (0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ )

Expanding this, the terms would be:

0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ → but ⟨↓|↑⟩ is zero.

Similarly, 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ → also zero.

The other terms: (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 * ⟨↓|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ → zero.

And (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ → zero.

Wait, maybe that approach isn't the best. Let me think again. So the calculation from the vectors:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] [[0,1],[1,0]] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

Multiplying the matrices:

σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

Then [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [ sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ] gives:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

Which is (0.5 * 0.866) + (0.866 * 0.5) → 0.433 + 0.433 = 0.866. So that's sqrt(3)/2 approximately 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Now, putting it all together:

The expectation value of the operator is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

From above, ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) = -5.

⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, so 5*0.866 is approx 4.33.

Adding them together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly. Because sqrt(3)/2 is exactly 0.8660254..., so 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*sqrt(3))/2.

So the total expectation value is:

10*(-1/2) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-10/2) + (5 sqrt(3)/2) = (-5) + (5 sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, but 5 sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 5 *1.732 /2 = 8.66/2=4.33.

So -5 +4.33 is indeed -0.67.

But wait, the question says 'expectation value up to one decimal place'. So -0.67 would round to -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck.

The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The probability for |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2=0.25, and for |↓⟩ it's (sqrt(3)/2)^2=3/4=0.75.

For σz, the expectation is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. That's correct.

For σx, the calculation via the vector approach seems correct. Let me compute it in another way. The expectation value of σx is (ψ|σx|ψ), which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 → (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

So 5 * 0.866 is 4.33. 10*(-0.5) is -5. So -5 +4.33= -0.67, which is approximately -0.7.

So the expectation value should be approximately -0.7, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | O | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring spin-up and spin-down are given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in \( |\psi\rangle \):
- Probability of spin-up: \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \)
- Probability of spin-down: \( \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75 \)

The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The state \( |\psi\rangle \) can be written as a vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle
\]
Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( |\psi\rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Now, compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
