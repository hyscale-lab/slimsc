Okay, so I have this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading through the problem carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the compound.

So the goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure. Let me look at the sequences they provided.

The intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon) and then continues. The mutants have changes in the first exon area.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, the third codon is different. Intact is TTT (Phe), mutant is TCT (Ser). Then later, the last part shows GTCGT becomes GTCGC. Wait, wait, no, in the given sequences, I should compare each part.

Wait, perhaps I should look for nonsense mutations (stop codons) which would truncate the protein. If the mutation leads to a stop codon early in the sequence, the protein would be shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

Alternatively, a frameshift could change the reading frame, but in this case, all the mutations are in the first exon, which is the beginning. Let me check each for possible stop codons.

The intact gene's first part is: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
The first few codons: ATG TTT becomes ATG TCT? Wait, no, the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT... in the intact gene. Mutant 1: ATG TTT becomes ATG TTC? Wait, wait, let me parse each.

Wait, the intact is written as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So let's break it into triplets:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Breaking into triplets:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA.

Hmm, so the first codon is ATG (same), second is TTT in intact, now TTC in Mutant 1. TTC is Serine (Ser). So that
