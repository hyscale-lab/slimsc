Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2 connected to a CH2 group with a double bond, right? So it's CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So it's CH2CH2CH3, but with the double bond between 1 and 2, so it's CH2=CHCH2- group? No, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is prop-1-en-2-yl: that would be CH2=C-CH2-. Wait, no, because the substituent is on the second carbon of propene. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's like CH2-CH2-CH2, but the first two carbons are double bonded. Oh wait, I've got it wrong. Let me write it down.

Prop-1-en-2-yl group: The structure is CH2=C(CH2-). Wait, no. The substituent is on the second carbon of 1-propene. So 1-propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is on the middle carbon (C2), which is CH2 attached to the double bond. So the substituent
