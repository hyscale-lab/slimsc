Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the "impulse" approximation used in many-body nuclear calculations. The scenario is that nucleons are behaving as if they're free. I need to find which of the four assumptions lead to this approximation.

The options are four statements (1 to 4), and the possible combinations are A to D. Let me go through each statement one by one to understand what they mean.

Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. Hmm, okay. So the interaction isn't considering any collective behavior or interactions between nucleons. It's like each nucleon is treated separately, which makes sense because if interactions are only with individual particles, they can be considered free in a way.

Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, what does that mean? Transparent in terms of interactions... Oh, right, like when a particle interacts with a nucleus, if it's mostly transparent except where it hits a nucleon, then the interaction is treated as if it's happening with a single nucleon. So the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction much. That sounds like the nucleus is treated as a collection of independent particles, each interacting on their own without affecting others.

Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmmm, this is about the internal structure. If the quarks are non-relativistic, then their motion is not at speeds close to light. I'm a bit confused here. How does that affect the approximation? Maybe because if quarks are non-relativistic, their binding is weaker or their internal motion is treated classically, which might simplify the model. Or perhaps it's implying that the nucleon itself is not being significantly affected during the interaction, so it behaves more like a free particle.

Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, that sounds like the nucleon isn't feeling any forces that hold it in the nucleus. So during the interaction, it's moving freely as if it's not bound. That definitely contributes to the approximation where nucleons act like free particles.

Now, the question is which of these statements together imply the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation is often used in scattering problems, I think. It assumes that the interaction is so brief that the nucleon can be treated as free during the interaction, so the internal structure and other nucleons' presence don't affect the outcome much.

So let's think about each statement in the context of the impulse approximation.

Assumption 1: Interaction only with individual nucleons. That fits because the approximation treats each nucleon independently. So yes, statement 1 is needed.

Assumption 2: Nucleus is transparent. That implies that during the interaction, the projectile (like a photon or another particle) only interacts with one nucleon at a time, and the rest of the nucleus doesn't contribute much. So this must be part of the assumptions. So statement 2 is included.

Assumption 3: Quarks are non-relativistic. How does this tie in? If quarks are non-relativistic, their binding is via lower-energy processes, perhaps. But I'm not entirely sure how that directly affects the impulse approximation. Wait, maybe this is about the internal motion of the nucleon. If the quarks are non-relativistic, the nucleon's internal structure is treated more simply, which might allow the approximation that the nucleon behaves as a point particle. Alternatively, if the quarks are relativistic, the nucleon's structure would be more complex, and interactions would involve more dynamics, but I'm not certain. This one is a bit unclear to me.

Assumption 4: Nucleon experiences no binding forces. That definitely contributes because the idea is that during the interaction, the binding is weak, so the nucleon behaves freely. So statement 4 is part of the assumptions.

Now, the question is which combination of these four statements includes the necessary assumptions.

The options:
