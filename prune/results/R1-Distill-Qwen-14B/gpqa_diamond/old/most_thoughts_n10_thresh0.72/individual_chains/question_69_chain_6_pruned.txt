Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y+ and Z−, and the proper lifetime τ0 is 8e-16 seconds. They're asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that particles moving at high speeds will have their lifetimes dilated due to time dilation in special relativity. So the lifetime we observe (the dilated one) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy.

Right, so gamma equals E / m. Here, E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately... let's see, 3.41 times 7 is around 23.87, so 7. Maybe 7.92? I'll do it more accurately: 27 ÷ 3.41. Let me compute that. Let's see, 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 27-23.87=3.13. 3.13 /3.41 ≈ 0.918. So total gamma is about 7.918. So gamma is approximately 7.92.

So the dilated lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ0. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 seconds. Let me compute that. 7.92 *8 is 63.36. So 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Now, the lifetime of the particle as observed is longer because of the high speed. But wait, how does this relate to the resolution needed in the bubble chamber? Oh right, the resolution is about the ability to measure the decay products' positions accurately. The minimum resolution needed probably refers to the length over which the decay products can be distinguished.

Wait, the minimum resolution delta would relate to the distance the particle travels before decaying. The distance is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. But since the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, I think it's better to use the relation between gamma and velocity.

Alternatively, the length L that the particle travels before decaying is velocity * lifetime (dilated). So L = v * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but v is approximately c when gamma is large, which it is here (gamma ~8). So v ≈ c. So L ≈ c * gamma * tau_0.

Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s. Wait, because gamma tau0 is 6.336e-15 s. So
