Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking for the normalized eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics can be represented as matrices, and their eigenvectors represent the states that the operator acts on by scaling them with the eigenvalue.

The operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) where each component is a matrix.

Let me note down the given matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, but the question is about the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, because a general direction can be represented as a unit vector n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, so maybe φ is zero here, but the problem says it's arbitrary in x-z. Wait, but for the eigenvector, maybe the direction n is given, but the operator is P·n, which would be a linear combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator P is along direction n, so the operator is P·n, which would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Oh right, because the operator in a specific direction is the dot product of the vector of components with the direction vector.

So if n is in the x-z plane, then the y-component of n is zero. Because the x-z plane implies that the direction vector has no y-component. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from z, and phi is the azimuthal. So if it's in x-z plane, phi is zero, so sin(phi) is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P·n would be sinθ * P_x + 0 * P_y + cosθ * P_z. So P·n = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

So the eigenvector we’re looking for is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector of the matrix (sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z) with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, each of P_x, P_y, P_z is already scaled by ħ/2. So let me write out the matrix for P·n.

Let me compute each part:

P_x is (ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So sinθ * P_x is (ħ/2) sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Similarly, cosθ * P_z is (ħ/2 cosθ)[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding them together
