Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The question says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Hmm, p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The problem is about their coupled angular momentum state, which is given as |1, 1, 2, -1>. I'm a bit fuzzy on what this notation means, but I think it's |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and M is its z-component.

Wait, so L is the sum of l1 and l2? Or is it the vector sum? Oh right, when you couple two angular momenta, the total L can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Since l1 and l2 are both 1, the possible L values are 0, 1, 2. So here, the coupled state has L=2 and M=-1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. Oh, so each Lz eigenvalue is mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number for each particle. So for each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1.

But wait, in the coupled state, the individual m's are not the same as the total M. Because M is the sum of the individual m's. So M = m1 + m2. In this case, M is given as -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But the question asks for both electrons to have Lz eigenvalues of -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because Lz |m> = mħ |m>, so if each m is -1, their Lz would be -ħ each.

Wait, but the state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. So when you measure L1z and L2z in this state, what are the possible outcomes?

I remember that when you have a coupled state, it's a linear combination of the uncoupled states, which are products of individual states. For example, |l1, l2, L, M> is a combination of |l1, m1> |l2, m2> where m1 + m2 = M.

So the given state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. For L=2, which is the maximum possible (since 1+1=2), the state is probably the highest weight state. But wait, when L is maximum (L= l1 + l2), the state is simply |l1, m1> |l2, m2> where m1 = l1, m2 = l2, but wait no, because that would sum to m = l1 + l2. But in our case, M is -1, which is not the maximum.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the basis states. The coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is a linear combination of the product states |m1>|m2>, where m1 + m2 = M.

Wait, but for this specific state |1,1,2,-1>, since L=2, which is the maximum, perhaps the state is a combination of certain m1 and m2. For L=2, the possible M values are 2,1,0,-1,-2? Wait, no. For L=2, M can be 2,1,0,-1,-2. So in this case, M is -1.

The state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = -1.

What are the possible (m1, m2) pairs
