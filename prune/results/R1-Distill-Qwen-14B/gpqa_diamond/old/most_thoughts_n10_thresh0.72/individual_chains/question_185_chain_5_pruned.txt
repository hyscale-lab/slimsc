Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. ε is an energy constant. I need to find the eigenvalues of this operator.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And when you take their dot product with a unit vector n, you're essentially doing a linear combination of these matrices weighted by the components of n. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

But wait, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix? Oh right, each Pauli matrix squared is the identity matrix. Like σ_x squared is I. So for any Pauli matrix σ_i, σ_i^2 = I. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is a combination of the Pauli matrices. Hmm.

Wait, but when you have an operator like σ · n, what is its square? Let me compute (σ · n)^2. Expanding that, it's (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). 

Multiplying this out, each σ_i σ_j term. Oh, but I know that σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. But if i ≠ j, the cross terms would involve the commutators. Wait, but when you square σ · n, the cross terms would be n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + ... and so on for all combinations. 

Wait, but wait another approach: the magnitude of σ · n. Since each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero and their squares are identity, maybe the trace of (σ · n)^2 is (σ_x^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2) since cross terms would involve σ_i σ_j which are anti-commuting and might average out when multiplied by n_i n_j.

Wait, (σ · n)^2 would be the sum of n_i^2 σ_i^2 plus the sum of n_i n_j
