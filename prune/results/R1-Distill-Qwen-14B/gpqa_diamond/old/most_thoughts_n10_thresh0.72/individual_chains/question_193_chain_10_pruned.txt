Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars ~ 1/parallax^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. The options are various powers of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Wait, first, I should remember what parallax is. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star due to the Earth's movement around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/distance (in parsecs, I think). Oh right, because distance (d) in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So, d = 1/plx.

Now, the problem says the number of stars (N) varies as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that as N = k/(plx)^5, where k is some constant.

But since I want to relate N to distance, I should express plx in terms of d. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So, plx = 1/d => plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So, substituting back into N: N ∝ d^5. Because 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so perhaps it's about the number density, like stars per unit volume or something. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit volume would involve more factors.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is, how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So, it's the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, perhaps? So, the number of stars in a region at distance r would depend on the area and the volume element.

Wait, I think the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of the region. But the question is a bit different. The number of stars is given as a function of parallax, so 1/plx^5. But we need to find how this number changes as a function of distance.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential number. Like, the number of stars in a small range of distance dr. So, how many stars are there at a distance r, and how does that number change as r increases.

So, first, let's express N in terms of d (distance). So, since N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/(plx) is d. So, 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So, N ∝ d^5.

But wait, that's just the number of stars at a certain distance. But stars are spread out in space. So, perhaps the number of stars at a certain distance depends on the volume of the spherical shell at that distance.

Wait, no
