Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Hmm, got it. Let me break down the information provided.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, a benzene ring has 6 carbons. So if it's di-substituted, that means two substituents are attached to the ring. But wait, the total is 8 carbons. Oh, right! Because each substituent contributes some carbons. So the two substituents together have 8 - 6 = 2 carbons. Wait, that can't be right because each substituent probably has more than one carbon. Wait, wait, maybe I messed up. Wait, the compound has 8 carbons in total. So the benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents. Let's say two substituents, so 6 + (x + y) =8, where x and y are the carbons in each substituent. So x + y = 2. Oh, so maybe substituents are each one carbon, like two methyl groups? But wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says di-substituted. So two substituent groups attached to the ring. But each substituent could have more than one carbon. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, right! The FTIR peaks indicate a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.), and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, let's think. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (maybe a ketone or aldehyde), and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). 

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl (like a ketone group,
