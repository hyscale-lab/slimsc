Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that when dealing with systems of charges, the potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble those charges. Since the system is isolated, we can consider all the interactions between the charges.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge at P. And the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same point, or arranged in some way?

Oh, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, I think that means each of them is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified. So, perhaps they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters, but their mutual distances vary. But wait, to find the minimum energy, we probably need to arrange the charges in such a way that the potential energy is minimized. Wait, no, in this case, the 12 charges are constrained, so maybe their arrangement is fixed, and we just need to calculate the potential energy between the charges.

Wait, no, wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so the other 12 are each 2 meters from P. So, each of those 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of them is a charge, so they would exert forces on each other, contributing to the total potential energy of the system.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy
