Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about epoxidation of alkenes followed by acid treatment. The chemist does two reactions:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, then aqueous acid.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, then aqueous acid.

Both reactions go to completion. Then the products are combined, and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is a peracid reaction where the alkene reacts to form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Wait, but after epoxidation, what happens when treated with aqueous acid? Oh right, acid catalyzed ring opening of epoxides. Epoxides under acidic conditions tend to undergo ring-opening via a two-step mechanism. The ring opens with the formation of a carbocation intermediate, and then nucleophilic attack occurs.

But wait, in the case of symmetric epoxides, like those from symmetrical alkenes, the ring opening might not lead to any new stereocenters because the epoxide is symmetrical. But for asymmetrical epoxides, the ring opening can lead to diastereomers.

Let me think about each reaction first.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons. So, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that. Octane is eight carbons, so oct-4-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the E and Z refer to the configuration around the double bond.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the correct structure for oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. Wait no, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5. Wait, maybe I should write the structure more precisely.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with double bond between C4 and C5. So, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be right. Maybe I should number it.

The correct structure would be: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 for octane. Wait, no. Octane is CH3(CH2)6CH3. So oct-4-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with double bonds at C4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure as follows: the molecule is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's oct-1-
