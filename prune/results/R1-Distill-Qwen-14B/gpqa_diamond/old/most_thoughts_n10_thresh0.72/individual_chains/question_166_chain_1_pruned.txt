Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Alright, let's start by looking at the Lagrangian given. The Lagrangian includes several terms. The first term is i times the conjugate of N_R gamma^mu partial_mu N_R. So N_R is probably a fermion field. The next terms are kinetic terms for the scalar fields: (1/2)(partial^mu phi)^2 and |D^mu S|^2. D^mu S is the covariant derivative, which suggests that S is a scalar doublet because it's in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, I think. Then there are interaction terms: -y_i/2 * phi * conjugate(N_{iR})^c N_{iR}^c, and another term involving the gauge fields and S. Oh, and also a potential V(phi, S, H). Wait, what's H? Oh wait, I think H is another scalar field because in the potential, it's V(phi, S, H). But in the given fields, phi is a singlet, S is a doublet, and H is probably another scalar. Or maybe H is part of the Higgs sector.

Wait, the problem statement says that the fields are singlet fermions N_iR with quantum numbers (1,1,0), which probably means (SU(2), U(1), hypercharge) or something like that. S is a scalar doublet (1,2,1), so SU(2) doublet, hypercharge maybe 1. Phi is a singlet scalar (1,1,0).

Wait, the potential V(phi, S, H) might be part of the Higgs potential, but H isn't defined in the given fields. Maybe H is the Higgs doublet from the Standard Model. Or perhaps it's part of the extended Higgs sector. Wait, the given fields include S as a scalar doublet, so maybe H is another field, but I'm a bit confused.

The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given as ⟨phi⟩ squared equals x²
