Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think aloud.

The question is about two reactions performed by a chemist using different reducing agents on unknown compounds A and B. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. I need to find out what A and B are.

Hmm, wait, so reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+, and reaction B uses BH3 and H+. The products are diastereomers, R and S configurations. I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent compared to BH3·THF, which is a milder one. But wait, wait, in the context of ketone reductions, both are typically used for ketones, but maybe in different conditions or for different functional groups.

Wait, no, actually, LiBH4 is more commonly used for reducing carbonyl groups like ketones and aldehydes. BH3, especially in a THF solvent (like BH3·THF), is also a reducing agent for ketones and aldehydes. But I think I've heard that LiBH4 is more selective in certain cases, maybe for esters or amides, but that's when you have other functional groups present.

Wait, but in this problem, both reactions are reducing something to give 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group that can be reduced to form that product. But wait, reducing a ketone would produce an alcohol, but in this case, the product is still a ketone. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: when you reduce a carbonyl group (like a ketone), you add two hydrogens. The product is an alcohol. But in this case, the product is a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an ester or another functional group that upon reduction gives a ketone?

Wait,
