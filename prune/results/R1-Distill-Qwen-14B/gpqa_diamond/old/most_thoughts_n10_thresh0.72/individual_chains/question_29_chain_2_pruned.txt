Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some gene mutation. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

So the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The person is using EMS mutagenesis to make mutants and then looks at the gene sequence in all mutants. They found changes in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene is given as a long sequence, and each mutant has a different change. The options are the four mutants, and I need to pick which one would most likely eliminate the compound.

I remember that anti-nutritional compounds are often proteins, so the gene likely codes for a protein. If the gene is not functioning, the protein won't be made. So, we want a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the entire downstream amino acid sequence.

Looking at the sequences:

The intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... and ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, looking at the first part. The intact has TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT. Mutant 1 has TTCTA CGC TGGTAC... Let me break it down. Let's see, the first part where they differ.

Original first part: Position-wise, maybe the 4th nucleotide. Let me count. Let's write the first part:

Intact: positions 1-20:
1  ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the changes are.

Wait, the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant 1's sequence starts as ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

So, looking at the first part, I see:

Original: ...TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant1: ...TTT CTA CGC...

So, comparing:

Original: TTTCTCGCTGGTACT
Mutant1: TTCTACGCTGGTACT?

Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so in the original, after TTT, it's CTC GCT GGT. In mutant1, it's CTA CGC GGT.

Wait, so the original has CT CGC TGG, while mutant1 has CT A CGC TGG? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is a substitution. Let me compare each position.

Wait, perhaps the first change is in the fourth codon. The original starts ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So the first few codons are Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT...

So the third codon in the original is CTC (Leu), in Mutant1 it's CTA (Leu again, since CTA is also Leu). Then the fourth codon in original is GCT (Ala), in Mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). So that's a substitution from Ala to Arg. Then the fifth codon in original is GGT (Gly), same in mutant. So, the changes here are in the fourth codon, from Ala to Arg.

No stop codon introduced, so this is a missense mutation. Not likely to disrupt the gene enough.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So, first few codons:

Original: Met Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr...
Mutant2: Met Phe Leu Ser Gly Thr...

Wait, let me see. Original: After TTT is CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr). In Mutant2, after TTT is CTA (Leu), then AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr). Wait, that's a big change.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the exact positions.

Original: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant2: ...TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So, the original has CTC (Leu) in position 3, then GCT (Ala
