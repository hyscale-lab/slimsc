Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I remember that Feynman diagrams are pictorial representations of the interactions between particles, and each diagram can have loops which indicate certain processes, like particles going into a loop or something.

The question is about figuring out how many loops the diagram has based on the "size estimate" formula provided. The formula given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Wait, I think the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process. Each loop typically contributes a factor that depends on the coupling constants and maybe some other terms. But how exactly?

I remember that the superficial degree of divergence relates to the number of loops. The formula for superficial divergence is something like D = 4 - L*(d-2), where L is the number of loops and d is the spacetime dimension. Oh wait, but that's for calculating whether a diagram is divergent. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (4π)^{-n}, where n is the number of loops? Or maybe each loop brings a 1/(16π²) factor, but that's more about the integral in loop calculations.

Wait, let's think about the general structure of loop integrals. Each loop integral in a
