Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the enthalpy of formation for this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure first. 

Wait, the formula is written as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So it's a carbon chain with some double bonds and branching. Let me count the carbons. Each (CH3)2C is a group, so maybe it's a symmetrical molecule. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure, but maybe that's not crucial right now. 

The question gives me enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is breaking all bonds in an atom to make isolated atoms. Then, the bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H are provided. 

Wait, the enthalpy of formation, ΔHf°, is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon, that's from carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas. 

So the general approach for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies of reactants (elements)] - [sum of bond energies of products (the compound)] 

Wait, no,
