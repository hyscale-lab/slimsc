Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters, some in 10^-15 and others in 10^-16. 

Wait, mean decay distance. I remember that particles decay, and their decay length depends on their lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula for decay length is c * τ * β, where τ is the proper lifetime, c is speed of light, and β is v/c. So I need to find τ, the lifetime.

The meson's lifetime is related to its width via the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, I've heard Γ is often the full width, so the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. 

But wait, units. Everything has to be in correct units. Let me jot down the steps.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. Γ is given in MeV, which is 320 MeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? Let me recall the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But since we're dealing with GeV, I think the value of ħ in GeV·s is about 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules, so converting units can get tricky. Alternatively, I remember that ħc ≈ 197 MeV·fm, but maybe that's for another formula.

So ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds. Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32. Let me do 6.582 / 0.32 =
