Okay, so I have this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about figuring out which two aromatic compounds are present in a mixture based on their NMR spectra. The compounds all have the molecular formula C10H14, which suggests they're substituted benzenes with methyl groups or maybe ethyl groups.

The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each at a 1:1 ratio. That probably means there are two distinct aromatic protons environments, each with equivalent protons. Then, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since 2.2 ppm is typical for CH3 groups attached to something deshielded, like maybe a benzene ring, these are likely methyl groups.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C10H14. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2). Assuming no X or N, so (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=4. So four degrees: likely a benzene ring (3 from ring, plus a double bond or another ring, but the other substituents would account for the rest. Since the compounds are aromatic, the ring is part of it.

Looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl. Let me list the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.
Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl.
Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethyl.
Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

Wait, but 1,4-diethylbenzene would have ethyl groups. Each ethyl is CH2CH3, so substituting two CH2CH3 groups on the benzene would add 4 carbons (each ethyl is 2 carbons, two ethyls make four). So the molecular formula would be C8H14, but the question says C10H14. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because each benzene with two ethyl groups is C8H10, but wait, let me check: benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5. So substituting two ethyl groups would make the formula C6H6 - 2H (since each substitution replaces a H) + 2*(C2H5) = C6 + 2*2 = C10? Wait, no, wait: no. Benzene has six C. Two ethyl groups are 2*(2 C) =4 C. So 6 +4 =10 C. For H: benzene has 6 H, each substitution replaces one H, so 6-2=4. Each ethyl is 5 H, so 2*5=10. So total H:4+10=14. So molecular formula is C10H14. Okay, so that fits. So option C has 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethylbenzene. So both would have molecular formula C10H14, that's correct.

Now, the NMR shows two singlets in the aromatic region. So each compound must have equivalent protons in their aromatic rings such that when mixed, they contribute to the two signals.

Wait, the question states it's a 1:1 mixture, so each compound contributes equally. For the aromatic signals: two singlets at 6.7 ppm, each in 1:1 ratio. So each aromatic proton environment is present in the same amount as the other.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (which is para-substituted? Wait, 1,2,3,4 would be adjacent positions, making a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution. That's like a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, perhaps a naphthalene-like structure? No, it's benzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution, which is a meta arrangement? Wait, numbering: 1,2,3,4 would be in a row. So the structure is a benzene ring with four methyl groups attached at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. So that's like a 1,2,3,4-tetra. But wait, that would make two adjacent methyl groups in some positions, leading to some equivalent protons.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetry of each compound. Symmetrical compounds will have fewer distinct proton environments. So the number of proton signals in the aromatic region depends on the substituents and their positions.

Let me take each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,3,4-tetra: The substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So the benzene has four methyl groups in a row. So the ring would have two adjacent methyl groups, then another adjacent methyl, then another. Wait, perhaps this leads to a structure where the two remaining positions (5 and 6) are H's. Wait, no, because 1,2,3,4 are four positions, so the remaining two positions (5 and 6) are empty. So the structure would be 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, which is a four-methyl group in a row, leading to some symmetry.

Wait, but in benzene, positions 1,2,3,4 are sequential. So positions 1,2,3,4 would mean that methyl groups are on each adjacent position. So the structure would look like methyl groups on 1,2,3,4, with positions 5 and 6 (across from 1 and 2) being empty.
