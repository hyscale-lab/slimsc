Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e, and they have negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges and potential energy, especially in an isolated system, we often use the concept of electric potential energy between charges. Since all the charges are identical, they will either all repel each other if they have the same sign. Since each charge is 2e, and e is the elementary charge (1.6e-19 C), each has a positive charge if e is positive, I guess.

Wait, the charge is 2e, so each is 2 times the elementary charge. So each is 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

The system is isolated, so no work is being done from outside except maybe the charges moving. But since 12 are constrained at 2 meters, perhaps they are fixed in a spherical arrangement around point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others arranged in a circle or sphere around it.

But wait, potential energy in a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So we can think of the total potential energy as the sum of each charge's contribution to the others.

But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so perhaps we need to calculate the potential energy of the 12 charges relative to the central one, and also the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, because in an isolated system, the potential energy of each pair contributes to the total. So for 13 charges, each interacting with every other, the total potential energy would be (1/2) * sum over all pairs, because each pair is counted twice otherwise.

Wait no, the formula for the potential energy U of a system of N charges is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum_{i<j} (q_i q_j)/r_ij.

But all charges are identical
