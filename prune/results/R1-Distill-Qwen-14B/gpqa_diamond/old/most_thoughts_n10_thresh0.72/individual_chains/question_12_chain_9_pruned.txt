Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are provided: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of kinetic energies.

Hmm, okay, so this is a particle physics problem, specifically about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they are neutral and have very tiny (possibly zero) mass. But in this case, since the problem doesn't specify, I think we can assume the neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to the muon's. So the neutrino's energy would be very high, but maybe in the problem, they're considering only the muon's kinetic energy and another's.

Wait, the question is to find the KE of the product particles. So both the muon and the neutrino have kinetic energy, but looking at the options, each option has two numbers, probably the KE of the muon and the neutrino. Or maybe the question is asking for the KE of each product, but considering that the neutrino's KE is very low? Or perhaps the neutrino's energy is not being considered, but I don't think so.

Let me think. In a decay like this, the pion is at rest. So, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so if it's moving, its total energy would be gamma* m_mu*c^4. Similarly, the neutrino, which is massless (approximated), would have energy equal to its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy (which is zero for neutrino), so just kinetic energy.

Wait, but in reality, neutrinos do have some mass, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can ignore it. Or maybe the problem gives enough data to proceed without knowing it.

So, since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu.

The total energy of the system is conserved. So,

E_initial = E_final

E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

E_final = E_mu + E_nu
E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )
E_nu = |p_nu| c (since m_nu is negligible)

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), let's say p is the magnitude. So,

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 )
E_nu = p c

So,

E_initial = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me write it as:

sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) + p c = m_pi c^2

But since we can work in units where c=1, let me set c=1 for simplicity.

So:

sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Let me call this equation (1). Let me denote m_pi = 139.6, m_mu = 105.7.

So equation (1): sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi

I can rearrange this:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p

Now, square both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p

Rearranged:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2

So,

p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi )

Let me plug in the numbers:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV

m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 ≈ 19,488.16 (MeV^2)
m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2 ≈ 11,172.49

So,

m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 ≈ 8315.67 MeV^2

Divide by (2 * m_pi) = 2 *139.6 ≈ 279.2 MeV

So,

p ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV

Wait, wait, but wait, units are in MeV. But p is in MeV/c, but since I set c=1, it's in MeV/c.

But when I calculate p, it's 8315.67/(2*139.6) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ approximately 29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

Wait, 139.6 squared is 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute 139.6^2:

139.6 *
