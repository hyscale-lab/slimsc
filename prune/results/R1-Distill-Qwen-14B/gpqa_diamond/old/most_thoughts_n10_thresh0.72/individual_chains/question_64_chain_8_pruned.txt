Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200 degrees Celsius without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were then passed through three tubes in succession: the first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper. 

The results were: the weights of tubes 1 and 3 increased by 3.60 grams and 0.80 grams respectively. Tube 2's weight didn't change. After that, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure. The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let me break this down. So the setup involves heating a mixture of two salts to produce gases, which are then analyzed by passing through different chemical tests.

First, I think I need to figure out what's happening in each tube to identify the gases. Let's look at each tube:

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant but it can also react with water. When it absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So if the gas passing through tube 1 caused it to gain weight, the gas must be something that reacts with Mg(ClO4)2, probably releasing water. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something that reacts with Mg(ClO4)2, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent. When it reacts with water vapor, it can form HClO4 and Mg(OH)2. So maybe the gas contains water vapor, which is absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2. The increase in mass (3.60g) would then be the mass of the water vapor.

Then, tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is something that reacts with Ca(OH)2, like CO2, it would form a precipitate, which would increase the tube's weight. But in this case, the weight didn't change. So the gas after tube 1 doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. That suggests that the gas after tube 1 doesn't have CO2 or SO2 or something that would react with Ca(OH)2. So maybe the gas is something inert, like maybe an inert gas, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a noble gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the gas after tube 1 would have passed through tube 2 without reaction. So whatever gas passed through after tube 1 didn't react with Ca(OH)2.

Then, tube 3: red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. Red-hot copper in the presence of a gas would react if the gas is something like H2, CO, etc. For instance, H2 would react with CuO upon heating, but wait, the copper is red-hot. So maybe the gas is H2, which would react with CuO to form Cu and water. Alternatively, maybe CO, but I'm not sure. Let me think: if the gas was H2, it would react with CuO (if present) to form Cu and water. But wait, the copper is in the tube, and when the gas passes through, maybe it's reacting in a reduction. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, which upon reaction with CuO (heated) would produce CO2 and Cu. Or perhaps it's a different reaction. 

Wait, the reaction of H2 with CuO: H2 + CuO → Cu + H2
