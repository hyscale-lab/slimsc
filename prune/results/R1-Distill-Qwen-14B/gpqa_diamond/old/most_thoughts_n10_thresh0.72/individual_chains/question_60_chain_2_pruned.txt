Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So the astronaut's own time (proper time) would be less than the time observed from Earth.

The question says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost light speed. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their perspective to reach Earth.

Wait, the problem mentions Earth is the destination, but where is Earth from the aliens' perspective? Oh, wait, the question says the aliens are in the Large Magellanic Cloud. So the distance is probably significant. But wait, the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, not the time from Earth's frame. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Oh no, no, the actual distance is probably not given. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.

The question says: how long will it take for their 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their own perspective. So the astronaut's experienced time is the proper time, which is less than the coordinate time (Earth's time). But wait, how do I calculate the time without knowing the distance? Because without knowing the distance, I can't compute the time
