Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions when there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh, and we're assuming ideal pH and temperature is 25°C.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form complexes. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so more of the metal is bound by EDTA.

But wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So, the Ca-EDTA complex is present in a 1:1 ratio, right? So, each formula unit of the complex has one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, in solution, that would mean [Ca-EDTA]^2+ is 0.02 M. But wait, we want to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions, not the complex.

So, the formation constant K is given. Let me recall the formula for the formation constant. For a complex like CaEDTA²+, the formation constant K is defined as:

K = [CaEDTA²+] / ( [Ca²
