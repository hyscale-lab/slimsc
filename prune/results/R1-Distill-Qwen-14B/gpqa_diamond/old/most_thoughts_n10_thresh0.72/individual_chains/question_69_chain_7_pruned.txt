Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem is about a decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X^0 decays into Y^+ and Z^- with a proper lifetime tau_0 of 8e-16 seconds. The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is dilated due to special relativity if they're moving at high speeds. So the observed lifetime, tau, is gamma times tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma depends on the velocity of the particle.

Wait, but the question is about the resolution needed. I think resolution here refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products. So the chamber must be able to detect the decay within a certain length so that it can see the products clearly. Otherwise, if the decay happens too far, the products might have moved apart beyond the detector's resolution.

So the key is finding the minimum length over which the decay can be detected. That would relate to the velocity of the particle and the lifetime. Let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma using the energy and mass of X^0.
2. Use gamma to find the velocity beta (v/c) of X^0.
3. Calculate the decay length, which is beta * gamma * c * tau_0.
4. But wait, the problem says we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh right, so the fraction observed is the efficiency, which depends on the decay length being within the detector's resolution. So perhaps we need to relate this to the proper decay length and the required efficiency.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this part. I think the fraction of decays observed depends on the ratio of the decay length to the detector's resolution. Or maybe it's about the proper lifetime and how much of the decay path is within the detector. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lifetime as observed in the lab is tau = gamma*tau_0. The distance the particle travels before decaying is L = beta * c * tau = beta * gamma * c * tau_0 = (beta gamma c tau_0). This is the mean decay length.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, perhaps the idea is that the decay length must be such that a certain fraction (30%) of the decays occur within the detector's resolution. Or wait, maybe the problem is that the detector has a certain resolution, say R, and we need to find R such that 30% of the decays happen within R.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the minimum distance the detector must cover so that 30% of the decays are detected. So, the fraction f is 0.3. The decay length L has a certain distribution, and we need L such that 30% of the decays are
