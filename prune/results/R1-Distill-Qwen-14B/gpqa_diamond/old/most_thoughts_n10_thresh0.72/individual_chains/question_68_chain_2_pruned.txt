Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think through it.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times S_z. So, mu = γS_z. Right, I remember that the magnetic moment is related to the spin angular momentum, and gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's moment is aligned with this field because, in a magnetic field, the magnetic moment tends to align with the field direction due to the Zeeman effect. So, the spin is along +Z, and the magnetic field B is along +Z. That means the particle is in the eigenstate of S_z.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, but if B is off, then the Hamiltonian should change, right? Because the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. If B is zero, the Hamiltonian would be zero, meaning no energy eigenstates. But wait, the problem says another magnetic field is turned on along +Y. Oh, so the field is now in Y-direction, same magnitude B. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B', where B' is along Y.

So now, the particle is subject to a magnetic field along Y. But since the initial state was an eigenstate of S_z, when the field changes, the state might not be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Because the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the state will evolve over time under this new Hamiltonian, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So <mu_z> oscillates. I need to find that frequency.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z. So mu_z would be gamma times S_z. So the expectation value of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.

So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>. So I need to find the frequency with which <S_z> oscillates.

But wait, when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y (since the magnetic dipole moment is mu = gamma S, so H =
