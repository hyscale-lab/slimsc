Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem says that an organic chemist does two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out the products of each reaction first. Let's start with Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but wait. The compound is a ketone, right? So the structure is hexan-3-one with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-... let me draw it.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but in this case, the 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So the structure is:

O
||
CH2-C-OCH3 attached to the 3rd carbon. Wait, no. The numbering would be from the other end? Let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, maybe it's CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-C(=O) in the middle. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. But the exact structure may not matter as much as the reaction outcome.

Reaction I: Treating with LAH. LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but what about the configuration? Since the starting material is an S configuration, will the reduction affect that? Wait, the ketone group is in the 3-position. The 5-position has a methoxy group.

When LAH reduces the ketone (at C3), it would add two hydrogens. So the product would be a secondary alcohol at C3. So the structure becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but does the reduction change the configuration of the adjacent chiral centers? No, because the ketone is a carbonyl, so it's a planar spÂ² hybridized carbon. When you reduce it
