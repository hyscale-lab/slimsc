Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They've been discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not too familiar with that, so maybe I should focus on the data given instead.

The problem states the equilibrium temperature ratios. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 is 1.4, and T2/T3 is 2.3. Wait, no, equilibrium temperature ratio—so Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's? Or the other way around? Let me double-check. Oh right, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4. So T1 = 1.4 * T2. Then T2 is 1.4 * T1? Wait, no, that might not make sense. So T1 is hotter than T2 by a factor of 1.4.

Wait, equilibrium temperature probably depends on the distance from their star, right? Because equilibrium temperature T is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula I remember is T = [(L / (16 π σ d²)) * (1 - a)]^(1/4), where a is albedo. Since albedo is the same for all planets here (0.3), that part cancels out.

So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4), which is (d^(-2))^(1/4) = d^(-0.5). So T ∝ 1/√d.

So the ratio of temperatures squared (since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), then T^4 is proportional to 1/d) would relate to the inverse of the distance ratios. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square.

Wait, let's think ratio-wise. Let me define T1, T2, T3 as the equilibrium temperatures. So T1/T2 = 1.4 → T
