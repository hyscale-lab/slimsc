Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let's try to think it through step by step. 

The question involves Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in what's called the Wurtz reaction, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the Wurtz reaction is between two alkyl halides, right? Or maybe it's more about the elimination of a molecule of HX. Alternatively, another reaction comes to mind—maybe it's a substitution or elimination. Wait, wait. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Or wait, no, no—wait another thought. Oh! Maybe it's about the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

But first, let's look at the data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR. Okay, let's start with the IR. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500, which is a broad range, possibly indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But the other peaks are 1720, which is probably a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid), and 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and maybe an O-H group?

Looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H) → Probably an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the O-H proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad due to hydrogen bonding.
- 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) → Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. So, maybe two protons as a doublet, which is typical for a para-disubstituted benzene where the substituents are in the para positions. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the coupling would result in doublets for adjacent protons.
- 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H) → Another set of aromatic protons, also as a doublet. So, this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, possibly with two substituents. Wait, but if there are two substituents, each at the para positions, then the protons would couple differently. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta arrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the aromatic ring has two substituents, one at the para position relative to each other. Hmm, but wait, wait—if the substituents are in the para positions, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.
Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H. That's typical for an aromatic ring with
