Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for each reaction. Hmm, let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is with 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reagents are THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. But wait, sometimes in such reactions, it's used for deprotonation. Then there's an H+ added, which might suggest some acid workup later.

Looking at the structure of the starting material: it's a spiro compound, which means two rings connected at a single atom. The spiro here is [3.5], so one ring is 5-membered and the other is 7-membered? Wait, no, wait. Spiro notation is the number of carbons in each ring. So [3.5] would mean two rings: one with three carbons (maybe a cyclopropane?) and another with five. But wait, the formula is 1-vinyl, so there is a vinyl group attached. The molecule has a double bond in the non-5-en part. So the structure is a bit tricky, but perhaps the key here is that it's a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group.

The reaction conditions: THF, KH. I think in such conditions, maybe the alcohol is deprotonated to form an alkoxide. Then, with a strong base like KH, perhaps an E2 elimination occurs. Wait, but what's the structure here? The starting alcohol is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the hydroxyl is on the spiro atom. Deprotonating it would give an alkoxide, which is a good leaving group? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves some kind of ring-opening or forming.

Wait, the reagents are THF, KH, and then H+. So maybe it's a deprotonation followed by a reaction. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact mechanism. Another thought: sometimes in such cases, especially with alcohols and strong bases, it's an elimination reaction. So maybe the alcohol would lose a proton and form a double bond, but in this case,
