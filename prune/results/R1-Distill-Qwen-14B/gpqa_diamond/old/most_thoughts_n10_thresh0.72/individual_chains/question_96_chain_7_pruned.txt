Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me try to unpack this. The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance to the galaxy, and asks for the order of magnitude of the entropy. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. I think the formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's constant ħ, gravitational constant G, Boltzmann's constant k_B, and the speed of light c. So, I'll need to find the area of the event horizon.

The event horizon's angular size θ is given as 10^-17 degrees. To find the radius, I can use the formula for the angular diameter distance. Oh wait, if θ is very small, I can approximate θ (in radians) as θ ≈ (diameter)/(distance). But wait, the angular size is the angle subtended by the diameter of the event horizon at the observer's eye (us, here on Earth). So, the diameter D of the event horizon is D = d * θ, where θ is in radians and d is the distance.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. So first, I need to convert θ from degrees to radians. Right, because 1 degree is π/(180) radians. So θ in radians is 10^-17 degrees * π/(180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. But wait, actually, since the numbers are so small, maybe it's better to keep it as 1e-17 degrees multiplied by (π/180) to get radians.

So θ_rad ≈ θ_deg * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17) * (3.1416/180) ≈ roughly 1.745e-19 radians.

The distance d is given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh, but wait, how big is a parsec? I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d in meters is 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

The diameter D of the event horizon is then D = d * θ_rad. So D = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that. 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 is approximately 3.086 * 1.745 = around 5.38, and the exponents 1e(26-19) = 1e7. So D ≈ 5.38e7 meters. So the radius R is D/2 ≈ 2.69e7 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. The event horizon radius is actually given by R = 2GM/c². But maybe I don't need that here because the angular size
