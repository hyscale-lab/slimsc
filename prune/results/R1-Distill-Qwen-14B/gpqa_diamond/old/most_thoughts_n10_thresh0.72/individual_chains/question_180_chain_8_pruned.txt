Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, they're each 2e, so each has a charge of 2 * 1.6e-19 C. So that's 3.2e-19 C per particle. 

The setup is a bit specific. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. But wait, how are those twelve arranged? Are they all on the same circle around P, perhaps? So like, they form a regular dodecahedron or something? Or maybe they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters. I think that's the case because it's the most symmetrical arrangement, but the problem doesn't specify their mutual arrangement. Hmm, but wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So maybe they're each at a distance of 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other might not matter for calculating potential energy. Or do they?
