Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, energy and momentum are conserved.

Wait, let me think. The pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the two products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the muon and the neutrino will have equal and opposite momenta.

Energy conservation says that the total energy before decay equals the total energy after. The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV because it's at rest. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. But wait, neutrinos are massless in these approximations, right? Or at least, their rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles. So the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, which is the same as its momentum times c squared, but since it's massless, E = pc.

So, setting up the equations. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, so the neutrino's momentum is -p because they must balance each other. So the muon's total energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, actually energy E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) divided by c squared? Wait, no, units might be tricky here. Maybe I should work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.

Assuming c=1, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). The neutrino's energy is |p|, since E = |p| for massless particles.
