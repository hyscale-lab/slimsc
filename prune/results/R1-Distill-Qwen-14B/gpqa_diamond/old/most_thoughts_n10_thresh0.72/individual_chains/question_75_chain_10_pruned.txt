Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me go through what I know.

The researcher inserted the coding sequence for GADD45G into a plasmid, adding a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. After that, they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies and checked the expression, but the protein isn't overexpressing.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to see if there's an obvious issue in the coding sequence that would prevent proper translation.

First, let me break down the sequence. The plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then it goes through various codons. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons because those would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein and possibly no detectable expression.

Stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA. Let me scan the sequence for these.

Looking through the sequence:
- The first few codons: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA...
Wait, the first codon is ATG (start). Next is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again, GAT is aspartic acid, GTA is valine. So far, no problem.

Continuing:

Wait, looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

I'll go step by step through the nucleotides in triplets, keeping track.

Let me write out a few codons:

After start ATG, next codons:
TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTA (V), etc.

Looking for any TAA or TAG or TGA in the sequence.

Let me check the middle part. For example, the part after GATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Looking for TGA in the triplet. Let me see:

Looking at the triplet after ATG, each set of three.

Wait, the very end is ...CGAGTGA. So the last triplet is GAG TGA. TGA is a stop codon. So that's the last part of the coding sequence.

Wait, but the plasmid's construct is designed to include the coding sequence, so if the sequence ends with TGA
