Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about detecting neutral hydrogen clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, redshift... right, redshift (z) tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So if a quasar's light is absorbed by hydrogen, the absorption line we see will be at a longer wavelength than the rest wavelength because of the redshift.

The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. But when the hydrogen is moving away (due to the expansion), the observed wavelength λ_observed is λ_rest * (1 + z).

Wait, so for the absorption to be in the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength needs to be within the optical range. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400nm (4000 Angstroms) to about 700nm (7000 Angstroms). So the observed Lyman alpha line must be in this range.

Let me write down the formula:

λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)

We want λ_observed to be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms (since that's the upper end of optical, beyond that is infrared which ground-based telescopes can't see through the atmosphere easily, though space telescopes can). Wait, but actually, for the lower limit of redshift, we want the maximum redshift where the light is just entering the optical range.

Wait, wait. The Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms. For the absorbed light to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be in 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So let's compute the minimum z such that 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

But wait, no. Because if the observed wavelength is less than 4000 Angstroms (which is 400 nm, violet), but that's still within optical. Wait, no
