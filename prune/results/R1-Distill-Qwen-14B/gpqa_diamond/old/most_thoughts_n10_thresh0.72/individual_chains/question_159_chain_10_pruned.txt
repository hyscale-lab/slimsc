Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at around 790 nm, and below that, the flux drops a lot. Hmm, I remember that when objects are very far away, their light gets redshifted. Oh right, this is due to the expansion of the universe. So when we look at a quasar, the light we see is stretched to longer wavelengths if it's moving away, which is usually the case for distant galaxies because of the universe's expansion.

The question is about determining the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, given the parameters of the Lambda-CDM model. The current Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density is 0.3, dark energy (which I think is dark energy density) is 0.7, and the universe is flat.

Wait, what's comoving distance? I think comoving distance is the distance in a universe that's expanding, where the distance is calculated based on the scale factor. It's kind of like the distance between two points that were at rest with respect to each other when the light was emitted. So for a=1, which is the current scale factor, the comoving distance is what we're calculating here.

The peak at 790 nm... I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. If the quasar's emission has been redshifted to 790 nm, that suggests a significant redshift. Let me think, the rest wavelength is 121 nm. So the observed wavelength is 790, so the redshift z would be (790 - 121)/121 ≈ (669)/121 ≈ 5.53. Wait, but wait, actually redshift is calculated as (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121 ≈ 6.5289, so z ≈ 5.5289? Or wait, is the rest wavelength 121 nm, and observed 790 nm. So the formula is z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. So 790 / 121 is about 6.5289, so z is about 5.5289. So z is approximately 5.5.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the peak is from another line. Oh wait, the question says near infrared and optical. So 790 nm is near infrared, but perhaps it's the rest frame optical emission. Alternatively, perhaps it's the emission line that has been redshifted into the near infrared.

Wait, but maybe the peak is from the Lyman-alpha line. Or perhaps another line. Alternatively, perhaps it's not an emission line but something else. But I think the main point is that the observed wavelength is longer than the rest, so we can
