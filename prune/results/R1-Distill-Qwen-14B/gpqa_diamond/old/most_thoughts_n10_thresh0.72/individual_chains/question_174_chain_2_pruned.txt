Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about atomic nuclei fission, right? So, an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic calculations) and the one calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D in MeV.

Let me jot down what I know. So, the initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments will move in opposite directions because of conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

The rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So, the total energy initially is just 300 GeV because it's at rest.

After fission, the two fragments have rest masses adding up to 99% of M. Let me denote the smaller mass as m1 and the larger as m2. So, m2 = 2 * m1. And m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. Let me solve for m1 and m2.

So, m2 = 2 m1. So, m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1 = 0.99 M. That gives m1 = (0.99 M) / 3 = 0.33 M. And m2 = 0.66 M. Wait, but I should probably calculate their actual masses in terms of the initial mass M.

Wait, but M is the initial rest mass, so M's rest mass energy is 300 GeV. But when it splits, the total rest mass is 0.99 M. So, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, but the sum after is 0.99 M c². Hmm, but in terms of energy, the initial is entirely rest mass, so 300 GeV is the rest energy. After fission, the rest energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the total rest mass energy is 297 GeV, but the initial was 300 GeV. So, there's a mass deficit of 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy and perhaps binding energy released, but in this problem, I think we can ignore binding energy as it's about the kinetic energy of the fragments.

Wait, but the problem says that the sum of the rest-masses is 99% of M. So, M_initial = (m1 + m2) + some mass converted into kinetic energy. Wait, but that's not quite the right way to think. Let me think in terms of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus their kinetic energies plus any binding energy, but perhaps in this problem, we can model it as the total energy being the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies.

But let's think about energy and momentum conservation. The initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after fission must also be zero. So, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. But since they have masses m1 and m2, and momenta p1 and p2, which are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, p1 = -p2. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2, but wait, because in terms of momentum, p = gamma m v. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to approach this using conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic way.

Let me write down the equations.

Conservation of momentum:
p1 + p2 = 0 → p1 = -p2.

So, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, and p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since p1 = -p2, we have gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to consider the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

For each fragment, the total energy is E1 = gamma1 m1 c², and E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

And the momentum p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = (gamma1 m1 c²) (v1 / c²) ) = (E1 / c²) v1.

Similarly, p2 = (E2 / c²) v2.

Since p1 = -p2, then (E1 / c²) v1 = - (E2 / c²) v2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere quickly. Maybe I can think about the fact that the two fragments move in opposite directions with velocities such that their momenta cancel.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the rest frame. The initial nucleus is at rest, so after fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.

So, for each fragment, the energy is E1 = sqrt( (pc c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ), and E2 = sqrt( (pc c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 ), because their momenta are equal in magnitude (p) but opposite in direction.

Wait, because p1 = -p2, but their magnitudes are the same. So, |p1| = |p2| = p. Hmm, but this would only be the case if the two fragments have the same speed, which isn't the case here because the masses are different. So, perhaps I should think about the magnitudes.

Wait, no, because momentum is a vector. So, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after is zero. So, p1 = -p2. So, their magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite. So, |p1| = |p2| = p.

But for each fragment, p = gamma m v. Wait, but since their masses are different, their velocities will be different unless their gamma factors adjust accordingly.

Hmm. Let me formalize this.

Let me denote the magnitude of the momentum as p for both fragments. So, p1 = p and p2 = p, but in opposite directions.

So, for fragment 1 (mass m1), p = gamma1 m1 v1.

For fragment 2 (mass m2), p = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since p is the magnitude, I can write:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But I don't know if that helps directly. Maybe I can express the velocities in terms of each other. Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the energy equation.

The total energy after fission is E1 + E2 = (gamma1 m1 c²) + (gamma2 m2 c²).

But the initial energy is E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

But also, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So,

m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m2 = 2 m1, as given, m1 = 0.33 M, and m2 = 0.66 M.

So, m1 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M, and m2 = 0.66 M.

But wait, 0.33 M + 0.66 M is 0.99 M, which matches.

So now, the problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and comparing the correct relativistic value with the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So, the kinetic energy is T = E - m c².

So, for fragment 1, T1 = (gamma1 m1 c²) - m1 c² = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

Similarly for fragment 2, but we don't need that, since the question is about T1.

So, the problem requires finding the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic approximation of T1.

In the non-relativistic case, when velocities are much less than c, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). So, the kinetic energy is approximately (1/2) m v².

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach yet.

Alternatively, the classical approximation might neglect the relativistic effects, perhaps treating the system as if it were classical mechanics, but I need to think about how that would be applied.

Wait, perhaps in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², treating v as non-relativistic.

But given that the nucleus is split into two parts, the velocities might be significant, so relativistic effects could be non-negligible, hence the need to compute the correct (relativistic) T1 and compare it with the classical T1.

So, perhaps the problem is asking for (T1_rel - T1_class), and the options are in MeV.

Let me think about the approach.

First, find the velocities and energies using relativistic mechanics, then compute T1_rel. Then, compute T1_class using non-relativistic KE formula, then find the difference.

But how?

Let me consider the system.

We have two fragments with masses m1 and m2 = 2 m1.

They have equal and opposite momenta, so |p1| = |p2| = p.

So, p = gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Because m2 = 2 m1, so gamma2 v2 = (gamma1 v1)/2.

But I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps we can work with the energy and momentum equations.

Let me denote the speed of fragment 1 as v, and fragment 2 as u.

Since momentum is the same in magnitude,

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

But m2 = 2 m1, so:

gamma1 v = 2 gamma2 u.

But I'm not sure. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are not equal, but we can express u in terms of v.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write
