Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations being equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. Oh right, the formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). 

In this case, the energy level in star_1 is more excited. So for star_1, the population is higher. Let me denote the energy levels as E for star_1 and maybe E is the same for both since it's the same transition, right? Because the problem states it's a specific energy level, so same E for both stars.

Wait, wait. The energy difference between the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J. So that would be the (E_high - E_low). Let me call this delta E as ΔE.

So for star_1, the population in the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2. According to the problem, n1 = 2 * n2.

So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. Using the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each star has its own temperature. So for star_1, the ratio of the excited state to the lower state is exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it
