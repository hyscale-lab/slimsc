Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I need to think it through carefully. Let's break down the question step by step.

The problem is about a mixture X that undergoes certain reactions. Let's list out the given information and try to deduce each part.

First, the initial mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, because they can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So, mixture X likely contains alkenes or alkynes, or perhaps a diene or something similar.

Then, when treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, mixture X undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, so different products are formed from the same starting material. Also, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the products after the reaction don't have the same functional groups that react with bromine. Since Y's components don't decolorize bromine, maybe the double bonds have been hydrogenated, but wait, the reaction is a disproportionation, not hydrogenation. Wait, but the reaction is done with Pt, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Hmm, maybe the reaction is a scenario where a di-substituted alkene undergoes a reaction that breaks the double bond, perhaps adding across, but since it's a disproportionation, maybe splitting into two different products.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y via disproportionation. So, the starting material in X is undergoing a change in oxidation state. So, perhaps an alkene is being hydrogenated in a way that leads to different products. But wait, if it's a single starting material, how does that lead to two products via disproportionation?

Wait, but wait. X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh wait, no, X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So, perhaps each of the two components in X undergoes a reaction when treated with Pt and heat, leading to different products. But the question states that the reaction is a disproportionation, which typically refers to a single species undergoing such a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about reaction conditions. Platinum is a catalyst, often for hydrogenation. So, maybe X is a mixture that upon hydrogenation (with H2?) forms Y. But the problem says that the treatment is with Pt when heated, which suggests H2 is present because Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation.

Wait, but the first line says the mixture X is treated with Pt when heated. Maybe it's hydrogenationâ€”platinum is used as a catalyst for hydrogenation. Oh wait, but the question doesn't mention H2 gas. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or some other reaction, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture where each component is a di-substituted alkene or alkyne. When hydrogenated (even if the problem doesn't mention H2, perhaps it's an addition reaction), each would add H2 across the double bond, but that's not a disproportionation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe one of the components is a cumulene or something that
