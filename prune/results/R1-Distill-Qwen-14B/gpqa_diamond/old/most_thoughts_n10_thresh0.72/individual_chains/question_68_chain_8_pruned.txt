Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. But since the field is turned off and then on again in a different direction, I think this involves some sort of transition or change in the system's state.

The particle's magnetic moment mu is gamma multiplied by Sz. Sz is the spin in the z-direction, so mu_z = gamma*S_z. The spin matrices for a spin-1/2 particle are well-known. For example, S_z is (Ä§/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_z.

But wait, the initial field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is aligned with this field. Since the magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, the initial magnetic moment would be along +Z as well. I think in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split, and the spin aligns (or anti-aligns) with the field. But when the field is turned off, the spin would be in a state that's a combination of up and down states, maybe?

Wait, no. Wait, when the magnetic field is applied along Z, the spin states are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to +mu*B and -mu*B, respectively. So if the field is suddenly turned off, the system's Hamiltonian becomes zero, so the state doesn't change instantaneously. But then the field is turned on along Y. Hmm, so the initial state is |+z>.

Wait, but the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment after the field is switched. So the initial state is |+z>, right? Because the magnetic field was along +Z, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. So when the field is turned off, the spin state doesn't change because there
