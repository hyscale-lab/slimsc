Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>]/N, where N is the normalization constant. The relative entropy is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I should find the normalization constant N. The formula for N is given: N = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). Let me plug in the given values. φ is -π/4, and alpha is 0.5.

So, sin(2φ) when φ is -π/4 would be sin(-π/2) which is -1. And exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-0.5) which is approximately 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065. Let me compute that: 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935), which is approximately 0.6275.

Wait, but wait. N is the normalization, so the state must have magnitude 1. Let me double-check: |cos(phi)|² would be cos²(φ), and |sin(phi)|² is sin²(φ). But since the state is a superposition, the normalization comes from the denominator. So yeah, N is correct as sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)).

Next, the state |ψ> is (cos(phi)|α> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Since phi is -pi/4, let me compute cos(phi) and sin(phi). Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |ψ> is [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

But wait, the state is a superposition of coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian states, but their superposition can be non-Gaussian, especially when they are in a superposition of two different coherent states with the same amplitude magnitude but opposite phases.

Wait, but the question is about non-Gaussianity. The relative entropy is used to measure how non-Gaussian the state is compared to a Gaussian reference state. Since the state is a superposition, it's non-Gaussian, but I need to compute del_b.

But wait, the relative entropy here is the difference in the von Neumann entropy of the state and the reference Gaussian state. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau).

But wait, no, the formula given is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). So that's S(rho) - S(tau). The non-Gaussianity is
