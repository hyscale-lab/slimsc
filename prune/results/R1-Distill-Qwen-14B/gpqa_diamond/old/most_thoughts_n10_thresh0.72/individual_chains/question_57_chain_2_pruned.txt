Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics involve things like phase shifts and the wavefunction properties.

The given phase shifts are delta_0 = 90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, delta_4=13. And we're told to ignore the rest. So, phase shifts beyond l=4 are zero, I guess.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = sum over l of ( (2l + 1)/(2ik) ) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * PL(cosθ), where PL is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right, along the incident beam direction means θ=0 degrees. Because that's the direction the particle is coming from.

So when θ=0, cosθ is 1. So the Legendre polynomial PL(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So each term in the sum becomes (2l+1)/(2ik) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1).

But wait, I'm only supposed to consider the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im[f(0)]. So let me compute each term's imaginary part and sum them up.

Let me write out each term:

For l=0: (2*0 +1) = 1. Divided by 2ik. Multiply by (e^{i delta_0} -1). So term is [1/(2ik)] (e^{i90°} - 1).

Similarly for l=1: (3)/(2ik) (e^{i67} -1), and so on.

Wait, but wait, I should compute Im[f(0)] which is the imaginary part of the sum of all terms. So each term contributes an imaginary part. Let's write each term as a complex number and then take the imaginary part.

First, let's compute e^{i delta_l} -1 for each l:

For l=0, delta_0=90 degrees. e^{i 90°}
