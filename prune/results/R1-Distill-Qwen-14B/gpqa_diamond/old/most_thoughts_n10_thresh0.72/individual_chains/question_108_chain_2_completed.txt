Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties of materials due to their electrons, and in this case, we're looking at the coupling term in the hydrogen atom under a magnetic field.

The setup is that the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz (the z-axis), and it's small, with B=1 T. Also, m is small, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem gives a transition energy ΔE with a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. I think that corresponds to the Balmer series in hydrogen, maybe the H-alpha line which is about 656 nm, but wait, this is 0.4861 micrometers which is 486 nm. Oh, that's the Balmer beta line, right? So the energy difference ΔE would be something related to that emission or absorption.

I need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with ΔE. So, I'm thinking about the Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field. The main terms are the kinetic energy, the electron-nucleus attraction, and the magnetic interaction terms.

The paramagnetic term comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic dipole interaction energy is H = -μ·B. And the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where m_s is the spin quantum number. Wait, but orbital and spin contributions—Hmm, in the presence of a magnetic field, the orbital angular momentum also contributes via the Zeeman effect. Oh right, the total magnetic moment is a combination of orbital and spin parts.

Wait, but the question specifically mentions the paramagnetic coupling. Paramagnetic effects are due to the electron's spin, but wait, sometimes the orbital contribution is considered too. Wait, no, I think paramagnetism arises from the spin magnetic moment. So the paramagnetic coupling would be the term involving the spin. But the question says orbital magnetic quantum number m, which is orbital. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, and m is its projection. So the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e)) * (ħ m l) / r^2. Or wait, I think the orbital magnetic dipole moment is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L_z)/(ħ) ) which simplifies to μ = (e/(2m_e)) L_z. So the energy from this would be H = -μ·B, so H = -(e/(2m_e)) * B * L_z. But L_z is ħ m, so H = -(e/(2m_e)) * B * ħ m.

But wait, the paramagnetic term is usually associated with the spin. Maybe I'm confusing the terms. Alternatively, let me think of the spin part. The spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is the gyromagnetic ratio (about 2) and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the energy from spin interaction is H = -μ_s · B = -g_s μ_B B m_s. But wait, in the case of paramagnetism, the interaction is indeed from the spin.

Wait, but the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term in the Hamiltonian, which would probably be the spin-orbit coupling? No, wait, spin-orbit is a different effect. Spin-orbit coupling is a relativistic effect where the spin interacts with the orbital motion, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, the problem is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which is the spin term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. So I need to compute the magnitude of the spin term and compare it to the energy difference ΔE associated with the given wavelength.

So first, let's compute ΔE. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is about 3e8 m/s. λ is 486.1e-9 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) ≈ 4.085e-19 J. To convert this to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 4.085e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, wait, wait, but wait a second. The energy levels in hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV. So the transition λ=486 nm is in the visible range. Let me think: the Balmer series is for transitions ending at n=2. The first Balmer line is H-alpha at 656 nm (n=3→2), next is H-beta at 486 nm (n=4→2), then H-gamma at 434 nm (n=5→2), etc. So, the transition in question is n=4 to n=2.

The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E_4 = -13.6 / 16 ≈ -0.85 eV, E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. The energy difference ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV, which matches the calculation from wavelength. So, ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Let me think: the Hamiltonian for the spin interaction in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment due to spin. So, the magnetic moment is μ = g_s μ_B m_s. Here, g_s is the spin g-factor, approximately 2. μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

The term H would be proportional to m_s, but since the problem states that m is small. Wait, no, m here is the orbital magnetic quantum number, right? Hmm, but the spin magnetic quantum number is s=1/2, so m_s can be ±1/2. So, the spin coupling term would be H = -g_s μ_B B m_s. So, the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to B times m_s.

Wait, but I'm getting a little confused. Let me think: the paramagnetic term arises from the spin. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by ΔE_para = g_s μ_B B m_s. So, the magnitude is |ΔE_para| = g_s μ_B B |m_s|.

Since m_s can be ±1/2, the maximum possible is 1/2 * g_s * μ_B * B.

Wait, but in the problem, the orbital magnetic quantum number is small. Wait, m is the orbital m, which is a different quantum number. Because for orbital angular momentum, m can be from -l to +l. So if l is small, then m is small. But how does that tie into the paramagnetic term?

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels due to an external magnetic field. In the Zeeman effect, the splitting is due to the orbital and spin contributions. The orbital contribution is proportional to m (the orbital m), and the spin part is proportional to m_s.

Wait, but the question specifically says "paramagnetic coupling term", which is the spin term. So the paramagnetic term is the spin part of the Zeeman effect. So the paramagnetic coupling would be the spin interaction, and the other part (the orbital part) is the diamagnetic term.

Wait, diamagnetic is when all electrons have their spins paired, so their magnetic moments oppose, leading to a weak diamagnetic effect. But paramagnetism is due to unpaired electrons, so in hydrogen, which has one electron, it's paramagnetic.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term is the spin term, which for hydrogen is H_para = g_s μ_B B m_s.

So, let's compute this. Let's take m_s = 1/2, because for hydrogen, the electron is in a state with spin up or down. So m_s = ±1/2.

So, the energy shift would be ΔE_para = g_s μ_B B m_s.

Plugging in the numbers: g_s ≈ 2, μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T, B=1 T.

ΔE_para = 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 0.5 (since m_s is ±1/2; taking the magnitude).

So, ΔE_para = 2 * 9.274e-24 * 0.5 = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert that to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

So, ΔE_para is approximately 5.79e-5 eV.

Earlier, we found ΔE (transition energy) is about 2.55 eV.

So, comparing the two: 5.79e-5 eV (paramagnetic term) vs. 2.55 eV (transition energy). So the paramagnetic term is much smaller. Wait, but wait: the paramagnetic term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field, and the transition energy is the energy difference between two states.

Wait, but in this problem, are we considering the perturbation due to the magnetic field compared to the transition energy? So the question is, which is bigger: the paramagnetic coupling term (which would be the energy shift due to the field) or the transition energy ΔE.

So, 5.79e-5 eV is way smaller than 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ (which is the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but wait: the question says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE". Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what exactly we're comparing. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states, say, between n=4 and n=2 in hydrogen. The paramagnetic term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field acting on the spin. So, for an electron in a particular state (say, n=2, l=0, m=0), the paramagnetic term would be H_para. So, the expectation value ⟨H⟩ is the shift in energy due to the magnetic field.

But the transition energy is the energy difference between two states. So, the question is about comparing the magnetic field-induced energy shift to the transition energy. So, the paramagnetic term is the H_para term, which is the energy shift, and the transition energy is the ΔE between two states.

So, the ratio would be ΔE_para / ΔE = (5.79e-5 eV) / 2.55 eV ≈ 2.27e-5. That's about 0.002% of ΔE. So, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So, in terms of order of magnitude, ⟨H⟩ (the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE. So, the correct option would be C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I make any mistakes in the numbers?

Calculating ΔE_para:

g_s = 2.

μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T.

B=1 T.

m_s = 1/2.

So, 2 * 9.274e-24 * 1 * 0.5 = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

Yes, that's correct.

And ΔE from wavelength is 2.55 eV.

So 5.79e-5 eV is much less than 2.55 eV. So, ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

So, the answer should be option C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (\(\Delta E\))**:  
   The wavelength of the transition is \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:  
   \[
   E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.085 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.085 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to the energy difference between the \(n=4\) and \(n=2\) levels in the hydrogen atom.

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\(\langle H \rangle\))**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling arises from the interaction between the spin magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The energy shift is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} = g_s \mu_B B m_s,
   \]  
   where \(g_s \approx 2\), \(\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\) (Bohr magneton), \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\), and \(m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2}\). Taking \(m_s = \frac{1}{2}\):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} = 2 \times 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \times 1 \times \frac{1}{2} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term (\(\Delta E_{\text{para}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}\)) is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy (\(\Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}\)). Thus, \(\langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E\).
