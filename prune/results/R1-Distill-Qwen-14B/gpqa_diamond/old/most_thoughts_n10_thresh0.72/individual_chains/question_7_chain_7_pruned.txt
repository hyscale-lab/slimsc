Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about when a gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon to produce an electron and a positron pair. The process is γγ → e+ e-.

The question is asking from what energy do these gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited by this process. The options are all in the GeV range, which is pretty high energy. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. 

So, I think I need to calculate the energy where the interaction rate becomes significant enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime. That probably involves some cross-section and the density of CMB photons.

Wait, I remember something about photon-photon interactions. The cross-section for two photons annihilating into electron-positron pairs depends on the energy of the photons. Oh right, the cross-section σ is proportional to (E^2), but maybe there's a formula for it.

The general formula for the photon-photon cross-section for e+ e- pair production is σ ≈ (E_γ^2) / (m_e^2) * some constant. Wait, wait, I think the cross-section σ is proportional to (E_γ * E_photon) / (m_e^2) * something? Or maybe it's (E_γ^2)/(m_e^2) multiplied by some function. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

I think the cross-section is given by σ = (8 π α^2)/(3 m_e^4 c^4) * (E_γ E_photon) (1/(E_γ + E_photon))^2) * something. Or maybe it's a function of the ratio of the two photon energies. Wait, no, another approach: the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by σ ~ (σ_T/4) (E_γ / m_e c^2)^2, where σ_T is the Thomson cross-section. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Let me think about the Thomson cross-section. σ_T is about 6.65e-25 cm^2, and m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV.

Wait, but I
