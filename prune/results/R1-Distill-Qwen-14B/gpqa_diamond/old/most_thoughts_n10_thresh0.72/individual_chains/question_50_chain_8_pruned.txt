Okay, so I have this question about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says that my colleague has a Feynman diagram with a "size estimate" written next to it, which is this string of constants and ratios: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the diagram is unreadable, but the question is about how many loops it contains. The options are A)6, B)2, C)1, D)3.

Wait, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process and the overall scaling of the amplitude. Each loop contributes factors involving integrals and constants, which often come with factors of (4π) raised to some power, and possibly other constants like alpha (the fine-structure constant) or coupling constants like g.

Let me break down the given expression. The term is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

First, I need to figure out how each part contributes to the loop count. The general form of an amplitude for a Feynman diagram with L loops is something like (coupling)^n * (other factors) * (loop integral factors). Loop integrals typically bring in factors of (4π)^{L} from the integration in momentum space, and maybe some other factors like 1/(16π^2) from the integral itself.

Wait, let me think. Each loop integral in four dimensions usually contributes a factor of (4π)^2 * μ^{4L} / (16π^2)^L, perhaps? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, each loop integral might come with a factor of (4π)^{d/2} or something like that, depending on the dimension. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I recall that for each loop, when you compute the integral, you often get a factor like ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4, which after some manipulations (like Wick rotation) becomes (4π)^{2} times some integral. So each loop contributes a (4π)^2 factor. But wait, when you have L loops, each loop might give a (4π)^2, so overall (4π)^{2L}.

But looking at the given term, we have 1/(4π)^6. So (4π)^{-6} is present. So that would imply that 2L = 6 → L=3. Because each loop contributes a (4π)^2 in the denominator? Wait no, wait. Let me re-examine.

In loop integrals, the typical expression is something like ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4. After some steps, this becomes (4π)^{-2} multiplied by some integral. Wait, but in dimensional regularization, the integral might look different, but in terms of the scaling with the number of loops, the (4π)^{epsilon} factors come in, but perhaps that's more about renormalization.

Alternatively, when you evaluate a loop integral in 4 dimensions, you often end up with a factor like
