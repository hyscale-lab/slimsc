Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think through each part.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with acetic acid and ending up with product 4. Then, we're supposed to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.

Alright, let's break down each step.

First reaction: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm. I remember that acetic anhydride is a good acetylating agent. Bromine in presence of pyridine often leads to a substitution reaction. Wait, acetic acid has an -OH group. So maybe this is an acetylation. Oh, right! The -OH in acetic acid would react with acetic anhydride to form an acetate ester. But wait, the reagents also include bromine. Oh wait, bromine is a good electrophilic reagent. Oh wait, maybe it's a bromination? Wait, acetic acid has a -COOH group. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts acetylation, but that's for aromatic rings. But acetic acid is a carboxylic acid; perhaps it's undergoing some kind of substitution.

Wait, another thought: Pyridine is often used to absorb HBr in reactions. So maybe acetic acid is being brom
