Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, right, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. These are also called enantiomers. So the question is asking which of the given compounds show this kind of isomerism.

The options provided are four different organic moieties. Let me go through each one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can have different isomerism possibilities. Biphenyl rings can rotate around the central bond, leading to different conformations. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that allow for non-superimposable mirror images, then there could be optical isomerism. Wait, but [1,1'-biphenyl] suggests that the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Now, the substituents here are at 2 and 2' positions on each ring, and 6,6' positions have nitro groups.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1', and the substituents are in positions 2 and 2' (so para positions on each ring) and at 6 and 6' (which would be meta?), but wait, on each benzene ring, position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (since numbering goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). So substituents at 6 and 6' would be in the meta positions relative to the connecting bond.

But more importantly, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some sort of stereogenic element, like a plane of symmetry that's broken.

Wait, but this compound is a dimethyl ester. The structure has two nitro groups at 6 and 6', and two carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'. Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and an ester group at 2. So each ring has substituents in the para position relative to the connecting bond. So when you have two substituents on each ring that are para, could that lead to a possibility of the biphenyl having a center of chirality?

Wait, I'm a bit shaky on that. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it wouldn't have optical isomers. Or maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, I remember that biphenyl compounds can exhibit optical isomerism if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule doesn't have an internal plane of symmetry. For example, if each ring has two substituents that are in positions that make the entire molecule chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 group at 2. So on each phenyl ring, the substituents are nitro (para to the junction) and ester (para as well). Wait, no, wait: the 6 and 2 positions on each ring. So, 1 is the connecting point. So position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (ortho), and position 6 is across from position 1 (para). So on each ring, substituents are at ortho (2) and para (6) positions relative to the central bond.

Wait, wait. Let me visualize this. Each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So if the central bond is at position 1, then each substituent is at 2 (ortho) and 6 (para). So for each ring, substituents at 2 and 6. Hmm, but wait, how does that affect the symmetry?

The substituents on each ring are the same: a nitro and an ester. But are the positions such that the molecule is symmetrical? If the two substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule can't be a mirror image of itself, then it would have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically across the central bond, then the molecule may not be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. So for each ring, substituents ortho and para to the central bond. Are these positions symmetric? Let me think.

Each ring has a nitro at position 6 (which is para to the central bond) and an ester at position 2 (ortho). So each ring has two substituents: one para, one ortho. Now, looking at the entire molecule, are the substituents arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetric or asymmetric?

Wait, if the two rings have substituents in the same positions, but on opposite sides, perhaps it would create a chiral molecule. Like, if the nitro groups are both on the same side relative to the central bond, or opposite sides.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, another approach: if the molecule has a center of chirality, then it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but biphenyls can have axial chirality—this is when the central bond is considered an axis, and the substituents on each ring can be arranged in such a way that creates a chiral axis. For example, the substituents on each benzene ring can be on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans). If that's the case, then the molecule can have enantiomers.

Wait, but in this compound, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 (para) and an ester at 2 (ortho). So in each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Now, considering the central single bond between the two benzene rings, this bond can allow rotation, but in certain cases, the substituents can be arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule would be chiral. I think if the two benzene rings have substituents arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral, then it can have optical isomers.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me think about whether this compound has any chiral centers or elements. The ester groups are OMe, I don't think they contribute to chirality. The rings themselves have substituents, but without a chiral center, it's the arrangement of the substituents on the biphenyl that's important.

Wait, I think that if the biphenyl has substituents that are not symmetrical around the central bond, axial chirality is possible. For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) of the central bond, but in this case, it's the same substituents on each ring.

Wait, each ring has a nitro and an ester group. So if the two rings have their substituents arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it would have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, because the substituents on each ring are the same (each has nitro and ester), maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no, because the substituents are in different positions: 2 and 6. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So when looking at the entire molecule, substituents at each ring are in 2 and 6, but the arrangement relative to each other could be such that the molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus lacks optical isomerism. Or maybe not. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Let me note that and move to the next compound, maybe come back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw this structure. Propanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid. So propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but as an ester. The structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think.

Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, but the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, wait, the structure is:

The propanoate ester would be: the acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), but when esterified, it's CH2CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so methyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the acid, and as the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the structure would be methyl ester, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3. So the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbon with the hydroxyl group: the CH2(OH) is actually CH2(OH), but wait, no. Let's see:

In the molecule, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH2-

Wait, no, wait, let me think. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the structure is HOCH2CH2COOH. So when you make the methyl ester, the -OH on the COOH becomes OCH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon of propanoic acid.

Wait, so the second carbon (from the COOCH3) is the one with the hydroxyl. So the structure is:

COOCH3 is on the first carbon, then CH2OH on the second, and CH3 on the third? No, wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the three carbons are CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is:

(CH2)CH2(OH) connected to COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons. The carboxylic acid is carbon 1: COOH is on carbon 1. Carbon 2 is the adjacent CH2, and carbon 3 is the CH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so carbon 1: COOH, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: CH2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the chain is:

CH2-CH2-COOH. So the carboxylic acid is on carbon 3. So the three carbons are: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH2), 3 (COOH). So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

When esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Now, look for chiral centers. The second carbon (CH2(OH)) is connected to:

- OH

- CH2-

- COOCH3

- and another CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, no, the second carbon in this case is a CH2 group. Wait, wait, no. Because the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be because the chain is three carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In propanoic acid, the structure is CH2CH2COOH. So the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: COOH.

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2.

So the structure is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

When esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the molecule is: the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH) on one side,

- CH2-COOCH3 on the other.

Wait, no. Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

- Carbon 3: CH2-COOCH3

Wait, but carbon 2 is a CH2 group. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons again.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So three carbons: CH2 (from CH3), CH2 (from CH2), and COOH.

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH, right?

So when you esterify it, you get HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, because the chain is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3,

Carbon 2: CH2,

Carbon 3: CH2(OH).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think in terms of the actual structure.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is:

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol, so the formula is CH(CH2OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOH.

So when you esterify the -COOH to -COOCH3, you get HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but that can't be right because the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So each carbon:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but Carbon 2 is a CH2 group connected to Carbon 1 (CH2(OH)) and Carbon 3 (CH2COOCH3).

Wait, but if Carbon 2 is CH2, then it's not a chiral center because it's connected to two same groups (CH2(OH) and CH2COOCH3). Or wait, no. Wait, Carbon 2 is CH2 connected to two CH2 groups. So, let me see:

Carbon 2 has:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right),

- One OH (on Carbon 1),

- One COOCH3 (on Carbon 3).

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the actual structure. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the three carbons are:

1: CH2(OH)

2: CH2

3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that's only three carbons. So Carbon 2 is CH2 connected to Carbon 1 (CH2(OH)) and Carbon 3 (COOCH3).

But wait, in reality, Carbon 2 would be connected to two CH2 groups, which are same. So in that case, Carbon 2 is a CH2, which is not a chiral center because it can't have four different substituents.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think differently. Do the carbons have four different groups attached?

Carbon 1: CH2(OH) → connected to two H's, one OH, and one CH2 (to Carbon 2). So the substituents are H, H, OH, and CH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, Carbon 1 is CH2(OH), so groups are two H, one OH, and one CH2- (to Carbon 2). So Carbon 1 is CH2(OH), meaning it's attached to two H's, an OH, and another CH2 group. So that's three substituents (since two are H). No, wait, Carbon 1 would have four substituents: two H, one OH, and one CH2 group (to Carbon 2). So that's four substituents, but two are same (the H's). So, for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So if two substituents are same (like two H's), then it can't be a chiral center.

So Carbon 1: substituents are H, H, OH, CH2- (to Carbon 2). So two H's, so not chiral.

Carbon 2: it's CH2, so substituents: two H's, one CH2(OH) (from Carbon 1), and one CH2COOCH3 (from Carbon 3). So substituents are H, H, CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3. So again, two H's; same substituents, so not a chiral center.

Wait, but wait a second. If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then Carbon 2 is CH2, so it's connected to two CH2 groups, making it not a chiral center. So, no chiral centers in this molecule.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Does the hydroxyl group's position allow for any kind of stereoisomerism besides enantiomerism? Or is there another possibility, like being a diastereomer in another context?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule can form an epoxide or something else, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-examine.

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (Carbon 2) has:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right),

- Two H's.

Wait, no, Carbon 2 is in the middle. So groups attached are:

- Left: CH2(OH),

- Right: CH2(COOCH3),

- Two H's.

So substituents are H, H, CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3). So two H's, so no, not four different substituents. So no chiral center here.

So, this compound (option 2) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait! 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as a beta-hydroxy ester. Beta-hydroxy esters can form cyclic acetals, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl group is in a position that allows for some kind of stereoisomerism without a chiral center. Wait, but without a chiral center, I don't think so. Enantiomers require a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. So if there's no chiral center, then no optical isomerism.

So, option 2 doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm. Or wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the molecule does have a chiral center. Let me think about the structure again. If the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH2-

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think of the structure as:

The central carbon is the one with the hydroxyl group. So, structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, in that case, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- One OH,

- Two CH2 groups,

- One COOCH3 group?

Wait, no. Let me think again about the structure.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So the three carbons are:

1: CH2(OH),

2: CH2,

3: COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

So, substituents on Carbon 2 are:

- Two H's,

- One CH2(OH),

- One CH2(CO-OCH3).

So, substituents: H, H, CH2(OH), CH2(CO-OCH3).

So two H's, so Carbon 2 isn't a chiral center.

Hmm, so I think I'm correct in saying that option 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Moving on to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is an aromatic ketone, with the structure Ph-CO-Ph. So, the molecule is a ketone where the carbonyl group is connected to two phenyl groups.

Now, can benzophenone exhibit optical isomerism? Well, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another type of stereogenic element, like a plane of symmetry.

Benzophenone has the structure where the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the carbonyl group). The structure is O=C(Ph)2.

The carbonyl carbon in benzophenone is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a trigonal planar geometry. It's not a chiral center because it's double-bonded and only has three bonds. So, no chiral centers here.

Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical. The two phenyl groups are identical, and the carbonyl is in the center, making the molecule symmetrical along the plane through the carbonyl group. So, benzophenone doesn't have any chirality, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. Wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis diacid, and fumaric acid is the trans diacid.

Wait, no, wait. Maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, with the two COOH groups on the same side (cis), while fumaric acid is trans, with the COOH groups on opposite sides.

Wait, but the actual structure of fumarate: the ester form. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid, so the structure is (CH2COOCH3)2 with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, the structure of fumarate (the acid) is HOOCCH=CHCOOH, but the double bond is trans, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides.

Now, when esterified with methanol, the structure becomes CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), but wait, no, the actual structure is (Z)- or (E)-?

Wait, wait, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-, no, wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans diacid, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides.

So the structure would be CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have any stereogenic elements that allow for optical isomerism?

Well, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each end. In this case, each end has a methyl ester group (COOCH3) and a hydrogen. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-butenedioic acid when it's fumaric acid. So the structure of dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-C-O-C-OCH3?

Wait, no, perhaps I should imagine the structure as:

The molecule is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is a diacid with a double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no, because fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). And since it's the trans isomer, the substituents on each double bond carbon are opposite.

So, each double bond carbon (the central two carbons) has a COOCH3 group and a CH2- group or another group?

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 as the diacid. No, no, wait, fumarate is the trans diacid, so the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and the substituents on each are H and COOH. So when esterified, the structure becomes (COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides.

So, the double bond is between the two middle carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH in the cis (which would be maleate), but no, wait. No, I'm getting confused between maleate and fumarate. Maleic acid is the cis isomer: HOOCCHCHCOOH with the two COOH groups on the same side. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer: the COOH groups are on opposite sides.

So, the structure of fumarate is (E)-HO2CCH=CHCO2H. When esterified to form dimethyl fumarate, the structure becomes (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

So, the molecule has a double bond with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. Now, in this case, does the molecule have any stereogenic centers or planes of symmetry?

Wait, the molecule has a double bond, and the substituents on each end are COOCH3 and another COOCH3. Wait, no, each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Or wait, no, the structure is:

Each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)CH2?

No, I think I'm complicating it. Let me think again.

The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, the molecule is:

O
||       O
O-C-OCH3    O-C-OCH3
   \       /
    C=C
   /       \
  CH3      CH3

Wait, no, that's not correct because fumarate is a diacid. Alternatively, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group attached.

Wait, no, each double bond carbon has one COOCH3 and one CH2 group. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3), but with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, that seems more accurate. So each double bond carbon is connected to a CH2(COOCH3) group and a CH2 group. Or perhaps each is connected to two CH2(COOCH3) groups, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecule as:

The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Carbon 1 is CH2(COOCH3), carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 and 3, carbon 3 is connected to carbon 2 and 4, and carbon 4 is CH2(COOCH3).

So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but that can't be right. Wait, no, because that's butane diol ester, not fumarate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the structure again.

Fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So when you esterify both COOH groups with methanol, you get CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the substituents on opposite sides.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no, because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH-CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration.

So each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group attached.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of substituents on each double bond carbon. Each double bond carbon (C2 and C3) is attached to:

- C1: which is CH2(COOCH3),
- C4: which is CH2(COOCH3),
- and in the middle, the double bond.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3) - CH2 - CH2 - CH2(COOCH3)

But that's without a double bond, which is incorrect. Wait, no, the double bond is in the middle. So, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two middle CH2 groups? No, that's not possible because that would imply a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), which is not possible with a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Dimethyl fumarate has a structure with a double bond and ester groups. The key point is whether the molecule has stereogenic elements that allow for optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to two ester groups. Wait, no, each is connected to one ester group and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has E and Z isomerism, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. But, wait, in this case, the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same. Because each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group attached.

Wait, no, each double bond carbon has two substituents: COOCH3 and CH2. So, for each double bond carbon, the substituents are COOCH3 and CH2.

But in the trans configuration (fumarate), the substituents on each double bond carbon are opposite each other. So, for example, on the left carbon, the COOCH3 is up and the CH2 is down, and on the right carbon, the COOCH3 is down and the CH2 is up.

Wait, but if each substituent is the same on both sides (COOCH3 and CH2), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Because flipping it would produce the same structure.

Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is:

COOCH3
|
CH2–CH2–CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond in the middle. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3), but trans.

In this structure, each end is symmetric. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the center of the double bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on each double bond carbon are different, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, each carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So substituents on each double bond carbon are same on both sides.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I remember that fumarate is a trans diacid, and when esterified, the molecule is symmetrical, so it wouldn't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: when a molecule has a double bond with substituents on each end that are the same, the molecule can exhibit geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but not optical isomerism. Because the molecule is symmetrical and doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each substituent on the double bond is a CH2(COOCH3) group on both ends. So, the structure is symmetrical, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Are there any chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate?

The molecule is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3), with the substituents on each double bond carbon being the same. So, each double bond carbon has a CH2(COOCH3) and a CH2 group, but no, that's not correct. Wait, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group attached, but in a trans configuration. So, the substituents are on opposite sides.

But wait, if each substituent is the same on each end, then the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Maybe I'm wrong about this. Let me think of another approach. I've heard that fumarate can have optical isomerism if the substituents are arranged in a certain way.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's achiral. For example, if you have two identical groups on either end of the double bond, the molecule would be symmetrical.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, each end is CH2(COOCH3), and the double bond is trans. So the molecule would be symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another way: if the molecule is symmetrical, it cannot have optical isomerism. Because a symmetrical molecule can't be chiral. So, if dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, then it can't have optical isomers.

Hmm, but wait, wait. Another possibility: if the molecule has a center of chirality, like a tetrahedral carbon with four different substituents. But in dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each attached to two identical groups (since each has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group). So, no chiral centers here.

Therefore, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a moment. What if the double bond itself is a source of chirality? No, double bonds can't be chiral centers because they're sp2 hybridized, which is trigonal planar, so they don't have four substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another point. Let me think about the actual structure of dimethyl fumarate. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule looks like:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
 \ /
  C=C
 / \
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Because that would mean the substituents are same on both ends, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)      CH2(COOCH3)
    \            /
     C=C
    /            \
CH3              CH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the actual structure would have each double bond carbon connected to a CH2(COOCH3) and a CH3 group. Or perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to two CH2(COOCH3) groups, which would make the molecule symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but on opposite sides. So, each substituent is same but arranged trans, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

I think I need to figure out which of these four options exhibit optical isomerism. So far, my analysis is:

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate → I'm unsure. It might have axial chirality.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone → Symmetrical, no optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate → Symmetrical, no optical isomerism.

So, the only possible candidate is option 1. But wait, I'm not sure about option 1.

Wait, another approach: biphenyl compounds can exhibit axial chirality if their substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry. So, in the case of 1,1'-biphenyl derivatives, if the substituents on the two rings are in such positions that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

In option 1, substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 (para to the central bond) and an ester at 2 (ortho to the central bond).

So, each ring has substituents in the para and ortho positions. Now, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring relative to the central bond.

If both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, but their arrangement around the central bond creates a chiral molecule, then it can exhibit optical isomerism.

For example, if the nitro groups are both on the same side relative to the central bond, and the ester groups are on the same side, then the molecule could be chiral.

But wait, each ring has a nitro and an ester group. Now, the question is whether the arrangement of these substituents on each ring leads to a lack of symmetry.

If the two substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

In this case, on each ring, substituents are at 2 (ortho) and 6 (para). So, the nitro is para, and the ester is ortho to the central bond.

So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which could lead to a situation where the molecule is not symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or perhaps it doesn't, making it chiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. However, considering that each ring has two substituents, and they are at 2 and 6, which are not symmetrical relative to the central bond, I think the molecule might be chiral.

Wait, another way: if the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that they are not mirror images, then the molecule would be chiral.

If the substituents are arranged such that they can't be overlapped by their mirror image, then the molecule is chiral.

So, in this case, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate would have substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical along any plane, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, reviewing the options:

The question asks which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

So, after analysis:

Option 1: Yes.

Option 2: No.

Option 3: No.

Option 4: No.

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) might not have optical isomerism because it's symmetrical. But wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a central plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound showing optical isomerism is option 1.

But wait, looking at the answer options, the choices are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, none of the options have only option 1 as correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering option 4.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides.

But wait, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, the substituents on each double bond carbon are same (COOCH3 and CH2), making the molecule symmetrical across the double bond.

So, it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, that leaves only option 1 as a compound showing optical isomerism.

But looking at the given options, option A includes 1, 2, and 4. But we've determined that 2 and 4 don't show optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me go back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. I thought it didn't have a chiral center, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The hydroxyl is on the middle carbon.

If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right),

- One OH,

- One COOCH3.

Wait, that's four substituents. So substituents are:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2(COOCH3),

- H,

- H.

Wait, no, wait. The central carbon is CH2. So it's connected to:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2(COOCH3),

- two H's.

So substituents are: two H's, CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3). Therefore, two substituents are same (H's), so no, it's not a chiral center.

Thus, option 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, only option 1 has optical isomerism. But the given options don't include an option where only 1 is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3). If the substituents on each end of the double bond are same, then it's symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the substituents are different. For example, each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. If the substituents are same on each end, then it's symmetrical. But perhaps in reality, each double bond carbon has two different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
 \ /
  C=C
 / \
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

No, that would make the molecule symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each end of the double bond are different, leading to a lack of symmetry.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: dimethyl fumarate has the same structure as maleic anhydride but as an ester. Wait, no, maleic anhydride is an anhydride, not an ester.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you can draw a plane through the double bond that makes both halves mirror images, then the molecule is achiral.

In this case, the substituents on the left and right of the double bond are the same, so yes, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, back to the original question. The options are:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate → possibly chiral.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → no.

3. benzophenone → no.

4. dimethyl fumarate → no.

So, only option 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the given options, none of the options have only 1 correct. The options are A) 1, 2, 4; B) 3,4; C) 2,3; D) 1,2.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps option 4 does exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think about another possibility.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is an diastereomer, but not enantiomer. Or perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, a meso compound is achiral despite having multiple stereogenic centers because of an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereogenic centers, just a trans double bond. So, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually chiral, and I was wrong earlier.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each end of the double bond are different, so the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if one end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and the other end has a COOCH3 and a different group.

Wait, but both ends of the double bond have the same substituents, so symmetry would still exist.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents aren't identical, leading to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, no, because both ends are diesters of fumaric acid, so the substituents are same on both ends.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

The only option that could have optical isomerism is 1. But in the given options, the only option that includes 1 is option A (1, 2, 4) and option D (1 and 2). But since 2 doesn't have optical isomerism, option D is out.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Let me think about it differently.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CHCH2(COOCH3). So, each CH2 group is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH= group.

Wait, considering the double bond, the substituents on each double bond carbon are a CH2(COOCH3) and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to a CH2(COOCH3) and a CH2 group, but in trans configuration.

But if both ends are same, the molecule would be symmetrical. So, it's not chiral.

Thus, I think option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is option 1. But the given options don't have a choice for only 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps option 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me think again.

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (Carbon 2) has substituents:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2(COOCH3),

- two H's.

So substituents are two H's, CH2(OH), and CH2(COOCH3). So, two substituents are same (H's), so no, it's not a chiral center.

Therefore, option 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl group is on a different position. Let me think if I got the structure wrong.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, which is CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Which again, the central carbon (CH2) has two H's, so no chiral center.

So, I think my conclusion stands: only option 1 has optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again about the structure.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, the biphenyl has two nitro groups at 6 and 6' and two ester groups at 2 and 2'.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 (para to the central bond) and an ester at 2 (ortho to the central bond).

Now, considering the arrangement, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that break the symmetry, the molecule could be chiral.

For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the central bond on both rings, and the esters on the same side, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no symmetry, the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral; otherwise, it's chiral.

In this structure, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring is symmetric with respect to the central bond? Or are they arranged in a way that creates asymmetry?

Wait, each ring has substituents at 2 (ortho) and 6 (para). If the substituents are arranged such that the entire molecule has no symmetry, then it's chiral.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

I think that the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps none of them exhibit optical isomerism except option 1.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think about which of the given options are correct.

Wait, another approach: which compounds can have optical isomerism.

- Benzophenone (3): No.

- Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2): No.

- Dimethyl fumarate (4): No.

- Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1): Yes.

So, only option 1 is correct. But the options don't have an option where only 1 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, which is a meso compound, so it's achiral, hence no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 1. But the answer options don't include an option that only includes 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe option 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, let me think again about option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, does this structure have a chiral center? The central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2(COOCH3),

- two H's.

So substituents: two H's, CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3).

So, four substituents, but two are same (H's). Therefore, no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

So, conclusion: none of the options provided have only 1 correct, but according to the analysis, only option 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But the given options don't include an option with just 1. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in thinking that the ester groups in option 1 are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirrored across the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical and thus achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no symmetry, the molecule is chiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. But considering that the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Thus, perhaps option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism either.

Wait, that would mean none of the options exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not possible because the question states that isomers have two types, constitutional and stereoisomers, implying that at least one of the options must show stereoisomerism.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I'll have to go with my initial analysis and see which option matches.

Based on my analysis:

Only option 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But the given options don't have that. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to revisit the options.

Wait, the first option is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical. So, the substituents are mirrored across the central bond, making the molecule achiral.

If that's the case, then option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

If none of the options exhibit optical isomerism, but the question implies that some do, I must have missed something.

Wait, another angle: perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can form an epoxide, but that's unrelated.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the structure of option 2. Maybe the hydroxyl group is on a different carbon.

Wait, no, I think I have the structure right. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to conclude that the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. I think I need to make a decision based on the analysis.

Based on my analysis, only option 1 has optical isomerism. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm wrong about option 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the substituents are not the same. For example, in fumarate, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually not symmetrical, and thus chiral.

I think I'm running out of time, so I'll make a decision.

Based on my analysis, only option 1 shows optical isomerism. But since the given options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, the only option that includes 1 is option A and D. Since option 2 doesn't show optical isomerism, only option A includes 1 and 4.

But I'm not confident about 4.

Alternatively, perhaps option 4 does show optical isomerism, making option A the correct answer.

Hmm.

Well, I think the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps only option 1 and 2 are correct, but that's option D.

Wait, but option 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

I think I'll have to go with the answer that option 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps only option 1 is correct.

But the given options don't have that. So, I think the correct answer is option A.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires a lack of internal symmetry and the presence of a stereogenic element (e.g., a chiral center or axial chirality).

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'. The biphenyl system can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that prevents the molecule from having a plane of symmetry. Given the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, the molecule is likely chiral and capable of optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is connected to two hydrogens, one hydroxyl group, and one ester group. Since two of the substituents are identical (the hydrogens), this carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule does not exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-CO-Ph, where the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two identical phenyl groups. The molecule is symmetrical and does not have any stereogenic elements, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the ester form of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond, making it achiral. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- **Option 1** exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality in the biphenyl system.  
- **Options 2, 3, and 4** do not exhibit optical isomerism.  

Given the provided answer choices, the only option that includes a correct compound is **A (1, 2, and 4)**, even though the analysis suggests that only compound 1 is correct. This discrepancy may arise from an error in the question's framing or answer options.

Answer: A
