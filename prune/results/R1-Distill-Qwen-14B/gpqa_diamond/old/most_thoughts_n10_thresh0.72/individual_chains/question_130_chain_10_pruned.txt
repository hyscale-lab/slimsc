Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and neutral hydrogen clouds absorbing light from quasars. Hmm, I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift so that these clouds can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

The key here is the Lyman alpha wavelength. I think Lyman alpha emission is at about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, if these clouds are absorbing that light, then the absorption would shift into a different wavelength depending on the redshift.

So when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs the light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But if the cloud is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, the wavelength we observe will be longer than 1216 Angstroms. That's the redshifted wavelength.

But how does this relate to detection by optical telescopes? Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So the redshifted wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption must be in the optical range for us to detect it.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 A, and we need it shifted into the optical range. Wait, what's the typical optical range? I think visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So we need the redshifted wavelength lambda observed to be greater than 4000 Angstroms, because anything above that is visible, and below would be UV which we can't see from the ground.

So the formula for redshift is z = (lambda_observed - lambda_rest) / lambda_rest.

We can set lambda_observed to be just above 4000 Angstroms to find the minimum z. Let's plug in lambda_rest = 1216 A and lambda_observed = 4000 A.

z = (4000 - 1216) / 1216 = (2784) / 1216 â‰ˆ 2.2857.

But wait, that's the redshift when the absorption line is at 4000 A. But if the
