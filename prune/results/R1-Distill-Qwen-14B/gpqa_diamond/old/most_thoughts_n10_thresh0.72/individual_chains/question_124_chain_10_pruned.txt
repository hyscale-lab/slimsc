Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. 

Alright, let's read the question again. So, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, specifically around a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. 

Now, the question is asking, what Lorentz factor would we need so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls? The options are A) 54, B) 68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, okay. I remember that Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. But how does that tie into the particles reaching the detector walls?

Wait, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is important. Because they decay quickly, not all of them will reach the detector's walls. The ones that reach the walls are the ones that have a longer lifetime, right? Or maybe it's about how much the detector can be reached before they decay.

Wait, wait. I think it's more about the time the particles have to travel. Since the detector's radius is 30 meters, the particles must travel 30 meters before decaying. So if a particle doesn't decay quickly enough, it'll make it to the wall. But if it decays before that, it won't.

So the particles' lifetime in the lab frame determines how far they can travel. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. Gamma multiplies this to get the lab frame lifetime.

The distance a particle travels is velocity multiplied by time. But wait, at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance d = v * t. Since v ≈ c, d ≈ c * t. But t is the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * tau.

So, d = c * gamma * tau.

But wait, the particles have to reach the inner walls, so we can say that the maximum distance they can travel is 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the wall, its lifetime must be such that c * gamma tau >= 30 m. Or, in other words, gamma tau = 30 / c.

Hmm, but actually, the fraction of particles that reach the detector is the ratio of those that live long enough to travel 30 meters. So the probability that a particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall would be the fraction that makes it.

Wait, but the problem says on average one third reach the walls when gamma is about 20. Now, the question is for two-thirds. So I think this relates to the probability distribution of the particles' lifetimes. But wait, the particles are produced at
