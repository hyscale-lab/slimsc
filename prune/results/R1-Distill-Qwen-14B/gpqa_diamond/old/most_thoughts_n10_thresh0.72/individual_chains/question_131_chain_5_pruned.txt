Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. Hmm. So, there's a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that was dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—one major and one minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3.

The question is about the 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products. The major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. The options give different pairs of resonances connected by this cross-peak. 

First, I need to figure out what the structures are. Let me break it down.

The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So, something like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond instead. Wait, no—wait, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. So maybe something like HOOC-CH2CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Oh wait, the initial structure is a dicarboxylic acid, so two carboxylic acid groups. The presence of a cis-alkene suggests that in the middle of the chain, perhaps, there's a double bond with the substituents on the same side.

When this is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride by losing water. So the structure would have the two carboxyl groups connected via an oxygen bridge, right? But wait, the dicarboxylic acid would have two COOH groups, so the anhydride would have two COO groups connected by an oxygen.

Wait, but the NMR data is given. The anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where protons are deshielded, like aromatic or perhaps olefinic protons. But since the starting material was a cis-alkene, but dehydration of diacid would form an anhydride
