Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I can check against them once I figure it out.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each has spin up or down. But in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n, right? Spin doesn't directly affect the energy here because the potential doesn't depend on spin. But wait, in a system with identical fermions, like electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. Oh right! They must obey the Pauli exclusion, so each state can have only one fermion with a specific set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which they've given as E multiplied by n². Because E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each n² corresponds to a multiple of E.

So for four particles, each must occupy a different state according to their quantum numbers. But wait, since they are spin-1/2, each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So maybe each spatial level can have two particles.

So, the possible quantum numbers n are 1, 2, 3, etc. Each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, we can fill up the lowest two levels, perhaps.

Wait, let me think step by step.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energies, so we fill the lowest available n with their spin states.

Ground state: Let's see. Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So for four particles, considering spin, each spatial state can have two particles.

So for the ground state, how are the particles arranged?

The spatial part would have the lowest possible n, but since each n can have two spins, let's see.

For four identical spin-1/2 particles, we can have:

n=1, spin up and down: that's two particles.

n=2, spin up and down: another two particles. So that's four particles in total.

Wait, but is that the ground state? Because the energy is determined by the sum of each particle's energy.

So each particle's energy is E_n = n² E.

So for n=1, energy is E. For n=2, it's 4E.

So two particles in n=1

Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I remember from my studies that particles in such a well have quantized energy levels. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Okay, let's think. Each particle is a spin-1/2, so they can have spins up or down. But wait, in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the particles are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle because they are fermions. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle has to occupy a unique quantum state, considering their spin.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by the formula E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh wait, the problem defines E as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_1 = 1²E = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3=9E, E_4=16E, and so on.

Now, since we have four particles, all spin-1/2, each can occupy the same spatial state but with opposite spins, up to two per spatial state. Because for each spatial level n, there's a spin-up and spin-down possibility, allowing two particles per n.

Wait, no, wait. Spin is a separate degree of freedom. So each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, we can have two particles in that state.

But wait, each particle is a fermion, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So for identical particles, when you swap two, the wavefunction changes sign. But since the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions, the total wavefunction (spatial part × spin part) must be antisymmetric.

Hmm, but when considering the ground state and excited states, the spatial wavefunction will be symmetric or antisymmetric? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should model the filling of the states.

Since each particle is spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states for each spatial orbital. So in the ground state, what's the lowest possible energy arrangement?

The ground state would have the lowest
