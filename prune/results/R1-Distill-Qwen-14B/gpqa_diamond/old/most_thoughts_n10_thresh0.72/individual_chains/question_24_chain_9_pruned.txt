Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what I can figure out.

Okay, the problem is about some mixtures undergoing different reactions, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Let's break down the information given.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has unsaturation, like double bonds or triple bonds. But wait, the question says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X. So maybe they're not conjugated, but they're still unsaturatedâ€”like maybe each has a single double bond or something. So X's components are likely alkenes or maybe even alkynes, but more likely alkenes since they decolorize bromine.

When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms mixture Y, which is equimolar and results from a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Oh wait, but the initial treatment is with platinum. Wait, I thought that alkenes can undergo hydrogenation with platinum. But wait, in this case, it's a disproportionation, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, let's think again. When alkenes react with H2 in the presence of a catalyst like Pt, they hydrogenate to alkanes. But that's a hydrogenation reaction. But here, the reaction is causing a disproportionation, so it's not a simple hydrogenation. So maybe the starting materials are something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the reaction with Pt when heated might involve the breakdown of a larger molecule. Or perhaps the starting material is something like a diene or a compound with multiple double bonds. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever Y is, it doesn't have double bonds or triple bonds, or at least not in conjugation. Because if Y's components don't have any, then they wouldn't decolorize bromine. So Y must be alkanes.

So, assuming X is a mixture of two alkenes, which upon some reaction with Pt gives Y as a mixture of alkanes. But wait, the problem says
