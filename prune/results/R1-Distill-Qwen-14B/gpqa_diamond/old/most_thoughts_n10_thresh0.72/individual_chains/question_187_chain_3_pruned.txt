Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and how many stars it can detect. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for things like studying exoplanets and measuring stellar velocities. It's mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which has 8-meter telescopes. So, the question is about whether each star listed meets the S/N ratio requirement of at least 10 per binned pixel in one hour.

Wait, right, the signal-to-noise ratio depends on several factors: the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency. I think the key here is to figure out the V magnitude of each star because that determines how much light it emits, which affects the S/N.

The formula I remember for S/N is something like S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / noise. But maybe a simpler approach is to look up the ESPRESSO's performance in terms of V magnitude limits.

Let me try to recall. ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high precision, but I'm not sure about its exact V magnitude capability. I think for ESPRESSO, the typical limiting magnitude for a S/N of 10 per pixel might be around V=20 or so. Wait, no, maybe brighter. Because for high-resolution spectroscopy, you need more photons, so fainter stars might not be detected.

Wait, but I found online before that ESPRESSO has a certain range. Oh wait, for ESPRESSO, the typical S/N per pixel for a star depends on how bright it is. Let me think about how to calculate it.

The formula for S/N ratio in spectroscopy is generally given by:

S/N = (10^(-0.4*(m - m0))) * sqrt(t) / (R * ... )

Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Maybe another approach. Let's think about the V magnitude of each star and the distance. The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d / 10 pc), where M is the absolute magnitude, and d is the distance in parsecs.

So for each star, I'll calculate their apparent V magnitude and see if it
