Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this nuclear decay problem. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The energy spectrum of E particles is continuous with an endpoint Q. Now, in the variant, instead of 2V, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. I need to compare the E spectra in both cases.

Wait, I remember that in decay processes, the energy distribution of emitted particles depends on the conservation laws, like energy and momentum. Also, the type of particles emitted affects the possible energies.

In the original setup, 2E and 2V are emitted. If the particles E and V are of similar types, like electrons and neutrinos (though neutrinos are not massless), perhaps the energy spectrum is continuous because of the conservation of momentum and energy. But in the variant, two V particles are replaced by a single M which is massless. So now, it's 2E and M.

I think that when multiple particles are emitted, the energy spectrum can be continuous if the particles can share energy in a way that allows for a range of possible energies. For example, in beta decay, an electron and antineutrino are emitted, and the electron's energy is continuous because the neutrino carries away some energy, and since it's massless (or nearly so), its energy can vary, leading to a continuous spectrum.

Wait, but in the original case, why is the E spectrum continuous? Maybe because the E's can have a range of energies depending on how the energy is divided between the E's and the V's. So when you have 2V's, which could be, say, two photons or something else, the E particles can have varying energies as the energy is shared.

Now, the variant is replacing 2V with one M. If M is massless, then it's like another particle that can carry away some energy. But since it's only one, maybe the system is different.

In the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. So for each E, the energy depends on how the energy is divided between the two E's and the two V's. The conservation of energy and momentum must be considered. But in the case where you have two V's, perhaps each can carry away some energy, allowing the E's to have a continuous spectrum.

In the variant, with one M (massless), perhaps the energy distribution changes. Let me think about it in terms of kinematics.

In the original case, each E particle's energy could vary because the V's can share the remaining energy. So the E's don't have a fixed energy, hence the continuous spectrum.

In the variant, with only one M and two E's, maybe the E's are forced to have more specific energy distributions. Wait, no, because the decay is still a two-body decay? Or is it a multi-body?

Wait, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So it's a four-body decay. That's a bit complicated, but the E's and V's are emitted in pairs.

In the variant, 2A → 2B + 2E +
