Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. 

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the problem itself has two parts, A and B. Let me break it down.

Part A is asking which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the shifting of a hydrogen and the rearrangement of double bonds, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, I need to think about whether these compounds can undergo such a shift.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone actually has two ketone-like groups but in a ring. Oh, wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So, it's like a cyclic diketone—like 1,4-benzoquinone. For tautomerism, the molecule needs to have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. So, if the benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, then it can undergo tautomerism. Let me see: in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to an aromatic ring, so the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. Wait, wait. The carbonyl groups are in positions where the adjacent carbons are each attached to two other carbons from the ring. So, they don't have hydrogens attached. Because the structure is like O=C6H4=O, but wait, no—actually benzoquinone's structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, but the benzene ring is fully conjugated. So each carbonyl group is on a carbon that's adjacent to other carbons in the ring. Wait, no, the carbonyls are in positions that are adjacent to other ring carbons, but those carbons (the ones attached to O) are each connected to two other ring carbons, making them probably not have any alpha hydrogens. Because the structure is O=C-C6H3-C=O? No, wait, I think benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but wait, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the ring. So, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's connected to two other carbons (the ring), so those adjacent carbons don't have any hydrogens. So no alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, there's no possibility for enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism.

What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, cyclohexane with three ketones. Each ketone is at alternating positions. So each carbonyl is attached to two other ring carbons. Again, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the ring. So, for each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons are CH groups. Wait, because the ring is cyclohexane, so each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons, one being the carbonyl. Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is at positions 1,3,5, so each is separated by two carbons. So the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2- in a ring? Hmm, not exactly. Wait, no, the ring is cyclohexane, so each CH2 group is connected. Wait, maybe it's a six-membered ring with three keto groups. So the structure is something like O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C in a ring. But wait, that's not possible because that would require more than six atoms. Hmmm, perhaps each of the carbonyl groups is on every other carbon. So, the structure might be O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C, but in a ring. Wait, but that would be seven atoms if it's a six-membered ring. Maybe wait, perhaps each of the carbonyl groups is at positions 1,3,5, so each is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons which are not carbonyl groups. So those adjacent carbons (CH2 groups) would have hydrogens. So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to carbonyl) have hydrogens. So, this compound would have alpha hydrogens, meaning it can undergo enol tautomerism. But wait, can it? Because for enol tautomer
