Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product is after a series of reactions. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, the molecular formula can give some clues about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, substituting the values: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3), maybe a double bond or ring, and another ring or double bond. Alternatively, a ring plus a double bond and a carbonyl group. The NMR data might help here.

Looking at the 1H-NMR data: 

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) â†’ This is a strong downfield shift. Probably an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet suggests maybe coupling with two adjacent protons, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually singlets because there's only one proton. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Wait, another possibility: an acidic proton like an -OH in a carbonyl compound? Or perhaps a vinylogous aldehyde, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton. Wait, no, enol protons are usually around 6-8 ppm. Or maybe an aldehyde group with adjacent substituents that cause the triplet. Wait, aldehyde protons are typically deshielded but appear as singlets because there's no adjacent protons. Hmm. Maybe this is something else.

Next peak: 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet, probably aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring, with two protons coupling with each other. Like a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, which would give a doublet for each set of protons. 

6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, perhaps another set of aromatic protons. Maybe two protons ortho to substitu
