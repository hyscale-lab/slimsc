Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, I think. But wait, the question is about their equilibrium temperatures. Right, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering how much energy it receives from its star and how much it radiates back.

The system has five exoplanets in orbital resonance, with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has a period ratio of 1, Planet_2 is 2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, and Planet_5 is 5. Wait, or is the ratio given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for their periods? I think so.

The question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so albedo (which affects how much light they reflect) isn't a factor here. So the main thing affecting their temperatures would be their distance from the star and their orbital periods.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula I remember is T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * Ï€ * sigma * D^2 )) )^0.25, but maybe I can simplify it. Oh, right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T
