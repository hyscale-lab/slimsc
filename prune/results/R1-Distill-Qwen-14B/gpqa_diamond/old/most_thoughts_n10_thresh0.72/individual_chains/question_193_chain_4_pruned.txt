Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think aloud.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, like, N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1 / distance in parsecs, right? So distance (r) is 1 / plx. Wait, or is it the other way around? Parallax is how much the star's position shifts as seen from Earth's orbit, so when the star is closer (smaller r), the parallax is larger. So yeah, plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/r, or maybe r = 1/plx, but wait, actually, the formula is r = 1/(plx), but I'm not sure about the exact scaling. Let me think: parallax (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So if distance increases, parallax decreases.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ plx^(-5). But I need to find how N changes with distance r.

Since r is 1/plx, plx = 1/r. So substituting, N becomes proportional to (1/r)^(-5) because plx is 1/r. Wait, plx is 1/r, so 1/plx would be r. Wait, maybe I should write it more carefully.

Let me think: plx = 1/(r) where r is in parsecs. So plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So substituting into N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, we can write N ∝ (1/(1/r))^5. Because plx is 1/r, 1/plx is r. So (1/(plx))^5 is (r)^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, but let me check that substitution again.

Wait, if plx = 1/(r), then 1/plx = r. So 1/plx^5 would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So, the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, that doesn't make much sense intuitively. Wait, because as distance increases, the number of stars should decrease, right? Because stars are more concentrated in the galactic plane and closer regions, but maybe in this question's specific scenario, it's a different situation. Hmm, but according to the math, N is proportional to r^5, so if r increases, N would increase, which seems counterintuitive. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let me double-check the substitution. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then plx^5 = (1/r)^5. So 1/(plx^5) = r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases, which would mean more stars at larger distances, which seems odd. But perhaps in this question's context, that's the case. But I need to focus on
