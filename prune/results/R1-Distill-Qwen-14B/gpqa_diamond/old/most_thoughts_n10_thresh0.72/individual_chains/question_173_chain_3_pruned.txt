Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? So, the problem states that an electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. 

Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), with the equation Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I think I might have that slightly wrong. Oh right, the exact expression is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, but sometimes people just use Δx Δp ≈ ħ for an approximate calculation, especially when the 1/2 factor isn't critical for order of magnitude estimates.

So, the first thing I should do is find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, using the uncertainty in position. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy, ΔE, but wait, how exactly?

I think the relation between energy and momentum for a particle comes from the kinetic energy equation. Since the electron is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light? Wait, let me check. The speed given is 2e8 m/s. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 2e8 is about two-thirds the speed of light. So relativistic effects might be important here. Oh wait, but electrons have such small rest mass energies that even at a significant fraction of c, their kinetic energy isn't way higher than their rest mass energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

But wait, let me think about the uncertainty in energy. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp because ΔE is the uncertainty in the kinetic energy. So for a non-relativistic case, E = p²/(2m). Therefore, the uncertainty in E would be ΔE ≈ (2Δp)/(2m) * p, wait no. Let me compute it more carefully.

In terms of differentials, E = (p²)/(2m). So, dE = (2p/(2m)) dp = (p dp)/m. So ΔE ≈ p * Δp / m. But I'm not sure if that's the correct way to approach it. Alternatively, using error propagation, the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately (ΔE/E) ≈ 2*(Δp/p), since E is proportional to p squared. So, ΔE ≈ 2E*(Δp/p).

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to express ΔE in terms of Δp and the momentum itself. Let me think. The kinetic energy E is p
