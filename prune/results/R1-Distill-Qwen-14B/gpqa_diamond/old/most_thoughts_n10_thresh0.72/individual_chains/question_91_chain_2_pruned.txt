Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

The first part of the reaction is treating cyclohexanone with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. Then, the mixture is acidified to form product 1. Hmm, I remember that LDA is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate compounds. Cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens, right? So when LDA is added, it would deprotonate cyclohexanone to form an enolate.

Wait, cyclohexanone's alpha protons are on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. Deprotonating would give an enolate ion. Then adding benzaldehyde. Oh, right, that's a typical example of a crossed aldol reaction. The enolate would attack the benzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde. So the benzaldehyde would act as the electrophile.

So the enolate would have a negative charge on the oxygen and a positive alpha carbon. The attack would happen on the benzaldehyde's carbonyl, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond. After that, protonation occurs. But wait, after the aldol addition, there's acid work-up. Oh, right, acidifying the mixture would protonate any enolates, so maybe the aldol adduct forms a beta-hydroxy ketone.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The aldol addition would form a new six-membered ring with the benzaldehyde group attached. Let me try to visualize. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. The enolate would attack the benzaldehyde's carbonyl, forming a new carbon chain. So the product would be something like a cyclohexyl group attached to a benzyl group via a single bond, with a hydroxyl group in the aldol position.

Wait, no, the aldol addition typically forms a new alcohol. So product 1 would be a cyclohexyl benzyl ether with a hydroxyl group? Or more accurately, the aldol product is a beta-hydroxy ketone. So maybe the structure would be cyclohexanone with an additional substituent from benzaldehyde. Let me think: when enolates attack, the aldol product has a new carbon chain. So the cyc
