Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The given data are phase shifts, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, with different values in fm.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, especially in nuclear physics, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) has a relation involving the phase shifts δ_l. The formula is something like f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l ( (2l+1) exp(iδ_l) sin(δ_l) * e^{ilφ} Pl(cosθ) ) ), where Pl is the Legendre polynomial.

But wait, in this problem, I'm only asked about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, along the incident beam direction means θ=0, right? Because the incident beam is coming along, say, the z-axis, so θ=0 would be the direction of the beam. At θ=0, what's the value of Pl(cosθ)?

Let me think. Pl(1) since cos(0)=1. Legendre polynomials at 1 are all 1, because Pl(1)=1 for any l. So for each term, Pl(1)=1. So the scattering amplitude becomes f(0,φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum ( (2l+1) exp(iδ_l) sin(δ_l) e^{ilφ} ) ).

But wait, the imaginary part is what's needed. The imaginary part of f(θ, φ) along θ=0 direction. So f can be written as f = A + iB, where B is the imaginary part.

But each term in the sum is a complex number. Let me think about each term.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) exp(iδ_l) sin(δ_l) e^{ilφ}.

Wait, exp(iδ_l) can be written as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when multiplied by sin δ_l, each term becomes [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) ] e^{ilφ}.

Wait, no, wait. The term is exp(iδ_l)
