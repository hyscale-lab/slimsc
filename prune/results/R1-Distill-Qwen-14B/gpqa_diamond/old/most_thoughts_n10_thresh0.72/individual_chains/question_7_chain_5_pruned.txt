Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking for the energy at which gamma-ray lifetimes are limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon, like a CMB photon, they can produce an electron-positron pair if the energy conditions are right. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation. So, the gamma-ray photon has enough energy to annihilate with a CMB photon into particles.

I think this has to do with the photon-photon cross-section and the mean free path. If the mean free path is small, the gamma-ray will annihilate quickly, which means its lifetime is limited by this process. So the problem is about finding the energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe, or something like that.

The mean free path (lambda) is the inverse of the interaction rate (n * sigma * v), where n is the number density of the target photons, sigma is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity. Wait, but since photons are moving at the speed of light, maybe v is approximated as c, so v ≈ 1 in natural units.

The interaction rate would then be the product of the cross-section, the number density of CMB photons, and the photon's velocity. The number density of CMB photons can be calculated using the CMB temperature. Oh, right, the CMB photon number density is given by n = (g * T^3) / (2 pi^2), where g is a factor like 2 for the two polarizations. Wait, no, more precisely, the formula for the number density of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium is n = (g * (k_B T)^3) / ( (2 pi^2) (ħ c)^3 ) ), but maybe I can approximate it.

Wait, I think the standard number density of CMB photons is about n ≈ 411 photons/cm³. Or wait, since the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K, so T ≈ 0.23 meV (since 1 eV ≈ 11605 K, so 2.7 K is about 2.7/11605 ≈ 0.00023 eV, which is 0.23 meV). But the average energy per photon is like 2.7 K, so around 10^-3 eV as given, which matches.

The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is a function of the center-of-mass energy. The threshold for producing an electron-positron pair is when the combined energy is at least 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So for a gamma-ray photon with energy E and a CMB photon with energy E_cm ≈ 1e-3 eV (but wait, maybe it's the average energy, but the peak is actually lower. Hmm, maybe I should use the average photon energy as given in the problem, which is 1e-3 eV.)

Wait, no, the CMB photons have a blackbody spectrum, so the average energy is about 2.7 k_B T, but in any case, the problem says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so I can take that as given.

So the process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. The cross-section for this is roughly given by σ ≈ ( (4 π α² ) / (3 s) ) * ( (s) )^2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should recall that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into a pair peaks when the center-of-mass energy is around 1 MeV. The cross-section actually depends on the square of the logarithm of the ratio of the photon energies or something like that. Alternatively, I think the cross-section formula is something like σ(E
