Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question says that the compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each of these.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, maybe even a strong peak. But wait, two other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, or perhaps an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Or maybe the 1650 is due to conjugated carbonyl groups or an amide, but I don't see any info about amines here.

Wait, the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl Hs are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond. Also, the presence of multiple peaks in the NMR suggests various types of protons, but that's not too helpful without specifics.

Moving on to the Mass Spec: a fragment peak at m/z 45. I should think about what possible fragments give m/z 45. 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, like maybe (CH3)2O (which is 45, but wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let's calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. So 12*2 + 1*6 +16= 24 +6 +16=46. No, that's 46. Hmm, not matching. What else? Maybe a ketone or another group. Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecular ion minus
