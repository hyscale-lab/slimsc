Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because blackbody radiation and star luminosity can be a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step. 

The question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times bigger. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Hmm, interesting. So both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, that's the Doppler effect. But wait, in this problem, the peak wavelengths they measured are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift from their velocities is accounted for in the observed peak wavelengths. Or maybe the radial velocities are given just for another part of the problem. Hmm, the problem says they computed the luminosities using blackbody radiation, so perhaps the radial velocities are a red herring here, or perhaps they affect the observed wavelength, but since the peak wavelengths are same, maybe the actual temperatures are same. 

Wait, but I'm supposed to compute the luminosity based on blackbody radiation. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since they're assuming blackbody radiation, that's the formula to use.

So, the problem says the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to find L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2. And from earlier, since the peak wavelengths are same (so T1 = T2), their temperatures are equal. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, could the radial velocity affect the observed temperature? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the Doppler effect would shift the wavelengths. But the peak wavelengths measured are the same. So the observed wavelengths are same
