Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

So, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, I think this has to do with the lifetime of the particles and how far they can travel before decaying. Because if a particle decays, it won't reach the detector walls. So, the fraction that reaches the walls depends on their speed and lifetime.

Wait, right. The proper lifetime (proper time) of the particle is its lifetime in its rest frame. But from our lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The Lorentz factor gamma is time dilation factor. So, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime: t = gamma * t0.

The particles are produced at the center of the detector, which has a radius of 30 meters. So, the maximum distance a particle can travel before hitting the wall is 30 meters. But wait, no, because the particle is moving at ultra-relativistic speeds. The distance they can cover before decaying depends on their speed and lifetime.

Wait, the distance a particle travels before decaying is v * t, where v is their velocity and t is the lifetime in the lab frame. But if the particle's lifetime is too short, it won't reach the detector walls.

So, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is based on whether its lifetime is long enough to make the trip. Alternatively, the number that reach the wall depends on the fraction whose lifetime allows them to traverse the detector before decaying.

But I think it's more about the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. If the decay length is longer than the
