Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product 3. Let me try to work through each step carefully.

The question says that toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to get product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. I need to determine the molecular symmetry group (also known as the point group) of product 3.

Hmm, I think I should start by figuring out what each step does. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the reaction of toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitric acid is a nitrating agent, and sulfuric acid is a catalyst. Toluene undergoes nitration. The nitration typically occurs at the para position because the methyl group is activating and ortho/para-directing. So product 1 should be para-nitrotoluene. Wait, but nitration of toluene usually occurs in the para position, so that's correct. So structure-wise, product 1 is methylbenzene with a nitro group on the para position. The structure would be a benzene ring with a CH3 group and a NO2 group opposite each other.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, I think this is a nitration followed by oxidation. Wait, no, MnO2 is often used for oxidizing nitro groups. Oh right, nitro groups can be oxidized. Wait, but what happens when a nitro group is oxidized? The nitro group (NO2) can be oxidized further. The oxidation of nitrobenzene under strong acidic conditions with MnO2 gives what? I think nitrobenzene can be oxidized to nitrobenzene's diacid? No, wait. Wait, nitrobenzene (which is product 1) when oxidized with strong acidic conditions and MnO2 would form a nitroso group? Or perhaps, wait, no. Wait, nitrobenzene upon oxidation, especially under acidic conditions, can form a nitro group being converted into a nit
