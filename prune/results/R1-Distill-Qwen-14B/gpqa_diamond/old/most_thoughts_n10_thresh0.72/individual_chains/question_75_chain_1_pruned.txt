Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The setup is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They want to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G with an added hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, it didn't work as expectedâ€”no overexpression.

The problem is in the DNA sequence they got. I need to figure out why they can't overexpress the protein. The options are A to D. 

Looking at the given DNA sequence, it's the plus strand of the construct. So the coding sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me see if there are any obvious issues.

Wait, the construct includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. HA is usually a small peptide, maybe around 11 amino acids. Let me think about how that's added. The coding sequence for HA should be inserted right after the start codon.

Looking at the sequence, right after ATG, the next codon is TAC. TAC is Tyrosine. But wait, the HA tag's coding sequence should probably come right after ATG. So maybe the sequence is wrong there. Let me think: the HA tag is from Influenza A virus. Its amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA sequence would be something like TAC TTC TAC GAT TTA TTA, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the added HA sequence isn't present, or perhaps there's a mutation.

Wait, the person introduced the HA sequence into the construct. So the coding sequence starts with the HA tag followed by GADD45G. But looking at the given DNA, after ATG, the next codon is TAC. Let me write the first few codons:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC CGG ACC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So, the first few codons are:

ATG (start)
TAC (Y)
CCA (P)
TAC (Y)
GAT (D)
GTT (V)
CCA (P)
GAT (D)
TAC (Y)
GCC (A)
AAA (K)
TGA (Stop? Wait, TGA is a stop codon.)

Wait a minute, wait. After the ATG start codon, the next codon is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (stop). Oh no, that's a problem. 

Because the TGA is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation right after the HA tag starts. So the HA might not be correctly expressed because the stop codon is introduced early. So the HA is supposed to be added, but perhaps the construct has a stop codon in the wrong place. 

Wait, why would TGA be a stop? Let me think. The sequence goes ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC... So after the HA tag is added, which is at the N-terminus, the coding sequence should be for the HA followed by GADD45G. But in this case, the first codon after the ATG is TAC (Y), which would be the first amino acid of the HA. But then after a few codons, we get to TGA, which is a stop, so the protein would be truncated right there. That can't be right. 

So the construct would produce a very short peptide, ending at the HA sequence, but probably not the full-length HA-GADD45G fusion. That would prevent the overexpression, because the protein is being cut off early.

Looking at the options, option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would fit if the stop codon is present in the coding sequence. So if the construct has an early stop codon, the protein would be truncated, and thus not overexpressed.

Wait, but why is there a TGA in the coding sequence? Let me look again. The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. The construct includes the HA sequence before the GADD45G. But in the provided DNA, the first part after ATG is TAC, which is Y, which is correct if HA starts with Y. But then the sequence continues, and then at position 10 or so, there's a TGA.

Wait, let me count the codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
