Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had gotten smaller, and two new spots appeared. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which products form.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's an addition reaction, typically an acid-catalyzed process leading to an electrophilic addition. The mechanism is probably via the carbocation intermediate. Wait, but wait, the molecule in question here is an ether, right? Because it's an oxybenzene with a substituent.

So the structure is a benzene ring with an ether group (-O-) attached, and the substituent on the oxygen is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw that. The substituent is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. But-3-en-1-yl means a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no, but the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl, so on the second carbon, two methyl groups.

Wait, but wait, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but-3-enyl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that doesn't make sense because but-3-enyl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible for a four-carbon chain. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: but-3-en-1-yl.

Butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So but-3-en
