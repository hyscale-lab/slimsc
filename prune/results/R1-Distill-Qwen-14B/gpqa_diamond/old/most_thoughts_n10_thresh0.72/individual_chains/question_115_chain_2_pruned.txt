Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. The setup is that the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they produce two photons with the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. The question is about finding the angle between the two photons' directions.

Wait, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. But since the electron and positron are moving, their rest frames are different. Oh right, in their center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photons would go in opposite directions. But here, the problem is in the lab frame.

Wait, but the question says they produce two photons with the same energy. So maybe they have equal and opposite momenta? But wait, photons have momentum p = E/c, and their direction is also important. So if the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but their directions might be symmetric about some axis.

But wait, the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric around the horizontal axis. So the angle between them would be something like 2θ, where θ is the angle each makes with the horizontal.

But wait, why would the photons go in those directions
