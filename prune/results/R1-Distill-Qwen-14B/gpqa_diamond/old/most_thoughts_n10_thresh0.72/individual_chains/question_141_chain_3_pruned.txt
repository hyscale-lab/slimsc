Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. And I need to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A to D, with numbers 1 to 4.

Wait, wait... 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo or a misinterpretation. Wait, 1-bromo-2-d... No, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Wait, the way it's written, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, maybe 1-bromobenzene-2-d is actually 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes, when they write the substituents, they list them in order. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So, the structure would be a benzene ring where the bromine is at ortho position to one methyl group and para to another. Wait, no, 1 is the bromine, 2 and 4 would be ortho and para positions relative to each other, but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is
