Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Like enantiomers. So the question is asking which of the four given compounds show this property.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the positions 6 and 2â€”so is there a possibility of a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are symmetrically arranged, maybe not. But wait, the substituents here are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. So, if the biphenyl has substituents on both rings, is there a plane of symmetry? If both rings have the same substituents in similar positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. However, the positions are 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, 2 and 6 are across from each other on a benzene ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So when the two rings are connected, maybe the arrangement allows for a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it can have stereoisomerism.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. If the biphenyl has a single bond, the two rings can rotate, but in this case, maybe the substituents are such that when the rings rotate, the substituents end up in positions that would make the molecule chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, but wait, it's a biphenyl, so maybe it's about the possibility of the molecule being non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Wait, I'm not sure. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So when looking
