Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a point. So the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. Oh wait, that's the divergence theorem, right? So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS, where n is the outward normal vector.

But wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral of the divergence. So I need to calculate ∇·f first, then integrate it over the volume of the sphere.

Let me think about the vector field. It's given that it's only radial and depends on r as 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, f(r) = (F_r, 0, 0), where F_r = 1/r².

The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field (F_r, F_θ, F_φ) is given by (1/(r²)) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(F_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ/∂φ. But since F_θ and F_φ are zero here, the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

So substituting F_r = 1/r², let's compute that.

First, compute r² F_r: that's r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence ∇·f is (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, so ∇·f is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin? Because the field goes like 1/r², which reminds me of
