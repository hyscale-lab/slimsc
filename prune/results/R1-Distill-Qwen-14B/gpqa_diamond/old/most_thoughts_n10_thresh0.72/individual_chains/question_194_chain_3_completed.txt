Okay, I need to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on partition functions, but let me think this through.

So, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

Wait, but maybe I can approach this by considering the possible values of the energy first. Because each state has a certain energy, and the partition function is the sum of exponentials of each state's energy.

The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me try to compute the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So the sum of three such terms can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2. Let me see:

If all three terms are +1, the sum is 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, the sum is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, the sum is -1. If all are -1, sum is -3.

Wait, but how do the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 behave? Let me think. For each pair, S_i S_j is 1 if the spins are aligned, -1 if anti-aligned.

So, for each possible state (each combination of S1, S2, S3), I can compute the sum.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about how many states have a particular value of the sum. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the number of states for each possible energy.

Wait, the energy E is proportional to the sum. Let me compute the value of the sum for each state, then compute E, and then the exponential term.

But considering all 8 states might be manageable. Let's list all possible states and compute the sum.

Each spin can be +1 or -1. So the possible states are:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
S1S2= -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3= -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
S1S2= -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3= +1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= +1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
S1S2= -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
S1S2= +1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1. Sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
S1S2= +1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= +1. Sum is 3. E = -3J.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck that.

Wait, for state 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

S2S3 = (+1)(+1)= +1.

Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E is -J*(-1) = J.

Same for others.

So, looking at all 8 states, how many have sum=3? Only two states: all +1 and all -1.

Wait, all +1: sum 3, E=-3J.

All -1: S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E=-3J.

So two states have E=-3J.

The other six states have sum=-1. So E= J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E). So each state contributes exp(β E), right? Wait, no: the exponent is -β E. So for E=-3J, it's -β*(-3J) = 3β J.

Wait, Z = sum_{s} exp(-β E_s).

So for each state, compute exp(-beta E), sum all.

So for the two states with E=-3J: each contributes exp(3 β J).

So 2 * exp(3 β J).

For the remaining 6 states with E= J: each contributes exp(-β J).

So 6 * exp(- β J).

So Z = 2 e^(3 J β) +6 e^(- J β).

Wait, let me check the options.

Option B is Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ). So that's what I'm getting.

Looking at the options given:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{+Jβ} → No, because the exponents are opposite.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, matches.

Option C: 2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Option D: 6e^{2Jβ} +2e^{-2Jβ} → No.

So correct answer should be option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the given system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by analyzing the energy of the system. The energy is given as:

\[
E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3),
\]

where \( J \) is a coupling constant, and \( \beta = \frac{1}{kT} \) is the inverse temperature. The partition function \( Z \) is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

### Step 1: Possible Energy Values
Each spin pair \( S_iS_j \) can take values \( +1 \) (aligned) or \( -1 \) (anti-aligned). The sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can therefore range from \( -3 \) to \( +3 \) in steps of \( 2 \). The corresponding energy values are:

- If \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \): \( E = -3J \),
- If \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \): \( E = J \),
- If \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -3 \): \( E = 3J \).

### Step 2: Counting States for Each Energy
For three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. By examining all combinations of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), we find:

- **Two states** have \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \): all spins \( +1 \) or all spins \( -1 \). These contribute \( E = -3J \).
- **Six states** have \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \). These contribute \( E = J \).

### Step 3: Partition Function
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum over all states of \( e^{-\beta E} \). Substituting the energy values:

- For the two states with \( E = -3J \): \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3J\beta} \). Total contribution: \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).
- For the six states with \( E = J \): \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-J\beta} \). Total contribution: \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
Comparing with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, signs of exponents are reversed).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents and coefficients).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}}
\]

Answer: B
