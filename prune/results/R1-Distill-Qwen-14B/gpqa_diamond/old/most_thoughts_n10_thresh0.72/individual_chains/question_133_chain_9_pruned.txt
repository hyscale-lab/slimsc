Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1.00 grams each in 200 cm³ of solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything here. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions... I think those are the HPO4^2- ions, right? Because H3PO4 can dissociate into H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, and then PO4^3-. So orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- form. Got it.

So, I remember that when you have a solution with both a weak acid and its conjugate base, it forms a buffer solution. Oh wait, right! The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here. Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (the acid) and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). So they're in a buffer system.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, which pKa should I use? The H3PO4 has three dissociation steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-, with Ka1 = 7.5e-3. Then the second is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-, Ka2 = 6.2e-8. And the third is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-, with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. 

Since the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, that's the second dissociation, so I should use pKa2 for the equation. So pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Let me calculate that. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 would be log(1/(6.2e-8)). Hmm, wait, log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8). Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.79 -8 = -7.21. So pKa2 is 7.21? Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka), so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.21, yes.

So the Henderson equation becomes pH = 7.21 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, I don't have the pH given. Oh, wait, but I think I can find the pH from the solution. Alternatively, maybe I can find the concentration ratio of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- using
