Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them, labeled A1 to A5, I guess. Let me go through the details step by step.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance. It decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state or maybe the formula) of A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, oxidation state? Wait, 31.96% fluorine by mass in A2. Because oF here probably stands for the percentage by mass of fluorine in A2.

So, A1 decomposes into A2 and F2 (fluorine gas). Let me write that as a decomposition reaction. A1 → A2 + F2.

Since it's a decomposition, A1 is probably a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one and F2. So, perhaps A1 is a more complex fluoride, releasing F2.

Next, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized usually means it's acting as a reducing agent. Wait, no, in terms of redox reactions, oxidation implies losing electrons. But if A1 is oxidizing xenon, then A1 is the oxidizing agent, meaning it causes xenon to lose electrons. So xenon is getting oxidized, which implies that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So A3 is likely YF, the simplest fluoride. Wait, but fluorinating Y would probably form the most stable or common fluoride. But since there are five compounds, maybe YF has multiple oxidation states.

Wait, the problem states that when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. So the reaction is Y (in 1:1 ratio) + A4 (hot, colorless, concentrated) → A5. Then A
