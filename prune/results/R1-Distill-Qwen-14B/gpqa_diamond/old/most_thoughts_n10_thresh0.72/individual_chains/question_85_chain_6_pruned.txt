Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember equilibrium temperature has something to do with the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from it. Oh right, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and A is the albedo. Oh wait, but the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so A cancels out when taking the ratio. That's helpful.

Wait, but how do I find the distances a for each planet? The question mentions they detected the planets using transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. Oh right, the transit method gives the planet's radius because it blocks some light, while the RV method gives the mass. But how does that relate to the distance?

Oh wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance through the velocity amplitude. The RV formula is K = (v*sin i) = [ (G * M_star * sin i) / (4 * pi^2 * (M_star + M_planet)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) )? Wait, maybe I should think about the RV semi-amplitude formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2 pi G)
