Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ=10^-17 degrees. The galaxy is at a distance d=10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, with exponents ranging from 59 to 66.

Wait, entropy of a black hole... Oh right, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, maybe it's S = (k A) / (4 ħ G), but I think I'm mixing units here. Alternatively, there's a formula that uses the Schwarzschild radius. Oh yeah, the area A is 4π R_s², since the event horizon is a sphere.

So, the steps I need to do: first, find the Schwarzschild radius R_s of the black hole using the given angular size and distance. Then calculate the area A, plug that into the entropy formula to find S.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Convert the angular size θ from degrees to radians because when calculating using small angles, θ ≈ Δr / d, where Δr is the actual size (d is distance). But wait, in radians, θ ≈
