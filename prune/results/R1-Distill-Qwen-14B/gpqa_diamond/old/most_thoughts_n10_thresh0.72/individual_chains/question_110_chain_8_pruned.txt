Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy question, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. 

First, I remember that each spectrograph has a different brightness limit. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So, a star needs to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, actually, wait—wait, no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that means any star with V mag ≤ 17 can be detected by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag; so stars with V mag ≤16 can be detected by HIRES.

So, to be detected by both, the star's V magnitude must be ≤16 because HIRES's limit is 16, and ESPRESSO can go to 17. So if a star is brighter than 16 (i.e., V mag ≤16), both can detect it.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The problem says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. So, the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter. So the maximum V mag ESPRESSO can observe is 17, and anything brighter (lower mag) is okay. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag. So for a star to be detectable by both, its V mag must be ≤16 because that's the stricter limit.

So any star with V mag ≤16 can be detected by both. Now, let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc. Wait, but absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. Since it's at 10 pc, its apparent V mag is the same as its absolute mag. So Star1 has V mag 15.5. That's less than 16, so it would be detected by both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. Wait, but the limit for HIRES is V mag ≤16. So Star2's apparent mag is 16.5, which is brighter than 16? Wait no, wait: wait, no, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So 16.5 is fainter than 16. So HI
