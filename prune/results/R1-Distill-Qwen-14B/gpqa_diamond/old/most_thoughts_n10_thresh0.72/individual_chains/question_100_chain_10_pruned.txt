Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, wait, C3H6... that's either propene or cyclopropane. But since it's undergoing bromination, I think it's more likely to be propene because cyclopropane bromination might be different. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, right? So when Compound A undergoes bromination in CCl4, it probably adds bromine across the double bond. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, wait, no. Wait, propene has a double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So that would form 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane, I think.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so that's probably an elimination reaction. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a base, it would eliminate to form an alkene. Wait, but with two adjacent Br atoms, elimination would happen, right? So when you have two leaving groups adjacent, the base would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product, Compound C, would be propene again, or maybe another isomer? Wait, but propene is CH2=CHCH3. Let me think: 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-
