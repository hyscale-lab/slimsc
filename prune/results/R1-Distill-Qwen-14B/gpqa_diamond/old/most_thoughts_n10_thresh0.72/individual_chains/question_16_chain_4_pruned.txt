Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter or some sort of stereogenic element. So I need to go through each compound and see if it has any chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry.

Let's list out the compounds one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, but-1-ene is an alkene with the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on each double bond carbon: for C1, it's Cl and two CH2 groups (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents changed). Wait, but the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1, and 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3) group on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, maybe I should draw it. Let's think: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro makes it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? But wait, no, because it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl group on C2. So the molecule would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is a double bond carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Let me think again. The structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But the substituents are 1-chloro and 2-methyl.
