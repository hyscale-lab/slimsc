Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum resolution required for the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of this particle X⁰. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

The decay given is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. I'm supposed to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are given in meters, so it's probably related to the length or distance the particles travel before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving at high speeds (like in a particle accelerator), the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So I probably need to calculate the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) first.

The Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass. Oh, right, because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²), but since the units here are GeV and GeV/c², maybe the c² terms cancel out.

So E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 times 8 is 27.28. So 27/3.41 is a bit less than 8. So approximately 7.91 or something like that.

Once I have gamma, the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. So τ = γ * τ₀ = (27/3.41) * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that.

But wait, I'm trying to find the distance the particle travels before decaying, because the resolution needed is about how precisely we can measure the decay point. The distance L would be v * τ, where v is the velocity of the particle. But since gamma is high, the velocity is close to the speed of light, so v ≈ c.

So L = γ * β * c * τ₀. Wait, another approach. Since beta (β) is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - β²). Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and p = γ m β c. But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, another formula: the mean path length (L) is gamma * c * tau_0 * beta. But beta can be found from gamma, as beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). But for large gamma, beta is approximately 1.

Alternatively, since gamma is about 7.9, let's compute beta. Let's see, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So 1/gamma² = 1
