Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, so that's the second one, β2=40.

Wait, no. Wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue ones. I'm a bit confused because sometimes the color changes with the number of SCN attached. I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ions, so Co(SCN)_2^2+. So β2 would be that one, right?

But wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato" which should be two SCN- ions. So that's the complex with two SCN. So β2 is 40.

Stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So each step is adding another SCN-.

The general approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then find the percentage for the desired one.

The formation of complexes can be represented as:
Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^2−(n−2), but I think the charges go like this: for each SCN added, the charge changes. Wait, maybe I should think about the stepwise formation.

Each β is the formation constant for adding one SCN at a time. So β1 is K1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^- / ([Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-]).

And so on. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^m is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But wait, the problem
