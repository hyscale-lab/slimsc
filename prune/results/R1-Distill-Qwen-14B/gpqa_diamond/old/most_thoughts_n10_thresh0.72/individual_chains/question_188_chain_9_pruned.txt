Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distanceâ€”oh right, that's the distance between adjacent atoms in the crystal structure. So in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, and c are all the same. But in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So does that mean a = b = c = 10 Angstroms? I think so because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter. But wait, rhombohedral is a bit more complex. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the atoms are at the corners of a cube that's been compressed along the space diagonal or something like that. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter. Let me go with that for now.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell has all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (alpha=beta=gamma). That's right, it's a special case of the hexagonal system or maybe a cubic system that's been distorted. Wait, no, rhomboh
