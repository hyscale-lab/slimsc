Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, I'll try to break down the reactions given. The problem describes several reactions, each involving different substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. I think the key is to figure out what each of these substances are by looking at the clues.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C. The product C is bright red. I'm thinking, what bright red compounds do I know? Maybe something like sulfur? Or perhaps a transition metal compound. Wait, another option: maybe it's a reaction involving lead dioxide or something else. Alternatively, could it be a metal oxide reacting with something else?

Wait, if A is a solid and B is a gas, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2 or O2. Let's think about the 8 equivalents part. If B is O2, and A is a metal, maybe it's a metal being oxidized. For example, if A is iron, and B is oxygen, but 8 equivalents seems a lot. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something like the production of lead dioxide, PbO2. Let me think about the reaction for that. Lead (Pb) with oxygen would form PbO2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is Fe, and B is Cl2. Iron reacts with chlorine gas in certain conditions. Iron(III) chloride is FeCl3, but I don't think that's red. Iron(II,III) oxide is Fe3O4, which is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a compound of copper. Copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe if it's in a different oxidation state. Alternatively, lead(IV) oxide is bright red. Yes, lead dioxide (PbO2) is a bright red-brown solid. So if A is lead (Pb) metal, and B is oxygen (O2), then the reaction would be Pb + O2 → PbO2. But let me check the stoichiometry. Let's see, the formation of PbO2 from Pb metal usually involves heating. The reaction is 2 Pb + O2 → 2 PbO. But wait, to get PbO2, perhaps it's Pb + 2 O2 → 2 PbO2? Hmm, maybe that's under different conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't just simple Pb and O2. Or perhaps A is another metal.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is something else. Or perhaps it's something else entirely. Let me think again about the product C being bright red. Oh! Maybe it's a nitro compound. Like nitrobenzene is reddish, but that's more of an organic compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal nitrate. Or perhaps it's a transition metal with a particular oxidation state.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to form A
