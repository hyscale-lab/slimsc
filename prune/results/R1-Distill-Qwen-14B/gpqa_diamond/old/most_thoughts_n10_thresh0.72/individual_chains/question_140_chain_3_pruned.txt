Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is around 4 degrees Celsius. The product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially because of its analog.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I think I should start by identifying what each part refers to.

First, let's think about gas W. Its molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So protons and neutrons are the same in count. Let's consider common gases. One possibility is CO2, but wait, that's a molecule with one carbon and two oxygens. Let's check: carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8 each. So CO2 would have (6) + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: carbon has 6 (since C-12 is common), oxygen has 8 each. So total neutrons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh, wait, that's the same as protons. So CO2 would fit, but wait, no, because CO2 has a molecule of 1 C and 2 O. Or maybe another gas.

Wait, another thought: could it be H2O? No, because H2O's molecule has 2 H and 1 O. So protons would be 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Neutrons: H has 0 (assuming H1), O has 8. So 2*0 + 8 =8. Protons 10, neutrons 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another common gas is NH3. Let's see: N has 7 protons, H has 1. So molecule has 1 N and 3 H: protons =7 +3*1=10. Neutrons: N has 7, H has 0. So 7 +0=7. Not equal. So no.

Wait, what about CH4? It has 1 C (protons 6) and 4 H (protons 4), so 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if it's C-12), H has 0. So 6 +0=6. Not equal.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like O2. O2 has 8 protons each, so 16 in total. Neutrons: each O has 8, so 16. Oh wait, that's equal. So W could be O2. But wait, O2 is diatomic, and when substances react, O2 is a product? Well, in some reactions, but maybe that's possible.

Wait, another option: maybe it's CO. Let's see: C has 6 protons, O has 8. So 6+8=1
