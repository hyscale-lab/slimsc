Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about reacting a disubstituted epoxide with an organocuprate, Me2CuLi. The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I need to find out which product is formed from this reaction.

Hmm, I remember that when epoxides react with nucleophiles like organocuprates, it's an example of ring-opening reactions. Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack epoxides in a specific manner. Oh right, the nucleophile (the cuprate) will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. But wait, in the case of disubstituted epoxides, there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.

Wait, the problem mentions that for saturated epoxides, the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. And specifically for disubstituted epoxides, there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where the Nu (nucleophile) adds. So I need to figure out which carbon that would be in the given epoxide.

Let me draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an oxygen at position 7. The substituents are 1R, 3R, 4R, and 6S. So, the bicyclo structure is like a norbornane system. Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1], but this is different. Wait, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a different structure. Let me think: the numbers in the bicyclo notation indicate the bridge lengths. So 4.1.0 means the bridge is between atoms 1-6, 3-4, and so on.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think of the structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have two bridgeheads. Let's see, the numbering starts at one bridgehead, goes around, and the other bridgehead is at position 6 maybe. So positions 1 and 6 are bridgeheads
