Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the major products for two reactions and choose the correct options. Let me break this down step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate using t-BuOK as a base. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's probably involved in some kind of elimination or maybe a Michael addition? Wait, ethyl acrylate is a Michael acceptor, right? So maybe this is a conjugate addition reaction.

Let me focus on the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the structure has the ketone at position 1, and substituents at 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). Wait, no, wait: wait, the numbering. So cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. The numbering would be such that the ketone is at position 1. Then, substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Oh, wait, the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Also, position 2 has another methyl? Wait, wait: the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So that means at position 2, there's both an ethyl and a methyl group attached. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl; position 6 has a methyl. The ketone is at position 1.

So the structure is cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 2 and 6. The substituents at 2 are ethyl and methyl, and at 6 is methyl.

Now, when reacting with ethyl acrylate (which is CH2=CHCOOEt) in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, I think this is a Michael addition. The Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound by a nucleophile. Wait, but wait, ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor, and the other component is the nucleophile. Alternatively, wait, no, in a typical Michael reaction, the enolate acts as the nucleophile attacking the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, so perhaps the starting ketone is undergoing enolate formation, and then attacking the ethyl acrylate.

Wait, but wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw the structure. So cyclohexane ring, with the ketone at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. Position 6 has a methyl group.

So positions 2 and 6 are both substituted. Now, when t-BuOK is added, it's a strong, bulky base that deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate will attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition.

Wait, but wait, in the Michael addition, the enolate of the ketone would attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. But wait, the ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor; the ketone's enolate is the nucleophile.

The position where the enolate forms is key. The base (t-BuOK) abstracts an alpha proton, forming the enolate. The question is, which alpha position is more likely to be deprotonated? The more substituted the enolate, the more stable it is. So the base will prefer
