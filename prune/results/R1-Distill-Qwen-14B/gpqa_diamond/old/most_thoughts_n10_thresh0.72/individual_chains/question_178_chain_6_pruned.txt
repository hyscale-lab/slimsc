Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of the coupling constants is important because it tells us about renormalizability.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian and make sure the entire expression has the correct dimension.

I remember that in four spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because the action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian, must be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Each field in the Lagrangian has its own mass dimension. Let's list them out:

- Fermion field ψ has dimension 3/2. Because for a Dirac spinor, the dimension is (d-1)/2 where d is the spacetime dimensions. So for d=4, 3/2.

- The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from the electromagnetic field, which is a gauge field. Gauge bosons (like photons) have dimension 1. But F is the field strength, which is the derivative of the vector potential. So each derivative ∂_μ brings a dimension of 1. Since F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, the dimension of F is [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The gauge field A has dimension 1, same as the spacetime dimension. Because the field strength is (∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ), each term is ∂μ (Aν), so each derivative adds one, so F^{μν} has dimension 1 (from A) + 1 (from derivative) = 2. Right.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices. The commutator [γμ, γν] is antisymmetric and has the same dimension as γ matrices. Wait, but gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless? Because when you write the Dirac equation, the terms should balance. The gamma matrices are treated as dimensionless in four dimensions.

So σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γμ, γν], which is a dimensionless object because the gamma matrices are dimensionless and the structure is just a combination of them. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Now, the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Breaking down each part:

ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have the product of three fields: ψ̄ (3/2), σ (0), ψ (3/2). So 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 = 3.

Then F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the whole term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3 + 2. But the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, so:

[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4 → [κ] = 4 - 5 → [κ] = -1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Let me think about the dimensions:

Each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ
