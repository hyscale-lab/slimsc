Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see. The question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Alright, let's break it down.

First, let's look at compound A's NMR spectrum. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us the number of protons. So 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. 

What structures have groups that split into triplets and quartets like that? Oh, wait. Maybe it's a di-substituted alkane. Let me think. The triplet (6H) at 0.9 ppm is usually indicative of CH3 groups attached to a carbon next to another CH2. The quartet (4H) at 1.3 ppm suggests a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. 

Wait, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylbutane or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. Hmm, wait, diethyl ether is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3, but the NMR would be different. Or maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, 6H as a triplet. So each of those 6H is part of a CH2CH3 group. Because a triplet for a CH3 would imply coupling with a CH2. Wait, the triplet (n+1 where n=2, so two neighboring protons) would mean each CH3 is next to a CH2. So 6H as triplet could be two CH3 groups each next to a CH2. So for example, if the structure is CH2CH2(C)(something), but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups.

Wait another thought: The triplet of 6H and quartet of 4H. Let's think about splitting. If we have a structure where two CH3 groups are attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH2
