Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state. Wait, that's the 3s orbital, right? It decays to the |1,0,0⟩ state, which is the 1s orbital. And it does this via two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions involve the emission or absorption of a photon, and they follow certain selection rules.

So, the possible transitions must adhere to the selection rules. For hydrogen, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the same applies for the allowed transitions from a higher state to a lower state. So, the initial state is 3s (n=3, l=0, m=0). It can't go directly to 1s because that would require a change in l of -2, which is not allowed. So it must go through an intermediate state where l changes by 1 each time.

Let me think about possible intermediate states. Starting from 3s, what states can it transition to? Since l starts at 0, the next possible is l=1 (p orbital). So possible transitions would be from 3s to a 2p state, or maybe 3s to a 4p? Wait, but the decay is to 1s. So the first step would go from 3s to 2p (n=2, l=1) or maybe to a higher n but lower l. But since it's decaying, probably lower n.

Wait, but the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions, so two steps. So from 3s (n=3, l=0, m=0) → first transition to some (n', l=1) state, then from there to (n'', l=0) state.

Wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0. So in the second transition, the state must go from l=1 to l=0. So the intermediate state has l=1.

So the first transition is 3s (n=3, l=0) → something with l=1, which could be 2p or 4p. But since I'm going to a lower energy state, probably 2p. Because 4p would be higher in energy than 3s, but wait, 3s is lower in energy than 4p? No, 4p has higher principal quantum number, but for hydrogen, higher n means higher energy. So 3s has higher energy than 2p? Wait, no, in hydrogen, the energy levels are determined by n. So 3s (n=3) has higher energy than 2p (n=2), which is correct for decay.

So 3s → 2p (n=2, l=1), then 2p → 1s (n=1, l=0). That makes sense.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0
