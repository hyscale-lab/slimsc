Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and NMR data. The reaction involves Compound X reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I think this is a ring-opening reaction, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, epoxides can open up with such bases to form other structures.

The product's NMR data is given both for 1H and 13C. I need to analyze these to deduce the structure of the starting material, Compound X.

Looking at the options, they are all some sort of oxirane (epoxide) derivatives. So maybe Compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is opening the epoxide ring, perhaps to form a diol or another structure.

Wait, but the product's NMR data is from the reaction product, not the starting material. So I need to figure out what the product looks like, then backtrack to find out what Compound X was.

Let me look at the 1H NMR of the product first:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, probably a CH3 group attached to something that doesn't split the peak. Maybe a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom or something that deshields it but doesn't cause splitting, like being part of a ring or something symmetric.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet. Two methyl groups, each as singlets. Maybe two different methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting.
- δ 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet, likely from a proton adjacent to another proton, maybe in a coupling situation. Could be part of a vinyl group or an aromatic ring. The downfield shift suggests maybe aromatic protons.
- δ 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe part of a coupling in an aromatic ring, like para-substituted, or adjacent to substituents.
- δ 7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet, possibly part of a vinyl group or a substituent on an aromatic ring.
- δ 7.71 (2H, d): Two protons, doublet. Could be part of an aromatic ring with substituents causing coupling.

The 13C NMR data is a bit more complex:

- δ 21.3 (1C, s): Probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Maybe a CH3 in a position where it's not near any coupling.
- δ 28.4 (1C, s): Another carbon, perhaps a CH2 or another CH3. A singlet suggests no neighboring carbons causing splitting. Maybe a quaternary carbon or a CH3 attached to something without adjacent carbons.
- The rest are in the aromatic region. Let's see:
   - 126.9 (2C, s): Two carbons as singlets. Could be carbons in an aromatic ring that are equivalent, maybe in a para position.
   - 127.1 (1C, s): Another aromatic carbon, perhaps part of a substituent.
   - 129.1 (2C, s): Two more aromatic carbons, maybe another set of equivalent positions.
   - 130.3 (1C, s): Another aromatic carbon, perhaps a quaternary one.
   - 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C, s): These are probably carbons attached to electronegative atoms or part of a conjugated system. Maybe carbons attached to oxygen or part of a double bond.
   - 197.7 (1C, s): Hmm, that's a very high chemical shift. Usually carbonyls are around 170-220, so maybe an ketone or an ester. Wait, but 197 is a bit high. Another possibility is an epoxide carbon, but wait, the product is after the reaction. Oh, wait, if the product is from an epoxide ring opening, perhaps this is a carbonyl group or something else.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is an epoxide. The reaction is with a strong base, which would typically open the epoxide. So the product would be a diol. But looking at the NMR, I don't see any broad peaks that are typical of OH groups. Hmm, maybe the solvent used in NMR is D2O, so the OH protons are exchanged and not visible? Or perhaps the product isn't a diol but something else.

Alternatively, the
