Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me break down the information given.

The main ring is a benzene, and it has a carboxylic acid group. Also attached are a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group, so -CHO) and a cyano group (-CN). These three groups are all meta to each other. Oh wait, meta means each is separated by one carbon, right? So if I imagine the benzene ring, each of these three substituents is at positions that are two apart from each other.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino group (N(CH3)2). Oh, wait, ortho means adjacent, so these two groups are next to the carboxylic acid. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3). Para is across the ring, so that's position 4 if the carboxylic acid is at position 1.

Additionally, the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are also both ortho to the nitrile. So the -OCH3 and -OH groups are ortho to the -CN group. Hmm, that might help in determining their positions.

Wait, let me try to draw this in my mind. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the substituents meta to it would be positions 3 and 5. But wait, the problem says all three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano) are meta to each other. Oh wait, no, the question states that all three are meta to one another. So the three substituents (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, cyano) are each meta to each other. That means they are positioned such that each is two carbons apart from the others.

Wait, but benzene has six positions. If all three are meta, I think that might form a sort of triangular arrangement. Let me think: in a benzene ring, three substituents can be arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern, which would make each adjacent in a meta fashion. So
