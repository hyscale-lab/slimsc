Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2.

The problem says both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So, the orbital period of each system is 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

Then there's information about radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Radial velocity methods are used to detect exoplanets, right? But here, it's about binary stars. The RV method measures how much the star moves towards and away from us due to the orbit. The amplitude is the maximum velocity observed.

I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star would have a smaller orbit because it's closer to the center of mass. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the center of mass is the balance point between the two masses. So the more massive star will orbit a smaller circle, and the less massive one will have a larger orbit. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because if one is more massive, it doesn't need to move as much for the system to balance.

So, let's think: in the RV curves, the more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude. Because the velocity is inversely related to mass. So in system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. Let's say star A has 10 km/s and star B has 5. So their velocities are in a 2:1 ratio. That would imply their masses are in the inverse ratio, so 1:2. So system_1's total mass would be m1 + m2 = m + 2m = 3m.

Similarly, system_2's RVs are 15 and 10. So the velocities are in a 3:2 ratio. So masses would be in a 2:3 ratio. So system_2's total mass would be 2m +3m=5m.

Wait wait,
