Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Let me think step by step.

Alright, the question gives me a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field point is r, and there's this vector d which is from the point where the field was generated at some earlier time tr to the observation point r. The velocity at that time tr is v.

I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential is V, and the vector potential is A, which are used in the potentials formulation of electromagnetism.

So, the scalar potential V for a static charge is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, maybe it's not exactly that because of relativistic effects or because the fields are retarded.

Wait, right! Retarded potentials. Since the fields observed at time t are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, we have to consider the retarded time. But how does that affect V and A?

In the context of retarded potentials, the expressions for V and A involve the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. But the problem here seems to give expressions that might already account for that through the vector d and velocity v.

The vector d is from the field generation point (at tr) to r. So d would be r - s(tr), right? Because the field was generated when the charge was at s(tr), and we're observing it at r, so the vector between those is d = r - s(tr).

Now, for a moving charge, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity. For the scalar potential V, I think it's still similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded position. So V would be q/(4πε₀ d'), where d' is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r. Wait, but wait, let me think again. No, the distance between them is just |d|, so d is the vector, and the magnitude is |d| = sqrt(d·d).

Wait, but in the options, in option C and D, the denominators have terms like (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). Hmm, that doesn't look like the usual expression I remember.

Wait, let's think about the retarded time. The retarded time tr is the time it takes for the effects of the charge's motion to reach the observer. So tr = t - |r - s(tr)| / c. But that's a bit circular because s(tr) is the position at tr, which is the time when the charge was at that position.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potentials in terms of the Lienard potentials. For a moving charge, the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (1/(r')) ) ] evaluated at the retarded time.

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v' × r')/(r'^3) ) ] evaluated at the retarded time, but I might be mixing up the terms.

Wait, no, I think the vector potential A is given by A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) ∫ (v(t') × r')/(r')³ dt', but maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, but the question gives the velocity v at the field generating instant tr. So, perhaps the vector potential is proportional to the velocity of the charge at that time.

Let me think about the standard expressions for potentials due to a point charge in motion. The scalar potential V is the same as the static case but at the retarded position. So V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ |d|), since d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So |d| is the distance between the charge and the observation point at the retarded time.

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) times something. And I remember that the vector potential due to a moving charge is related to the velocity. In the simplest case, A might be something like (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) or similar.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is (v/c²) V. So that would make A proportional to v times V, but scaled by 1/c².

But wait, let's think about units. The scalar potential V has units of volts (which are J/C or N·m/C). The vector potential A has units of T·m (tesla-meter), which is equivalent to (kg/(C·s))·m = kg·m/(C·s).

Looking at option B: A would be (v * V) / c². Let's check the units. v has units m/s. V is (N·m²/C) because V is q/(4πε₀ r), so V has units (C/(4πε₀)) * (1/m). So 1/(4πε₀) has units (C/V·m). So V is (C * (V·m)) / (m) )? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate the units of each option.

Option B: V is q/(4πε₀ r). q is in coulombs (C). ε₀ is F/m (C²/(N·m²)). So 1/(4πε₀) is (N·m²)/(C²). So V is (C * (N·m²/C²)) / r. So V's units are (N·m²/C) / m = (N·m)/C = (kg·m/s² · m)/C = kg·m²/(s²·C) = (J·s)/(C·m) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach: The electric potential from a point charge is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/r. So units: [V] = [q]/([ε₀][r]) = (C) / ( (C²/(N·m²)) * m ) ) = C * N·m²/(C² m) ) = (N·m²)/(C·m) ) = (N·m)/(C) = (J)/(C) which is correct for volts.

Now, A in option B is (v/c²) V. The velocity v is m/s, c² is (m²/s²). So (v/c²) is (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) = (s/m).

So (v/c²) * V. V's units are J/C. So (s/m) * (J/C) = (J·s)/(C·m). Hmm, what's the unit for A? A is Tesla·m. Tesla is kg/(s²·C), so Tesla·m is kg·m/(s²·C). So let's see: J is kg·m²/s². So (J·s)/(C·m) = (kg·m²/s² * s) )/(C·m) = (kg·m²/s) )/(C·m) ) = kg·m/(s·C). Hmm, that's not matching Tesla·m's unit (kg·m/(s²·C)).

Wait, so that suggests that option B's units don't match. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Looking at option C: V is qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)). Let's look at the units. Let me compute the denominator: d is a vector, but in the expression, d c is (m)(m/s) )= m²/s. Hmm, but the denominator is (d c - d·v). Wait, the units here are a bit tricky. Because d is a vector, but in the denominator, it's being multiplied by c and subtracted from another term.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the expressions for the potentials.

I remember that when a charge is moving, the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d| ), and the vector potential A is (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v × d̂ )/(c² |d| ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (d̂ ) / (|d| (1 + (v·d̂)/c² )) or something like that.

Wait, but perhaps the potentials are given by the Lienard formula. The scalar potential is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/|d| ] multiplied by 1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c ), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. Because the term (v·d̂)/c would be the component of the velocity in the direction of the observation point.

Alternatively, another way: The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ), where d is the distance from the charge's position to the observation point at time tr. Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v/(c²)) * (1/(d (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ) ).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)). Let me see: d c is (vector d) multiplied by c, but that doesn't make sense in terms of units. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think about the denominator.

Wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v). Let me compute this: d is a vector, so d c would be a vector multiplied by scalar c, giving another vector. But d · v is a scalar (since it's the dot product of vectors d and v). So (d c - d · v) is a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense dimensionally. Hmm, that can't be right. So option C's expression doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, maybe it's a typo, and they mean (d c - (d · v) ) ? Wait, no, that still wouldn't make sense. Wait, perhaps they meant (d × v) or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) but that would still have different units.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let me think again.

The vector d is from the field generation point (at tr) to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr). So the magnitude is |d|.

The denominator in option C is (d c - (d · v)). That would be (vector d) multiplied by c (a scalar) minus the dot product of d and v. So the denominator would be a vector minus a scalar, which is not possible. So perhaps this option is incorrect, unless the actual expression is using |d| times c minus d·v.

Wait, wait, perhaps the denominator is written as (d c - (d·v)), but in reality, it's |d| times c minus (d · v). Because |d| is a scalar, so |d| c is a scalar, and (d · v) is also a scalar. So maybe the denominator is |d| c - (d · v).

If that's the case, then option C would have V = (q c) / [4πε₀ ( |d| c - (d · v) ) ].

Wait, but in the option C as written, the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), which would be a vector minus a scalar, so that's not possible. So perhaps option C is not correct in terms of units.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is |d| c - (d · v), which is a scalar. Then the units would make sense.

But looking at the options, option C is written as (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}), so it's d c (vector) minus the scalar (d · v). That can't be right. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Similarly, option D has the denominator (d c + (d · v)), which also would be a vector plus a scalar, which is invalid.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about another approach.

Another approach: the scalar potential V is due to the charge, and the vector potential A is due to the current (moving charge). For a point charge, the current is the charge times the velocity, but perhaps in some form.

Wait, the potentials can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / |d| ] * [ 1 / (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, in the case of a moving charge, the potentials might be affected by the motion. So perhaps the correct expressions involve terms with v.

Wait, looking at the answer options, options B and D have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is the static case. But since the charge is moving, perhaps the potential isn't just that.

Wait, but the problem says that the charge is moving, and we need to find the potentials at time t where t>tr. So the potentials should account for the retarded time.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials can be found using the Liénard expressions.

In the Liénard formula, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) [ (1 / r') / (1 - (v' · r̂')/c ) ] evaluated at the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v' × r̂') / ( r'² (1 - (v' · r̂')/c )) ] evaluated at the retarded time.

But in this problem, the vector d is from the charge's position at tr (s(tr)) to r. So r' = |d|, and v' is the velocity at tr, which is given as v.

Hmm, but how to relate this. Let me think, perhaps the denominator in V is r' (1 - (v' · r̂')/c ), which would be (r' (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Wait, but if d = r - s(tr), then r' = |d|, and d̂ is d / r'.

So the denominator becomes r' (1 - (v · (d/r')) / c ) = r' ( 1 - (v · d) / (c r') ) = [ r' c - (v · d) ] / c.

So the reciprocal is c / [ r' c - (v · d) ].

So putting it all together, V would be [ q/(4πε₀) ) ] * [ 1/r' ] * c / [ r' c - (v · d) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't look like any of the options, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in V is [ r' (1 - (v · d̂)/c^2 ) ].

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the potentials' expressions when the charge is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) ) * something.

Wait, looking at option B: A = (v/c²) V. So substituting V = q/(4πε₀ r), then A would be (v/(4πε₀ c² r)) q.

But the units for A would be (m/s) * [ (C/(4πε₀ r) ) ] / c². Wait, let's compute the units again.

Wait, V is in volts (J/C). A has units of Tesla·m, which is (kg/(s²·C))·m = kg·m/(s²·C).

Alternatively, let's compute option B's A:

A = (v/c²) * V.

v has units m/s, c² is m²/s². So (v/c²) is (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) = s/m.

V is in volts (J/C). So (s/m) * (J/C) = (J·s)/(C·m). J is kg·m²/s², so:

(kg·m²/s² * s )/(C·m) ) = kg·m/(s·C).

But A's unit is kg·m/(s²·C). So this doesn't match. So option B's units are wrong. So it can't be option B.

Looking at option C, as written, the denominator has (d c - d · v), which is a vector minus a scalar, so that's not possible. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D's denominator is (d c + d · v), which is also a vector plus a scalar. So that's invalid, so option D is also incorrect in terms of units.

Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me recheck.

Option C: V(r,t) = (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - (d . v)) ), and A is (mu_0 q c v)/(4 pi (d c - (d . v)) )

Hmm, but wait, in option C, the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), which is a vector multiplied by a scalar (c) minus a scalar (dot product). That would give a vector minus a scalar, which is dimensionally inconsistent. So this can't be correct.

So perhaps the correct option is option B, despite the unit mismatch, but I've probably made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the expressions in the options are using |d| instead of d as a vector. So perhaps the denominator is |d| c - (d · v), which is a scalar.

Wait, let me think. Let me assume that in the denominator, it's |d| c - (d · v). So for option C, V would be [ q c ] / [4 π ε₀ ( |d| c - (d · v) ) ].

Similarly, the vector potential in option C is [ μ₀ q c v ] / [4 π ( |d| c - (d · v) ) ].

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Let me check the units for this adjusted version.

For V in option C:

Numerator: q c → (C)(m/s)

Denominator: ( |d| c - (d · v) ) → (m)(m/s) - (m)(m/s) → m²/s. So denominator is m²/s.

So V has units (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) → (C m/s) * (s/m²) ) → C/(m). Wait, but V should be in volts (J/C), which is (N·m)/C → (kg·m²/s² · m)/C → kg·m²/(s² C). 

Wait, option C's V has units (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) = (C m/s) * (s/m²) ) = C/(m). That's not correct. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of c somewhere. Let me think about the correct expressions.

Wait, the correct expression for the scalar potential due to a moving charge should include a factor that accounts for the relative motion. The scalar potential is similar to the static case but with a Lorentz factor involved. So V is (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ) ].

Wait, that makes sense because the denominator includes a term that corrects for the motion.

Similarly, the vector potential A would be (μ₀ q/(4π)) [ (v × d̂ ) / ( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ) ].

But in the options given, none of them seem to directly match. So perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: the vector potential A is related to the magnetic dipole, but for a point charge, the magnetic field is due to the current, which is the charge's velocity. But perhaps the vector potential is (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi) times something, like the direction from the charge to the observer.

Wait, but in terms of (v × r), perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials can be expressed as follows:

V = q/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d|) * [1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ]

A = (mu_0 q v )/(4 pi |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) )

But in the options, option C has A proportional to (v) and V proportional to (c), which doesn't quite line up.

Wait, perhaps option C's V is (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 ( |d| c - (d·v) ) ), because that would make the denominator |d| c - (d · v). Let me compute the units for that:

Denominator is |d| c (m * m/s) → m²/s. And (d · v) is (m)(m/s) → m²/s. So denominator has units m²/s.

So V = (q c)/( ... ) → (C * m/s) / (m²/s) ) → (C * m/s ) * (s/m² ) → C/(m).

But that's not correct; V should be in volts (J/C). So perhaps the denominator is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm considering the denominator. Let me think again.

Looking at the options, only option B has the correct form for V: V = q/(4 pi epsilon_0 r), which is the static case. But since the charge is moving, perhaps that's not the case, unless in the non-relativistic limit, where the velocity is much smaller than c.

But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the potentials are in their standard static forms. But that can't be right because the charge is moving, so the potentials should account for that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B because it presents the standard form of V and a proportional A to velocity. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another thought: the potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. So, for a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials would be such that they produce the correct E and B fields.

The electric field is E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the magnetic field is B = ∇×A.

In the case of a moving charge, the dominant fields are the electric and magnetic fields due to its motion. The scalar potential should account for the electric field, and the vector potential for the magnetic field.

Wait, but when the charge is moving, the electric field isn't just due to the scalar potential anymore. There's also a term from the time derivative of A.

Hmm, perhaps this is leading me away from the initial question. Let me think of the given options.

Option C and D have expressions where V is scaled by c and the denominator is a combination of terms involving d and v. The vector potential in option C is (mu_0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c - d·v) ), which could make sense if the denominator is |d| c - (d ·v), which is a scalar.

If that's the case, then the units would be:

Numerator: mu_0 q c v → (H/m) * C * m/s * m/s → H is Ω·m, and Ω is V/A. Let me compute:

mu_0 has units H/m = (V·s)/(A·m²). So:

mu_0 * q → (V·s/(A·m²)) * C → (V·s * C)/(A·m²). But C is A·s, so substituting, (V·s * A·s)/(A·m²) ) → (V·s²)/(m²).

Multiply by c (m/s): (V·s²)/(m²) * (m/s) ) → (V·s)/(m).

Multiply by v (m/s): (V·s)/(m) * (m/s) ) → V.

Denominator: |d| c - (d · v) → m * m/s - m * m/s → m²/s.

So overall, A would have units (V) / (m²/s) ) = V·s/m². Wait, but A's units are T·m, which is (kg/(s²·C))·m → kg·m/(s²·C). Hmm, this doesn't align with the calculation. Maybe I'm making a mistake in unit analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when the charge is moving, the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity of the charge. So the vector potential should have a term involving v, and the scalar potential is the same as the static case but modified by a factor due to motion.

Looking again at the options, option B is the only one where V is the static case and A is proportional to v. But earlier unit analysis suggested that option B's A has incorrect units.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but the unit analysis was incorrect. Let me recheck.

Option B: V = q/(4 π ε₀ r), and A = (v/c²) V.

So A = (v/(c²)) * (q/(4 π ε₀ r)).

Units for A: velocity (m/s) * V/(c²). V is in volts, which is J/C = (N·m)/C = (kg·m²/s²·m)/C → kg·m/(s²·C).

So A's units would be (m/s) * [kg·m/(s²·C)] / (m²/s²) ) → (m/s) * [kg·m/(s²·C)] * (s²/m²) ) → (m/s) * (kg·m·s²)/(C·m²) ) → (kg·m²·s)/(C·m²·s) ) → kg/(C).

Wait, but the correct units for A are Tesla·m = (kg/(s²·C))·m → kg·m/(s²·C).

Hmm, that doesn't match, so option B's units are incorrect, which means option B can't be the right answer.

Now I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of the other options.

Option C: V = (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - (d · v) ) )

Assuming that the denominator is |d| c - (d · v), which is a scalar.

So V's denominator is |d| c - (d · v) → m*(m/s) - m*(m/s) → m²/s.

So V's units: (C * m/s) / (m²/s) → (C * m/s) * (s/m²) ) → C/(m).

Which is not correct for volts. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: denominator is |d| c + (d · v), similar reasoning. Units are same as above, leading to incorrect units.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/c. Let me think about the potentials.

Another approach: The potentials for a moving charge can be written as:

V(r, t) = ( q/(4 pi epsilon_0) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c )) ]

A(r, t) = ( mu_0 q/(4 pi) ) * [ v × d̂ ) / ( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c )) ]

But this doesn't directly match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are written as:

V = (q c) / (4 pi epsilon_0 (|d| c - (d · v)) )

A = (mu_0 q v) / (4 pi (|d| c - (d · v)) )

Which would match option C if |d| c is in the denominator correctly.

So the denominator would be |d| c - (d · v) → m*(m/s) - m*(m/s) → m²/s.

So V would be (C * m/s) / (m²/s) ) → C/(m) → which is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of the correct expressions for V and A.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is:

V(r, t) = ( q/(4 pi epsilon_0) ) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c )) ]

Similarly, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = ( mu_0 q/(4 pi) ) * ( v ) / ( c² (1 - (v · d̂)/c )) )

Wait, no, I think the vector potential is (mu_0 q v)/(4 pi c²) * [ 1 / (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ].

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential A is (mu_0 q v )/(4 pi c²) * (1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c )).

In that case, substituting into option C or D.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v × d) ), but that's not the case either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the potentials leading to the correct E and B fields.

The electric field due to a moving charge is E = E_electric + E_magnetic. The scalar potential gives the electric field as E = -∇V, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field via B = ∇×A.

But for a moving charge, the dominant fields are the electric field (due to the charge) and the magnetic field (due to its motion). So the potentials must account for both.

In the end, after a lot of thinking, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the options, option C seems to have the correct structure with both V and A depending on the denominator (d c - d · v), which I think relates to the term (1 - (v · d̂)/c ), considering that d̂ is d/|d|.

So I'll go with option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the principles of electromagnetism and the retarded potential formalism.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a stationary charge, the scalar potential is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the field point.
   - For a moving charge, the scalar potential must account for the retarded time \( t_r \), which depends on the charge's position and velocity at \( t_r \). The general form of \( V \) involves a correction factor due to the motion of the charge, often expressed as \( V \propto \frac{1}{1 - (v \cdot \hat{d})/c} \), where \( \hat{d} \) is the unit vector from the charge to the observation point.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and is typically expressed as \( \vec{A} \propto \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \) or similar forms, depending on the specific formulation.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the standard form of the vector potential, as it should depend linearly on \( \vec{v} \). This option is incorrect.
   - **Option B:** The scalar potential is correct for a static charge, \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \). However, the vector potential \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \) has incorrect units. The units of \( \vec{A} \) should be \( \text{Tesla} \cdot \text{meter} \), but this expression does not match. This option is incorrect.
   - **Option C:** The scalar potential is \( V = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), and the vector potential is \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \). Here, \( d \) is the distance between the charge and the observation point, and \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) accounts for the motion. The denominator \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) aligns with the retarded potential formalism, where \( 1 - (v \cdot \hat{d})/c \) is a correction factor. This option is consistent with the expected form of the potentials.
   - **Option D:** Similar to Option C, but the denominator has a \( + \) sign instead of a \( - \). This would lead to incorrect behavior for the potentials, as the denominator must account for the retarded time correction. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Option C correctly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion and satisfies the expected form of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge.

**Answer: C**
