Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms yet. But let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and think about what's happening.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C, it forms product 1. The NMR data for product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet probably from an -OH group or something similar. Wait, but KOH is a strong base; maybe it's an elimination reaction. Wait, dibromides when treated with a base can undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming alkenes. But adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so maybe it's eliminating two bromides to form an alkene.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, if each bromine is on adjacent carbons, eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between the two carbons. That would give me 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the product might be a ring-strained alkene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's forming a ketone, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Oh wait, that's a strong peak, probably a ketone or ester. So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution.

Wait, when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but if the molecule has two leaving groups, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, another possibility is that KOH could deprotonate something. Hmm.

Wait, the product's IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is around where ketones absorb. So maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanedione or something similar. So, each Br is replaced by an OH group? No, because the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Wait, but in the NMR, 4.79 ppm is a sing
