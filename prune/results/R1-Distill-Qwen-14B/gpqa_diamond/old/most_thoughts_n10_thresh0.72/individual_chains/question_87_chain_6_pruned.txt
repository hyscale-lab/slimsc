Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, wait, di-substituted aromatic ring. So the ring has two substituents. The ring is 6-membered, so it's benzene or similar. The total carbons are 8. Let me think: benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 more. But wait, the substituents might be more complex. Alternatively, if the substituents are attached to the ring, each substituent could contribute more carbons.

Wait, the substituents are so that the entire molecule has 8 carbons. So the ring is 6, and substituents add 2. Or perhaps each substituent adds one? Let's see. But wait, the substituents could have more carbons if they're like, say, a methyl group (but that's one carbon) or an acyl group (like a ketone, which would have more carbons). 

The IR has a carbonyl group. So that's a C=O stretch. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond. So that's probably a halogen attached to the ring, like Cl, Br, etc. So one substituent is a halogen, the other is a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, so the di-substituted benzene has two groups: one is a halogen (like Cl, Br) and the other is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde. Alternatively, the carbonyl could be part of another functional group, like an ester or an acyl chloride.

Wait but the substituents have to contribute to the total of 8 carbons. The benzene ring has 6, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Hmm, but a carbonyl group like a ketone (RCOR') would have more carbons. Wait,
