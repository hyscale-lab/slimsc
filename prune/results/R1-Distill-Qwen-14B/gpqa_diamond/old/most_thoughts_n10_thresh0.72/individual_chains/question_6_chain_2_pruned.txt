Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's try to take it step by step.

The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions under a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, it's often useful to use polar coordinates because the potential here depends on r and θ. 

Wait, what's the setup? The particle is moving in two dimensions, so the potential is in polar coordinates. The Hamiltonian for a particle in such a setup would include kinetic and potential energy terms. The kinetic energy in polar coordinates has terms involving the radial and angular momenta. But wait, the potential here seems to have an angular component as well because of the cos²θ term. Does that mean the potential isn't spherically symmetric? Because spherical symmetry would have the potential depend only on r, not θ.

So the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor that differently. Maybe I can write it as V(r,θ) = (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Oh, right, that could be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite it using trigonometric identities. I remember that cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me try that.

So substituting, V(r,θ) becomes (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ] = (k r²/2) [1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] → (k r²/2)(5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ) → (5 k r²)/(4) + (3 k r² cos2θ)/(4).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of angular momentum or other operators. Wait, maybe I should think about the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is H = (- (ℏ²)/(2m) ) [
