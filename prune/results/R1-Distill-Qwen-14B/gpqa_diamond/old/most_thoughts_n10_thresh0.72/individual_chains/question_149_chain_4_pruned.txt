Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question about a peptidic compound. Let's read through the problem again and think about each part.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except for two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So, that probably means each peak is about the same size but maybe a little less than a full proton each. But wait, together they integrate to 1H. So maybe each is 0.5H? Hmm.

The problem also says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason for the duplicate peaks. Spin-spin coupling (like between two adjacent protons) would typically result in splitting into multiple peaks, but here it's just two peaks. So that's not the issue.

Then, looking at LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as expected. So the mass is the same for both, but they are two distinct peaks. Since LC-MS is showing two peaks, maybe it's a matter of retention timeâ€”like they are two different compounds or conformations?

So the options given are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that's the case, the mass would be different. The precursor would have a higher mass, perhaps. But the question says both LC-MS peaks have the same mass as expected. So that's probably not the case. So A is less likely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so the mass in LC-MS would match. But what about NMR? Enantiomers typically don't split into multiple peaks because they are mirror images. Wait, in NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, you might not see any splitting in the NMR if the environment is the same for both enantiomers, but maybe in some cases, like if the protons are in a chiral environment. But wait, the question says that the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. How would that happen with enantiomers?

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not entirely sure what 'double coupling' means here. Maybe it refers to some kind of coupling in the reaction that leads to two different products. Or perhaps it's a term referring to something like a side reaction where two bonds form, leading to two different structures. But I'm not very clear on this option.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR spectra. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. How does that work? Let's think. If the molecule has a stereocenter that is not resolved, maybe it's a diastereomeric mixture. For example, if the alpha-proton is in a chiral environment, the diastereomers would lead to different chemical shifts. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would have a different shift for that proton, leading to two separate peaks. But why would the integrals add up to 1H? Because the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, each contributing one alpha-proton. So in the NMR, each peak would integrate to 0.5H, but together they sum to 1H. That makes sense.

Wait, but diastereomers would also have different physical properties, so their retention times in LC-MS would be different. But in the problem, LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. Diastereomers have the same molecular weight but different structures, so their mass would be the same. So this could fit.

Alternatively, thinking about Option B again: enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight. In the NMR, if the two enantiomers have the same environment for that alpha-proton (like if it
