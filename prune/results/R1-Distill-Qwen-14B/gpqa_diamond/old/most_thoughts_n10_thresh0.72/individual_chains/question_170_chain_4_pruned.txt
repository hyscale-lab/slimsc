Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again. The question says that an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, which is S_y. The options are given, so hopefully, after working through it, I can pick the right one.

First, I remember that expectation values in quantum mechanics involve the operator corresponding to the observable we're measuring. So for spin in the y-direction, the operator is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because the Pauli matrices are the operators for spin, and each component (x, y, z) has its own matrix. Oh wait, right, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The spin state given is (3i, 4). I'm assuming this is a column vector, so it's like (3i, 4) written as a two-element vector. So the state can be represented as a vector χ = [3i; 4]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Do I need to normalize it here? Hmm, because the expectation value involves the inner product, and if the state isn't normalized, I might have to account for that. Let me think: the expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. But wait, no—wait, the state given might not be normalized. So I should check that first.

So, the state vector is [3i; 4], and I need to compute its norm. The norm squared is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = (9*(-i^2)) + 16. Since i^2 is -1, so (3i)(-3i) is 9*(-(-1)) = 9*1=9. Adding 16 gives 25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, the normalized state would be [3i/5; 4/5]. But wait, in this problem, does the state need to be normalized to get the expectation value? Because expectation values are computed using the actual state, so if it's not normalized, the expectation would be ⟨S_y⟩ = [ (3i, 4) * (S_y) * (3i,4) ] divided by the norm squared, I think. Or wait, because the expectation is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, which is (1/25) times the dot product as is, because the vector is (3i,4) so when you take the inner product, it's the conjugate transpose times S_y times the vector.

Wait, maybe I should proceed step by step without worrying about normalization for a moment. Let's just compute the expectation value in any case.

So, S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. And σ_y is given as the matrix:
0  -i
i   0

So, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. So to compute ⟨S_y⟩, I need
