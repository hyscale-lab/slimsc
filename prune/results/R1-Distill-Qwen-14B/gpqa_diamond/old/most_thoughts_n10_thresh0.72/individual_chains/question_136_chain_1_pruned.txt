Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. We have four options to choose from: A to D.

Hmm, I remember that divergence relates to the sources or sinks of a vector field. But wait, for this specific case, since the field is radial and depends only on r, maybe it's similar to the electric field of a point charge or something like that.

Wait, the divergence theorem comes to mind. Oh right, the divergence theorem connects the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

But wait, let me think step by step. Maybe I should compute the divergence first before jumping to the theorem.

So, in spherical coordinates, since the field is radial and has only a radial component, the divergence formula should simplify. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component (A_r) and zero angular components (A_θ, A_φ) is given by:

∇·A = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r).

So substituting A_r = f(r) = 1/r², let me compute that.

So, A_r = 1/r².

Then, ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Wait, let's compute the derivative inside. r² * (1/r²) is r²*(r^-2) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at r=0. But wait, what happens at r=0? Because at r approaching zero, the field f(r) would blow up as 1/r², which might suggest a point source or something. But in
