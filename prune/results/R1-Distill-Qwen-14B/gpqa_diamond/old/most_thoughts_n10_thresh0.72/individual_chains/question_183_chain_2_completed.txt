Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (or IHD) is a concept that relates to the degree of unsaturation in a molecule. Each degree of unsaturation represents a ring or a double bond. So the IHD is calculated using the formula:

IHD = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X the halogens, and N the nitrogens. But since this molecule doesn't have any halogens or nitrogens, I can ignore X and N.

So first, I need to figure out the structure of the starting material and what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw this out as best as I can.

The cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. Oh, wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, so it's CH2CH2? No, no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the group is attached as CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. The substituent is a vinyl group, which is -CH2CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-. So the substituent is attached via a double bond. So the substituent is -CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The structure of cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group. But in this case, it's 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3 (between C3 and C4?), and then substituents at position 2 (formyl) and position 5 (vinyl). So the ring is numbered such that the double bond is between C3 and C4. Then, at C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl group (which is CH2CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- but attached where? Oh wait, when a vinyl group is attached to a cyclohexene, it's as CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. No, wait, the substituent is CH2CH2? No, no, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH2CH2 group with a double bond. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the substituent is -CH2CH2, but with a double bond between the two carbons.

Wait, maybe it's better to sketch this mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (cyclohex-3-ene). Then, at position 2, which is adjacent to C3, there's a formyl group (CHO attached to C2). At position 5, which is across from position 2, there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, which would be a CH2-CH2 group but with a double bond in between, so -CH2CH2? No, wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so when attached to the cyclohexene, it's as a substituent at C5. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with carboxylic acid at position 1 (since it's cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid: the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, substituents at 2 and 5: formyl and vinyl.

Wait, maybe I should write down the structure:

Positions 1 (carboxylic acid), 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond starts), 4 (end of double bond), 5 (vinyl group), and 6.

So the ring is numbered with the carboxylic acid at position 1. Then, moving clockwise, position 2 (CHO), position 3 (start of double bond), position 4 (end of double bond), position 5 (vinyl group), and position 6.

So, the substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl group) are on adjacent carbons? Wait, 2 and 5 are opposite each other on the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the cyclohexene as a six-membered ring with a double bond from C3 to C4. Then, the carboxylic acid is at C1. The formyl group is at C2, and the vinyl group is at C5.

So the structure is cyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylic acid, with a formyl group at C2 and a vinyl group at C5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that this is a reaction where red phosphorus and HI are used to effect the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe the cleavage of certain groups. Wait, another thought: maybe it's related to the Clemmensen reduction. Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, right? Red phosphorus with HI—I think that's the reaction that reduces alkenes or alkynes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deoxygenation reaction.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to remove oxygen from certain functional groups. Like, maybe it's a Baeyer reaction or something else. Alternatively, I've heard of the use of PHi3 for certain reductions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think that when we have ketones or aldehydes, treating with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of alkanes. For example, the reduction of ketones to alkanes via the Baeyer reduction, but I'm not too certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that uses hydrazine and heat, not HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, I remember that when alkenes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can lead to the addition of HI across the double bond. Wait, but in this case, the starting material has multiple double bonds, so perhaps that's happening.

Wait, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond in the ring, between C3 and C4), and a vinyl group (another double bond) at C5. So that's two double bonds already. Also, the formyl group is a carbonyl (another double bond, but as a CHO group). So, IHD for the starting material would be higher.

But the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, what's happening in that reaction?

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is cleaving the double bonds. For example, cleavage of the cyclohexene ring, or the vinyl group.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or some other elimination. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that uses ketones and an oxidizing agent, not HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation. For example, converting carbonyl groups (like the formyl group) into CH2 groups. I remember that in the presence of strong reducing agents, aldehydes can be reduced to CH2OH, but in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, another possibility: the formyl group (CHO) can undergo a reaction with HI and red phosphorus. Let me think about the possible reaction of formyl groups with HI.

Alternatively, I recall that when an aldehyde is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can form an alkane. Like, the aldehyde group is converted to CH2 group. Similarly, ketones might also be reduced, but I'm not sure.

So, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH2I, but in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's further reduced. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the carbonyl is replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is breaking the ring. Because the starting material is a cyclohexene ring, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. If the reaction opens the ring, that would reduce the IHD.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a dihydroxylation, but that's usually with osmium tetroxide. Alternatively, the addition of HI across the double bonds.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening via addition of HI. For example, the cyclohexene ring (which has a double bond) could react with HI in a ring-opening reaction. But I'm not sure which conditions lead to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the double bonds. For instance, ozonolysis would cleave double bonds, but that's not the reagent here.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a reduction of the double bonds. Reducing the cyclohexene ring's double bond would convert it into a single bond, thereby reducing the IHD. Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond would be reduced.

So, let's think about the possible products. The starting material has three double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (C3-C4), another in the vinyl group (C5's substituent, which is a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond), and the formyl group (CHO) which has a double bond between C and O.

Wait, actually, the formyl group is a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's another double bond. So the starting material has three double bonds: two in the ring and substituents, and one in the formyl group.

Wait, no, the cyclohexene has a double bond (1), the vinyl group has another double bond (2), and the formyl group has a double bond (3). So three double bonds.

So the IHD of the starting material would be 3 (from the three double bonds) plus any rings. The cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond, which contributes 1 ring (or is it considered as a ring plus a double bond? Wait, the IHD counts each ring and each double bond as one. So a cyclohexene has a ring (1) and a double bond (1) ⇒ IHD is 2 for the cyclohexene itself.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The IHD is calculated based on the entire molecule, not just the rings and double bonds. So for the starting material, let's calculate the IHD.

But perhaps instead of that, I should first figure out what happens in the reaction.

Assuming that the reaction reduces the double bonds, so each double bond would become a single bond. So the cyclohexene's double bond is reduced to a single bond (so the ring remains a cyclohexane), the vinyl group's double bond is reduced to a single bond, and the formyl group's carbonyl is reduced to CH2OH or something else.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So maybe the carbonyl group (CHO) is being converted into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the formyl and vinyl groups.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a formyl group with HI and red phosphorus. I think that the formyl group (CHO) can be reduced to CH2I, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's converted into CH2OH, but with HI, maybe it's more substitution.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group. For example, using a strong reducing agent like red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group (CHO) could be reduced to CH2I. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the double bonds. Wait, but the reagents are HI and red phosphorus, not something like H2O.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the addition of HI across the double bonds. So each double bond would add HI, becoming a diiodide. For example, the cyclohexene ring would become a cyclohexane diiodide, the vinyl group would become a CH2CH2I, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to approach this from another angle. The product after reaction is something that we need to find the IHD of. So, perhaps the reaction reduces some double bonds, thereby lowering the IHD.

Let me consider the possible reaction steps:

1. Reduction of the cyclohexene's double bond. If the ring's double bond is reduced, the ring becomes cyclohexane, which is a single ring (no double bond). That would decrease the IHD by 1.

2. Reduction of the vinyl group's double bond. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would become CH2CH2, but that's not possible. Wait, no: the vinyl group is attached at position 5, so the structure is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Reducing that would make it a single bond, so the substituent becomes -CH2CH2- but that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH2, but as a substituent, it's -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-. So when attached to the ring, it's at position 5: so the substituent is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the group is CH2=CH- attached to position 5 of the cyclohexene.

If that double bond is reduced, it becomes CH2CH2, but that's actually a single bond. So the vinyl group becomes CH2CH2, but that would make it a single bond. So the substituent becomes a CH2CH2 group, but that's a single bond. So its IHD contribution would decrease by 1.

3. The formyl group is a carbonyl (CHO), which is a double bond. If that is reduced, perhaps to CH2OH, that would also decrease the IHD by 1.

So, starting with 3 double bonds (cyclohexene, vinyl, and formyl), each reduction would lower the IHD by 1 each, leading to a total of 0 IHD remaining. But wait, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring, which is a ring (counts as one IHD) plus a double bond (counts as another), so the cyclohexene contributes two IHD. Then the vinyl group adds another IHD, and the formyl group another, so total IHD is 2 (from the ring and its double bond) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) =4? Wait, no, because the cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, so that's two IHD. Then the vinyl group's double bond adds another, and the formyl group's another, making 2 +1 +1 =4 IHD in the starting material.

Wait, no, the formula is IHD = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So perhaps I should calculate the IHD directly.

But perhaps I should instead think about the product's structure and then compute its IHD.

So, let me try to figure out what the product looks like.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Reaction conditions: red phosphorus and excess HI.

I think that the reaction conditions are for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but no, that uses ketones and an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups to alkanes. For example, in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but perhaps under certain conditions, they can be further reduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction cleaves the carbonyl group. Wait, another reaction I heard about is the hydrolysis of nitriles with red phosphorus and HI, but the starting material doesn't have nitriles.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is deoxygenation of the formyl group. For example, converting the formyl (CHO) into CH2 group.

Wait, I've read somewhere that when an aldehyde is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it gets converted into an alkane. So the CHO group becomes CH2. Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond would be hydrogenated to a single bond, and the cyclohexene's double bond would be hydrogenated as well.

If that's the case, then the product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane (no double bond, but it's a six-membered ring, which counts as one IHD).

Wait, no. Because the cyclohexene was a ring with one double bond, so IHD of 2. After hydrogenation, the ring remains (so IHD 1 for the ring) and the double bond is gone (so that's a decrease of 1). So for the ring, IHD goes from 2 to 1.

Wait, no. The IHD of the ring alone is 1 (since a six-membered ring without a double bond would have an IHD of 1). But the starting material's cyclohexene had a ring (1) and a double bond (1), so IHD of 2 for that part.

So, if the cyclohexene's double bond is hydrogenated, the ring remains (IHD 1), and the double bond is gone, so the IHD for the ring part goes from 2 to 1.

Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated, so that's another IHD decrease by 1.

The formyl group's carbonyl (CHO) is reduced to CH2, so that's another IHD decrease by 1.

So, the starting material had IHD of 4 (ring: 2, vinyl:1, formyl:1). After reaction, the ring has IHD 1 (since it's a cyclohexane), vinyl group is single bond (IHD 0), and formyl group is CH2 (IHD 0). So the total IHD would be 1.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexane ring (IHD 1), plus no other double bonds or rings. So the IHD would be 1.

Wait, but wait. The product would have the cyclohexane ring (IHD 1), and any other double bonds or rings would be considered. But if all the other double bonds are gone, then the IHD would be 1.

But wait, perhaps the reaction opens the ring? Because when HI adds to a cyclohexene ring, under certain conditions, it might open the ring. Let me think—could the cyclohexene ring undergo ring-opening addition with HI?

In the presence of HI, cyclohexene would typically add HI across the double bond, forming a diiodide. Wait, but if the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the addition is more of a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a complete hydrogenation of all double bonds. So the product would have a cyclohexane ring (IHD 1), no vinyl group (so it's a CH2 group), and the formyl group is now a CH2 group. So the product would have structure: cyclohexane with a carboxylic acid at position 1, a CH2 group at position 2, and a CH2 group at position 5 (from the vinyl group being hydrogenated to CH2).

Wait, but the formyl group is CHO; if it's reduced to CH2, then the structure becomes CH2 at C2. And the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2CH2 (but that's a single bond, so the substituent is CH2CH2, which is actually a single bond. So the substituent becomes a CH2CH2 group, which is a single bond, so no IHD from that.

So the product's structure is cyclohexane (which has one ring, IHD 1), and the substituents are CH2, CH2, and the carboxylic acid group.

So the IHD of the product is 1, because the only ring is the cyclohexane.

So the answer would be A) 1.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Alternatively, could the reaction lead to ring opening? For example, if the cyclohexene ring opens up, the product would be an open-chain compound. If that happens, the ring would no longer contribute to the IHD. But I'm not sure. Let's consider that possibility.

If the cyclohexene ring is opened, the product would be an open chain with no rings, so the IHD would come from any remaining double bonds.

So, if the reaction opens the ring, and the other double bonds (vinyl and formyl) are reduced, then the product would have no rings and no double bonds. So IHD would be zero.

But I'm not certain whether the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) would open the ring. Usually, ring-opening reactions require specific conditions, like strong acids or bases, or specific reagents. I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that.

In the absence of specific knowledge about ring-opening under these conditions, I think it's more likely that the double bonds are hydrogenated without opening the ring. So the product has a cyclohexane ring (IHD 1) and no double bonds, leading to an IHD of 1.

So, the correct answer would be A) 1.


The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{IHD} = \frac{2C + 2 - H - X + N}{2}
\]

where \(C\) is the number of carbons, \(H\) the hydrogens, \(X\) the halogens, and \(N\) the nitrogens. For the given molecule, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. This molecule contains:

1. A cyclohexene ring (a six-membered ring with one double bond, contributing 2 IHD: 1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
2. A vinyl group (-CH\(_2\)=CH\(_2\)) at position 5, contributing 1 IHD (from the double bond).
3. A formyl group (CHO) at position 2, contributing 1 IHD (from the carbonyl double bond).

Thus, the starting material has a total IHD of 4.

When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations occur:

1. **Reduction of the cyclohexene double bond**: The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring into cyclohexane. The ring itself contributes 1 IHD (as it remains intact).
2. **Reduction of the vinyl group**: The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond, eliminating its contribution to the IHD.
3. **Reduction of the formyl group**: The carbonyl double bond in the formyl group is reduced, converting the CHO group into a CH\(_2\) group, thus eliminating its contribution to the IHD.

After the reaction, the product is a cyclohexane ring with no double bonds and no halogens or nitrogens. The only contribution to the IHD comes from the cyclohexane ring, which has an IHD of 1.

Thus, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

Answer: A
