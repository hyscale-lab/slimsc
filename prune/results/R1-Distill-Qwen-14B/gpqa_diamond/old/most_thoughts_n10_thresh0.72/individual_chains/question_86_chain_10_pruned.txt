Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The starting materials are compounds A and B, each treated with a different reducing agent. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. We need to find out which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm. So I think this might be about the reduction of ketones or maybe some kind of cyclic ketone formation. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right? So tetrahydro-pyran would be the fully saturated formâ€”like a cyclic ether, but in this case, it's a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which has a ketone group.

So the product is a cyclic ketone. How do you form a cyclic ketone from a starting material? Oh wait, maybe this is an example of a reduction of a carbonyl group, but wait, no, LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents. They typically reduce carbonyls to alcohols. Wait, but the product here is a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Unless the starting material is an ester or maybe a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. That could be formed from the reduction of a cyclic ester, perhaps. Because when you reduce a lactone, you get a diol, but that doesn't directly make a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. Or perhaps it's an aldol reaction product.

Wait, another approach: LiBH4 and BH3 are both borohydride reducing agents. LiBH4 is a stronger
