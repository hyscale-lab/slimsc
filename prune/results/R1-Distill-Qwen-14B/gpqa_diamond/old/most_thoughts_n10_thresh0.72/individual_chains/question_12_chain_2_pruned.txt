Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum of the products must balance out because of conservation laws.

The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have almost zero mass, right? So maybe I can treat the neutrino as massless for this problem. That should simplify things.

So, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest energy, which would be m_pi * c^2. Since we're using MeV, I can just take that as 139.6 MeV.

In the decay products, we have the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So the muon must carry some kinetic energy, and the neutrino will carry away the remaining energy, but because it's massless, its energy is all kinetic.

Let me recall the conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Similarly, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum would be -p to ensure the total momentum is zero.

The energy of the muon will be the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. Let's write that as E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, no, the units are in MeV, so maybe I can just write the expressions without c terms. Oh right, in particle physics, energy is often in MeV, and mass is in MeV/c². So when we calculate E = sqrt( p²c^2 + m²c^4 ), it's better to express everything in terms that work with the units. Alternatively, perhaps using natural units where c=1, so E = sqrt(p² + m²).

So the pion is at rest, so pion's energy is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the muon's energy will be E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) and the neutrino's energy E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + 0 ) = p, since its mass is zero.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

This should equal the pion's energy: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Wait, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, and m_mu is 105.7. So the equation is sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, to solve for p, I can rearrange this equation. Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + 105.7² = (139.6 -
