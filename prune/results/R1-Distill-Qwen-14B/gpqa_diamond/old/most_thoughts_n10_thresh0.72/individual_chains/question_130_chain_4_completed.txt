Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about redshift and detecting objects using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The objects in question are large clouds of neutral hydrogen that absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is a specific wavelength in hydrogen. But here, it's talking about absorption, so maybe it's the Lyman-alpha forest in quasar spectra. That's when intervening hydrogen clouds at high redshifts absorb the quasar's light, creating absorption lines at the Lyman-alpha wavelength.

So, the key here is that the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 Angstrom) is in the ultraviolet range. But optical ground-based telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So, how does this affect the redshift?

If the hydrogen cloud is at a certain redshift, the absorbed wavelength would be longer—redshifted. For an optical telescope to detect it, the redshifted wavelength must be in the optical range. 

Wait, what's the optical range? I think it's about 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. But the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. So, the observed wavelength lambda_obs = (1 + z) * lambda_rest.

We need lambda_obs to be less than or equal to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms) to be in the optical. So, (1 + z) * 1216 <= 7000.

Let me compute that. So, (1 + z) = 7000 / 1216. Let me calculate that. 7000 divided by 1216 is approximately... 5.756.

Wait, 1216 * 5 is 6080. 7000-6080=920. 1216*0.75 is 912, which is close to 920. So 5.75 gives 1216*(5.75)= about 7000. So 1 + z ≈5.75. So z ≈4.75.

Wait, but that would make the redshift around 4.75. But looking at the options, the highest is 3 and 2.4. Hmm, none of the options are that high. So maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait a second. Wait, maybe the quasar's emission is in the optical, but the absorption is in the UV. But the ground-based telescopes can't see the UV, so the quasar's light that reaches us in the optical would have had the Lyman-alpha absorption shifted into the optical.

Wait, the quasar's light is coming through intergalactic medium. So if the hydrogen is at redshift z, then the Lyman-alpha absorption line would be at (1+z)*1216 A. But if (1+z)*1216 is in the optical, then the observed wavelength would be visible. Because if it's in the optical, ground-based telescopes can see it.

Wait, but if the absorbed wavelength is in the optical, then the quasar's light, which originally emits the Lyman-alpha at 1216, would have that line shifted. So, for the absorption line to be in the optical, (1+z)*1216 <= 7000 Angstroms.

So, same calculation as before. So z would be about 4.75. But none of the options are that high. So this can't be right. Maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, the question is about the lower limit. Maybe I need to think about the minimum redshift where the Lyman-alpha would still be in the optical. So the maximum redshift possible would bring the wavelength to 7000 Angstroms. Wait, but the lower limit is the smallest z for which the Lyman-alpha is still visible. So if the Lyman-alpha is observed in the optical, the redshift must be such that the observed wavelength is >= the start of the optical range.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the higher the redshift, the further into the optical the wavelength shifts. So if the observed wavelength is in the optical, then the redshift must be high enough that (1+z)*1216 >= optical lower limit (say 4000 Angstroms, which is 400 nm). Wait, no, optical is from around 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So the Lyman-alpha must be in that range.

Wait, but the Lyman-alpha is at 1216 Angstroms. So if the observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216. For it to be in the optical, (1+z)*1216 >= 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), and <=7000 Angstroms.

So the lower limit on (1+z)*1216 is 4000, and the upper limit is 7000.

So, to find the lower limit on z, we set (1 + z) * 1216 = 4000 Angstroms.

Calculating that: 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29.

So the lower limit on z is approximately 2.29. So any z above that would have the Lyman-alpha line in the optical, which can be observed by ground-based telescopes.

Looking at the options, the choices are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 2.4 is option C. So the lower limit is around 2.29, so the minimum redshift would be just above 2.29. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3. The options don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.3. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so any z above that would be detectable. So the minimum z is around 2.3, so any object with z higher than that can be detected.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimum z is about 2.3. So if the options include 2.4, which is higher than 2.3, then 2.4 would be the lower limit. Because anything below 2.3 would have the Lyman-alpha line in the UV, which we can't see. So the lower limit is 2.3, so the answer is the smallest z that ensures the line is in the optical.

Wait, but the question says "lower limit on the redshift", so the minimum z where detection is possible. So, the redshift must be greater than or equal to 2.3. So, the lower limit is 2.3. So among the options, the closest higher value is 2.4 (option C). Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the smallest z that allows the line to be in the optical, which is z= (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.29, so the lower limit is about 2.3. So the answer would require z >= approx 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.3. So the correct answer would be the smallest option that is above 2.3. So if the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9, then C)2.4 is the correct choice.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the quasars themselves are at higher redshifts, and the hydrogen clouds are at even higher redshifts. So the Lyman-alpha absorption would be at longer wavelengths. So for the Lyman-alpha line to be observed in the optical, the redshift of the hydrogen cloud must be such that (1+z) *1216 <= 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that when (1+z)*1216=7000, z is about 4.75. That's the maximum redshift where Lyman-alpha is still in the optical. The minimum redshift would be when (1+z)*1216 >= 4000, which gives z=2.29.

So the range of z is from about 2.29 to 4.75. So the lower limit is 2.29. So any cloud at z >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical.

So the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) such that they can be detected. So the minimum z is 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest value is C)2.4. So option C is the correct answer.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption (rest wavelength ~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the redshifted wavelength falls within the optical range (approximately 4000–7000 Å). 

The observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + z) \cdot \lambda_{\text{rest}}
\]

For the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable in the optical, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
4000 \, \text{Å} \leq (1 + z) \cdot 1216 \, \text{Å} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å}
\]

To find the lower limit on \( z \), we set \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest value greater than \( 2.29 \) is \( z = 2.4 \). Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for detecting these clouds with optical ground-based telescopes is \( z \approx 2.4 \).
