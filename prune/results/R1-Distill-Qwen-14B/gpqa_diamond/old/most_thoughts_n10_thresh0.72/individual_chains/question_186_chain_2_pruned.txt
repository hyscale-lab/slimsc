Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It usually involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another 1,5-diene. But wait, let me think more carefully.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I'm supposed to figure out the product after it undergoes Cope rearrangement. Let me try to draw the structure of this compound first.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three rings: two bridgehead carbons. The numbering is such that the bridgehead positions are 1, 4, and 5. Wait, no, the bicyclo system is 2.2.1, so the bridgeheads are at positions 1, 4, and another. Let me sketch it out. Okay, the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a double bond between carbons 5 and 6, I think. The 2-vinyl group is attached to the 2-position, which is one of the bridge carbons.

Wait, the structure is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, so the nitrogen is at position 2 because of the 'aza' part. So position 2 is where the ring has a nitrogen, and there's a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached also at position 2. The double bond in the bicyclo system is at position 5, so between 5 and 6.

So, the structure is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond at 5-6, a nitrogen at 2, and a vinyl group also at 2. So, the molecule has a conjugated diene maybe? Because the double bond from the vinyl and the bridge double bond might be conjugated.

Wait, but wait. The vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached to the bridge. So the bridgehead carbon (position 2) has a vinyl group and a nitrogen. So, the structure is something like:

- The bicyclo has bridges between 1-4, 4-7 (or another numbering; perhaps I should get the exact structure). Alternatively, maybe position 2 is connected to the nitrogen and the vinyl.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So, in this case, the compound is 2-vinyl-2-azanorbornene (since it's hept-5-ene, not 2-ene). So the double bond is between 5 and 6, not 2 and 3.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me try to number the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. The numbering starts at one bridgehead, then goes around. So, positions 1, 2,
