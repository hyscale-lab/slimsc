Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants have to do with how stable a complex is, right? The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D. So, let me think about what I need to do.

The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because they're not in order. Oh wait, probably β1 corresponds to the first complex, like [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is the second, and so on.

But I'm a bit rusty on the exact notation. Let me recall: The general form is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), since each SCN- is -1. So for n=1, charge is [Co(SCN)]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)₂]^0; n=3, [Co(SCN)₃]^-; and n=4, [Co(SCN)₄]^2-.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato" which means two SCN ligands. So the blue complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which is the second complex. So we're looking for the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

Stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that doesn't make sense because β3 is bigger than β2, but β4 is smaller. That might mean that their order is not simply increasing with n. So the stability constants are for each step.

Wait, no, stability constants (formation constants) are for the stepwise addition. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex: Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ ; β1=9.

Then β2 is the formation constant for adding another SCN: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]^0 ; β2=40.

Similarly, β3 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]^- ; β3=63.

And β4 is for [Co(SCN)3]^- + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^2- ; β4=16.

Wait, that seems a bit odd because β4 is lower than β3. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Maybe the β values are cumulative? Or perhaps they are for each step, but in that case, the order would matter because each step builds on the previous.

Wait no, in stability constants, each β is for the nth step. So the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is the
