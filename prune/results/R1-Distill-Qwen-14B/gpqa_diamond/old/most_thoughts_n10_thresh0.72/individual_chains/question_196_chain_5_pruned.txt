Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. And the speed of light is c. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a non-relativistic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². That equals the kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv_max². So solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But this is a relativistic case, so I can't use the classical formulas directly.

Relativistically, energy considerations change. The total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, the oscillator's energy is quantized in quantum mechanics, but here it's not clear if we're considering it classically. Hmm, maybe I should treat this classically, but include the relativistic corrections.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't the same as in Newtonian mechanics. The total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1)mc².

But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the relativistic expression for momentum. In the non-relativistic case, the oscillator's maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But relativistically, the relation between momentum and velocity is different.

But wait, the problem says it's a relativistic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. So perhaps we can model it similarly to the classical case, but with relativistic momentum.

Wait, the potential energy of a
