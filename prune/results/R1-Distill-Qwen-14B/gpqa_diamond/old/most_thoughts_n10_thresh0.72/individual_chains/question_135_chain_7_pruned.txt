Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let's think it through step by step.

So, the problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh, right, probably this is a Yukawa-like interaction. The boson X is interacting with fermions, mediated by the coupling term. The fermions are represented by ψ_f, and λ is the coupling constant. The term (υ + X) suggests that υ is the vacuum expectation value (VEV), which is typical in the Higgs mechanism, but not sure if that's directly relevant here.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses.

Kinematically allowed means that the decay products need to have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X. So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion must have a mass less than half of X's mass. Because when the fermions are produced, their rest masses contribute to the energy required. So the maximum individual fermion mass would be 3 GeV because 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV.

Now, let's list all the possible quarks and leptons and their masses. I remember the approximate masses of the known particles:

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2-5 MeV (so ~0.002-0.005 GeV)
- Down (d): similar to up, say about 3-6 MeV (0.003-0.006 GeV)
- Strange (s): around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): around 4.5-5 GeV
- Top (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, negligible mass (but for this problem, maybe we can ignore them as they're not in the options)

So, for X (6 GeV) to decay into fermions f and f̄, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But since each fermion's mass is m, the pair would require 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermions:

Which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

- Quarks: u, d, s, c. Because u and d are very light, s is about 0.1 GeV, c is 1.5 GeV. All are under 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because each would require 4.5 GeV, and two of them would be 9 GeV, way above X's 6 GeV. So the decay into b b̄ isn't allowed.

Similarly, the top quark is way too heavy, but since t is 173 GeV, it's way beyond any consideration here.

Leptons: e, μ, τ. e is 0.0005 GeV, μ is ~0.1 GeV, τ is ~1.777 GeV. All are under 3 GeV except for τ, which is just under 1.8 GeV. So all leptons are allowed.

Wait, but wait a moment. The tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 2mτ is ~3.554 GeV. Wait, 1.777 * 2 is 3.554, which is more than 3 GeV. So the mass of tau is around 1.777 GeV, so 2mτ is about 3.554 GeV. Oh wait, but X has a mass of 6 GeV, which is more than 3.554 GeV. Because 6 GeV is way bigger than 3.554 GeV
