Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form a butanoic acid derivative. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations for A and B.

Okay, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I'm thinking that when a ketone reacts with CN-, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically don't react with HCN or CN- under normal conditions. Oh wait, but maybe under specific conditions, like in the presence of a strong acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a case of cyanide acting as a nucleophile in a ketone. So, the ketone would undergo a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones are usually not that reactive towards nucleophilic attack unless something else is happening, like maybe the formation of an enolate or some kind of acid catalysis.

Wait, maybe this is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yes, I remember that ketones can react with HCN (or CN-) to form cyanohydrins. The reaction is typically acid-catalyzed. So the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then, CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and then the proton is transferred elsewhere, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The molecule has a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that's next to a hydroxyl group (OH). The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait: the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. When the cyanide adds, the product would have the CN and OH groups both attached to the same carbon
