Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Wait, what's metathesis again? Oh right, it's a reaction where the catalyst breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds, effectively redistributing the substituents between the alkenes.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, since the molecule has a double bond, does it have any stereogenic centers? Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. Wait, is that correct? Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with the double bond starting at carbon 1. So carbon 2 is next to the double bond. Wait, 3-methyl would be on carbon 3, which is the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon

Okay, so I have this question in front of me about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallics, but I'll try to think it through. 

Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions, right? So that's breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. The starting material here is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, so the molecule has a chiral center.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons, and the double bond starts at carbon 1. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. Let's see: the structure is actually CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the full structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)- something else? Wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. Pentene has five carbons. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that's 1-pentene. But we have a 3-methyl substituent. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, no. Wait, 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait, that would make it six carbons. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm counting wrong. Let's think again.

Pent-1-ene: positions are 1,2,3
