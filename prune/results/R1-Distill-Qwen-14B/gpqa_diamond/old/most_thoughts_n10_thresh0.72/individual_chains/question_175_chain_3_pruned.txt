Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm. Let's try to break it down.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, I imagine it's like an ellipsoid, maybe elongated along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates energy at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis.

The maximum power is given as A, and we're asked to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f as a function of λ.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each has two parts: the fraction and the λ dependence.

First, I need to recall how the radiation pattern from a dipole or similar oscillating charge looks. Wait, a spheroid is similar to a dipole in shape, maybe? I remember that a dipole's radiation pattern is directional. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) varies with the angle θ.

For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone) is given by the dipole formula. The intensity (I think) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Because the dipole's radiation is maximum at θ=90 degrees and minimum at θ=0 and 180 degrees.

Wait, or is it (sinθ)^2? I think that's right. Because the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So at θ=90 degrees, sinθ is 1, so maximum intensity. At θ=0, sinθ is 0, so zero intensity.

So if the maximum power is A, then the total power is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. Let me think about that. The total power P is the integral of f(θ) over 4π steradians. Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. So ∫ f(θ) dΩ = A, but wait, no. Wait, the maximum power A is the maximum value of f(θ), perhaps? Or is A the total power?

Wait, the question says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So A is the maximum value of f(θ). So at θ=90 degrees, f(θ) = A.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the function f is the radiated power per unit solid angle. So the maximum value of f is A. So the total power would be the integral of f(θ) over all angles. Because power is the integral of intensity over solid angle.

But wait, the question isn't asking about the total power, it's asking about the fraction of A radiated at a specific angle. So if the maximum is A, then at θ=30 degrees, what's f(θ) as a fraction of A?

So f(θ) = A * (something with θ). According to the dipole radiation pattern, f(θ) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So f(θ) = A * (sinθ)^2 / (sin90)^2.
