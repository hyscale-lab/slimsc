Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen detected using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that these clouds absorb light from background quasars, and they're called Lyman-alpha absorbers or something like that.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is given as ~1216 Angstroms. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha transition is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. So when neutral hydrogen is present, it absorbs light at this wavelength. But when the background quasar's light passes through a cloud of this hydrogen, the absorption line is observed at a different wavelength because of redshift.

So the key here is that the hydrogen is neutral, which implies it's in the intergalactic medium, maybe part of the Lyman-alpha forest. And the question is about the redshift where these clouds can be detected with optical telescopes. So I guess I need to figure out the redshift where the absorbed wavelength moves into the optical range, which is what ground-based telescopes can observe.

Optical telescopes typically observe in the range of about 400-700 nm, I think. Wait, but the Lyman-alpha wavelength is in the ultraviolet. So when the quasar's light is emitted, the Lyman-alpha is at 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm). If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_rest * (1 + z). 

So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, λ_obs has to be at least around 400 nm or more? Or wait, no, wait. Because when the quasar's light is observed, the Lyman-alpha absorption would have redshifted. So if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's absorption would be at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms.

Wait no, the cloud is between us and the quasar, so the quasar's light passes through the cloud, which has a lower redshift than the quasar. So if the quasar has redshift z, the cloud's redshift would be less than that. But I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The problem is to find
