Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that this model considers both the rotation and vibration of a diatomic molecule. The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about whether this transition involves a change in rotation, vibration, or both. Because the non-rigid rotor model includes both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy states are purely rotational, but since this is the non-rigid rotor, I think it also includes vibrational energy. So the total energy is a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not entirely sure how that works. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor treats the bond as having some flexibility, so both rotational and vibrational energies are considered.

The molecule is currently in the fundamental state. What's that state look like? I think the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state of vibration, which is n=0. And for rotation, the ground state is the lowest rotational level, which is J=0. Because in quantum mechanics, the rotational state is characterized by the quantum number J, which is a non-negative integer. So the fundamental state is probably (J=0, n=0).

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest state. So what's the next state after (0,0)? Well, the next possible state could either be increasing J by 1 (so J=1, n=0) or increasing n by 1 (so J=0, n=1). But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

I remember that vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. And rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So the total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib.

Wait, but the molecule is in (J=0, n=0), which is the fundamental state.
