Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Hmm, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right?

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each σ_i is a Pauli matrix corresponding to the x, y, or z direction. So the dot product σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

The Hamiltonian H is then ε times that sum. Now, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way since Pauli matrices have known properties.

I recall that for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because each Pauli matrix squares to the identity matrix, and when you take the trace, each has trace 0. So for σ · n, the eigenvalues should be +1 and -1. Let me think: when you have a spin-½ system, the spin component in a direction has possible values ±ħ/2. But wait, in the Hamiltonian, is that factor involved here?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. So if H is ε times σ · n, then the eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by those eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues would be ε * 1 and ε * (-1), which are ±ε.

Wait a minute, but sometimes when dealing with spin, the spin matrices have factors of ħ. Oh wait, in the Pauli matrices, sometimes they're written with a factor of ħ/2. Let me think: the standard spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ. So in that case, the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as ε σ · n. So the σ here is the Pauli matrices without any ħ factor. So their eigenvalues are ±1, so multiplied by ε gives ±ε.

So looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. Option C is plus and minus (ε hbar/2), which would be the case if the Pauli matrices were scaled with ħ/2. But in the given H, it's ε times the σ matrices as they are. So the eigenvalues should be ±ε.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by analyzing the properties of the Pauli matrices.

The Pauli matrices (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)) are 2x2 matrices with eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). For a general direction \( \vec{n} \), the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \( \vec{n} \). Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) remain \( \pm 1 \). Multiplying by the constant \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) corresponds to the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), but not the scaled Hamiltonian \( H \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) correctly represents the eigenvalues of \( H \), as the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) would apply if the Pauli matrices were scaled by \( \hbar/2 \), but the problem does not include such a factor.
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) corresponds to the eigenvalues of the spin operator \( \vec{S} = (\hbar/2) \vec{\sigma} \), not the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Answer: B
