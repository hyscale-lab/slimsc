Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA in a sample. The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copies. He ran serially diluted samples, each with three technical replicates. The efficiency was 100%, which is perfect, and R² was 1, so the data should fit the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3.

Wait, the options are about why the results might have discrepancies. Let me look at his data. The Ct values for each concentration are pretty close. For 100,000 copies, the Ct is around 34. Then 10,000 is about 30.6, 30.9. 1000 copies give 27.3, and so on. Each concentration's Ct is about 3-3.3 cycles lower than the previous, which makes sense because each ten-fold dilution would lower the Ct by about 3.3 cycles if the efficiency is 100% (since the formula is slope = -log10(efficiency), I think, so with efficiency 100%, which is 1, log10(1) is 0. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Oh right, the efficiency is calculated as 10^(-1/slope). So a slope of -3.3 would mean efficiency is 10^(-1/-3.3) ≈ 10^0.303 ≈ about 2, which is 100% efficiency. Oh wait, no, 100% efficiency is when each cycle doubles the DNA perfectly, so the calculation from the slope would be correct.

But wait, the question is about the discrepancies in the results. Looking at the Ct values: each concentration's Ct is about 3.3 cycles lower than the next higher concentration. For example, 100,000 is 33.9, 10,000 is 30.6, which is a difference of about 3.3 cycles. Similarly, 10,000 to 1000 is 30.6 to 27.3, again about 3.3. So
