Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me read it again.

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, which is represented as Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two energies, presumably the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm. So I think this is a problem about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite to each other to conserve momentum.

Wait, right. So let me outline what I know:

- The pion is initially at rest, so its momentum is zero.
- After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, the neutrino is a lepton, and its rest mass is negligible. So its energy is approximately equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles). 

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, but the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be more than that. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just kinetic plus any rest mass, which is almost nothing.

So let me write down the conservation equations.

Conservation of energy:
E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino

Conservation of momentum:
p_muon = -p_neutrino

Since the neutrino is massless, E_neutrino = p_neutrino * c. Similarly, the muon's energy is E_muon = sqrt( (p_muon c)^2 + (m_muon c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, maybe I should use units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So E for the muon is sqrt(p_muon^2 + m_muon^2), and E for the neutrino is p_neutrino (since m=0).

But since p_muon = p_neutrino (in magnitude but opposite in direction), let me denote p_muon as p, and p_neutrino as p as well (but opposite direction).

So E_muon = sqrt(p^2 + m_muon^2) 
E_neutrino = p 

So total energy after decay is sqrt(p
