Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the structure. So the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Wait, wait. Let me clarify the numbering. Oh wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So in the ring, substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. That makes it a meta arrangement for the nitro and ethoxy, but wait, actually, if they are adjacent, that's a para arrangement? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So let me imagine the positions.

Let's imagine the benzene ring with positions 1, 2, 3. So 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are adjacent to each other in a row: ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So it's a trisubstituted benzene with substituents in adjacent positions. So the nitro and ethoxy are next to each other. Hmm.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. I need to figure out which sequence will correctly add these substituents in the right order to get the correct positions.

I remember that when adding substituents to benzene, the order of addition is crucial because each substitution affects the orientation of the next. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups present on the ring. 

So, the substituents can be added in any order, but the directing effects will determine where each new group attaches. For example, activating groups like -OEt (ethoxy) are strong activating, meta directors. Deactivating groups like nitro are meta directors as well, but deactivating. The tert-butyl group is an alkyl group, which is activating and ortho/para director.

Wait, but wait, substituents can influence each other. So, the order of addition matters a lot. Let me think about each substituent:

1. Ethoxy group (-OEt): This is a strong activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

2. tert-Butyl group (-C(CH2)3): Another activating group (since it's an alkyl), also an ortho/para director.

3. Nitro group (-NO2): Strongly deactivating, meta director.

So, the challenge is to add these three groups in such a way that each step correctly positions the next substituent.

Let me plan the synthesis steps.

I think the key is to add the groups in an order that allows each subsequent substitution to be correctly directed. Let me consider possible orders:

Option 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, ethoxy is a strong activating group. If I add it first, the next substitution (tert-butyl) would occur at ortho or para to the ethoxy. But then, when adding nitro, which is a deactivating group, where would it go?

Alternatively, adding nitro first: Nitro is a meta director. If I add nitro first, the next group would have to go meta to it. But then adding ethoxy, which is activating, might interfere with the nitro's directing effect.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the tert-butyl first. Then, ethoxy next, followed by nitro.

Wait, let me think.

Let me
