Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

Wait, the problem gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond, right? So for carbon, it's 1000 kJ/mol. That's the energy needed to break a C-C bond into two C atoms or something like that.

The question is about enthalpy of formation. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the enthalpy of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But I remember that bond energies are used to calculate the enthalpy change of reactions based on bond breaking and forming. So maybe I need to use bond energies to compute the formation enthalpy of this molecule.

Wait, but the options are given, and they are A) 11200 kJ/mol, B) 67.4 kJ/mol, C) 11.44 kJ/g, D)1900 kJ/g. Oh, but wait, the units are a mix of per mole and per gram. So I need to be careful with that.

Wait, the given data is in kJ/mol
