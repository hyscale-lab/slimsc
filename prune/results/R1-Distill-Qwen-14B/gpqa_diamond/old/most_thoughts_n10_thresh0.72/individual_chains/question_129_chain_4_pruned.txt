Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find out which compound E is in the given reaction scheme. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Okay, the problem states that Compound A reacts with HCN to produce B. Then B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. C reacts with HNO2 to give D, and finally, D loses an inert gas to form E. The options are four different ketones, so E must be a ketone.

Looking at the hints, the first one says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are usually used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction typically converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So, the ylide would attack the carbonyl group of A, forming an alkene. The product is a cyclopentane with substituents.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure. The cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. The 4-position has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)2- group attached as a substituent but in a ylid form, maybe as a double bond. So propan-2-ylidene would be like (CH3)2C=, right?

But wait, in the Wittig reaction, the ylide (like Ph3P=CH-) attacks the carbonyl, forming a double bond. So if the product has a substituted cyclopentane with a substituent that's an allyl group (maybe), then the starting material A must have a carbonyl group in a position that, upon reaction with the ylide, forms that structure.

So perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents. Let me think. If the Wittig reaction forms the double bond, then the carbonyl in compound A would have been where the double bond is now. So the substituents on the cyclopentane come from where the carbonyl was.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents are methyl at 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at 4. The propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2C(CH3)2 group attached as a double bond. So maybe in compound A, the carbonyl was at position 4, and the ylide added to form the double bond between positions 4 and maybe another position?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound A is 4-methylcyclopentanone. Then the Wittig would add a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the structure of the ylide. Another way: when a Wittig reacts with a ketone, it forms an alkene.

So if compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, the Wittig would add a group to form an alkene.

Wait, maybe the product has a substituent that's part of the ring. Let me try to imagine the structure. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 4. The propan-2-ylidene is at 4, which would have the structure as a CH2 group attached to a C(CH3)2. So the ylide would have been something like (CH3)2C-CH2-PPh3? Or maybe the ylide is (CH3)2C-PPh3+, which reacts with the carbonyl.

Wait, the ylide structure is typically PR3+=CH-. So if the ylide is (CH2
