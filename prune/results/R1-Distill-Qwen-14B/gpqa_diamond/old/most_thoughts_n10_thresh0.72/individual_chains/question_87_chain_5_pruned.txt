Okay, so I've got this problem here about an aromatic compound and its NMR spectrum. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so if it's di-substituted, that means two substituents attached. So the substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, 6-membered ring with 8 carbons total. So substituents add 2 more carbons. So each substituent must add one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none, but that doesn't make sense because it's di-substituted. So each substituent has one carbon.

Wait, but the substituents can't be just a single carbon, because that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or something, which would have a carbonyl (C=O), which is a functional group. Oh, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen, probably.

Wait, so the substituents on the benzene ring are -X (like Cl or Br) and a carbonyl group. But wait, the carbonyl group could be part of a larger substituent. Let me think. For example, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached as an acetyl group, like OAc (but that's an ester) or maybe a ketone, RCO-.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, the substituents could be like a carbonyl group as a ketone (like acetophenone: Ph-CO-CH3), but that would add two substituents? No, wait, acetophenone has one substituent: the acetyl group (COCH3) attached to the benzene. Wait, but the question says di-substituted, so two substituents.

So two substituents on
