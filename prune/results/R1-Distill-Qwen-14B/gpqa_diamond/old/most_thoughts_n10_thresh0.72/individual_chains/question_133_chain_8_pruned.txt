Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, and it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Hmm, right. So orthophosphate ions are HPO4^2-, I think. Wait, no, wait. Wait, phosphoric acid (H3PO4) dissociates in steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate is actually HPO4^2-, right? Or wait, maybe sometimes people refer to different species as ortho, meta, etc. Oh wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. 

Wait, no. I think orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, but in solution, it can lose H+ ions. So in solution, the different species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? Or is it PO4^3-? I might be mixing up terms here. Alternatively, sometimes orthophosphate is considered as PO4^3- because that's the completely deprotonated form.

Wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions, so maybe it's PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? Hmm. I think I need to clarify that. But perhaps the problem is just referring to the
