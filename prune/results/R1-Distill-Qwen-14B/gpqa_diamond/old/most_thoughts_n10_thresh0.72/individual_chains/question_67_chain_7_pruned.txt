Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it step by step. 

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Each electron is in a p orbital, right? So for each, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1 because p orbitals have l=1. But wait, the problem is about their coupled angular momentum state. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, okay, so l1 and l2 are both 1, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1. 

Wait, so the system's total angular momentum is 2? But each electron has l=1. Oh, right, when you couple two angular momenta, you add them. So the possible total L can be l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. Since l1 and l2 are both 1, the total L can be 2, 1, or 0. Oh, wait, but in the given state, the total L is 2. So we're in the maximum possible state for this system.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring L1z and L2z, both giving -ħ. Let me think: L1z is the z-component of the first electron's orbital angular momentum, and L2z for the second. So each can be measured, and we want the probability that both are -ħ.

But wait, the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. So how does that translate to the individual m1 and m2 values? Because the state is a combination of the individual states. Oh, right, the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is a combination of the product states |m1> |m2> such that m1 + m2 = M.

In this case, M is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. The possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to -1 would be (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1), (1, -2), etc., but wait, each m can't be larger than l, which is 1 for each. So each m can
