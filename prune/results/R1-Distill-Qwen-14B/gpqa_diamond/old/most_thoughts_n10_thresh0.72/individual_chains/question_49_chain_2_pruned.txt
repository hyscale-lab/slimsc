Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C. Then match them with the given options A to D. Let's take each part one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A.

Wait, sigmatropic rearrangements usually involve the shift of a pi bond. Cope and Claisen are examples, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But here, the starting materials are different. I'm trying to remember if there's a specific reaction where an amine and an alcohol form something like a cyclic structure.

Oh! Maybe it's a case of a Cope rearrangement, but wait, the starting molecule is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's N-methyldimethylamine or something similar. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. Hmm, perhaps it's a Claisen-like rearrangement, but Claisen is usually for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a Conia-ene reaction or some kind of aminol rearrangement.

Wait, another thought. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on a CH2 connected to an amine. When heated with an alcohol, maybe it undergoes a rearrangement. Wait, I think that when an amino ether is heated with an alcohol, it can undergo a Claisen-like rearrangement, forming an amine ring.

Wait, the Claisen rearrangement involves an allyl vinyl ether rearranging to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. But here, the amine is involved. I think there's a rearrangement called the Cope rearrangement for amines, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a [3,3] sigmatropic shift involving the amine.

Alternatively, wait, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So the structure is N-methyl-N,N-dimethoxyamine? Or more accurately, the structure is CH
