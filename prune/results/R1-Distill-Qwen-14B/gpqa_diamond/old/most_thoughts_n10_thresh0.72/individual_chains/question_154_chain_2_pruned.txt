Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The options are four different compounds. Let's go through each piece of data one by one.

First, the mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%) and another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm. The molecular ion is the highest mass peak, so that's the molecular weight of the compound. So the molecular formula should have a molecular weight of 156. But wait, there's another peak at 158, which is 2 mass units higher. That makes me think of something like a chlorine isotope. Because chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% as Cl-35 and 25% as Cl-37. So the molecular ion would show peaks at m/z 156 and 158 if the molecule has a chlorine atom. Let me see, 156 plus 2 is 158, so that fits. So the molecular formula includes Cl.

Next, the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, the options have different functional groups. For example, benzoic acid would have a carboxylic acid group, which has an O-H stretch that's quite broad. Or maybe an alcohol or phenol. Let's keep that in mind.

There's also a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That region is typically for carbonyl groups (C=O). For example, in carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700. Maybe this is a bit higher, so maybe a ketone or aldehyde? Or perhaps an ester or something else. Wait, 1720 is a bit higher than a regular carboxylic acid. Could it be an acid chloride? Because acid chlorides have higher carbonyl stretching frequencies, around 1800â€“1850 cm^-1. Wait, no, 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid that's deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are three main signals.

First, a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's way up there. What gives a singlet around 11 ppm? Probably an aldehyde proton (-CHO), but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but if it's an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm. But in D2O, the -OH would exchange and not appear, but the problem doesn't mention any exchange conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton but in a different environment. Or perhaps it's an aromatic proton? Wait, no,
