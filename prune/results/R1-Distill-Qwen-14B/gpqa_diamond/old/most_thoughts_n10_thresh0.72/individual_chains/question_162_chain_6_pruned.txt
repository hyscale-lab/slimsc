Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric. I remember that conformal metrics have the form ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where f is some function. So in this case, f is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

The question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere is a term I've heard before. I think it's like a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like a tractricoid or something. And the metric given might be describing such a surface.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about what the metric represents. I know that in 2D, the line element can represent the geometry of a surface. So this ds² is a 2D metric, which might be embedded in 3D as a pseudosphere.

Wait, but the metric is in terms of x and y. So maybe it's a coordinate system on the pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 2D space with this metric, and we're to compute its area.

Wait, area of the pseudosphere. The pseudosphere has a specific area formula. Let me recall. A regular sphere's area is 4πr², but for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative
