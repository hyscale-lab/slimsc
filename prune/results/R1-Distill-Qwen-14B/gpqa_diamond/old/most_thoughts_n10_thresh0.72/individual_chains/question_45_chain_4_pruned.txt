Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. The options are given, but I'm supposed to figure it out step by step.

Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And they've given E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

Wait, but these are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

But wait, in a 1D box, each particle has a quantum number n and a spin state. Since they're spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states (spin up and down). So, each energy level can hold up to two fermions.

Wait, but the particles are identical fermions, so each must have a unique combination of quantum numbers. So for each n, two particles can occupy that state (since each can have different spin). So when placing particles into the well, we have to fill up each energy level with two particles each, until we've placed all four.

So let's think about the ground state. Ground state is the lowest energy, so we'll fill the lowest possible energy levels.

We have four particles. Let's see:

The first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). So two particles go here.

Then the next level, n=2, can also hold two particles. So the remaining two go there.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each level n can have two particles, so for four particles, n=1 and n=2 will each have two particles. So the first two go into n=1, the next two into n=2. That would give the ground state.

But wait, what's the order of filling? Do we fill each n level with two particles before moving to the
