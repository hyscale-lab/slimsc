Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions like gold nuclei, but in this case, it's a different nucleus.

The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons. So X must be Li-7. So the mass number A is 7. So the mass of the nucleus is important here.

The question is asking for the energy of the collider. From what I remember, in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy (K) is often calculated, but sometimes people refer to total energy which includes rest mass energy. I think in this context, the energy would be the total energy because when dealing with relativistic speeds, you need to include both kinetic and rest mass energy.

The formula I remember for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy K is E - m_0 c² = (gamma - 1) m_0 c².

So first, I need to find gamma. Since v = 0.96c, let's compute that.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28, which is exactly 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The mass of a Li-7 nucleus is the mass of 3 protons, 4 neutrons, but wait, the actual mass is more accurately given by the atomic weight in u (atomic mass units). Alternatively, I can look up the exact mass, but I don't have exact numbers here. Wait, the mass of a Li nucleus (Li-7) is about 7 atomic mass units (u), because each u is approximately the mass of a proton or neutron.

The atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy m_0 c² is 7 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6520.5 MeV, which is 6.5205 GeV.

So m_0 c² = 6.5205 GeV.

Then the total energy E is gamma times that. Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 6.5205 GeV.

Let me compute that. Let's compute 3.5714 * 6.5205. 

Calculating:

3 *6.5205 = 19.5615

0.5714 *6.5205 is approximately:

0.5 *6.5205 = 3.26025

0.0714 *6.5205 ≈ 0.465 (since 0.07 *6.5205 is 0.4564, and 0.0014 *6.5205 ≈ 0.0091, so total about 0.465)

So 3.26025 + 0.465 ≈ 3.72525.

Adding to the 19.5615: 19.5615 + 3.72525 ≈ 23.28675 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach.

3.5714 * 6.5205.

Let me compute it step by step.

3.5714 * 6 = 21.4284.

3.5714 * 0.5205 = ?

Let's compute 3.5714 * 0.5 = 1.7857.

3.5714 * 0.0205 = 0.07324.

Adding these together: 1.7857 + 0.07324 = 1.85894.

So total E is 21.4284 + 1.85894 = 23.28734 GeV.

Wait, but is that the total energy? Because the question is about the energy of the collider. I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is typically given as the kinetic energy per ion, but sometimes as the total energy. But I'm a bit confused about what the problem is asking.

Wait the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think they are asking for the kinetic energy, because in accelerators, the energy is often the kinetic energy imparted to the particle.

Wait, no, sometimes they report the total energy. I'm a little unsure. Let me think.

The problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." The energy of the collider would be the total energy each ion has, including rest mass. Because in colliders, each beam has a certain energy. So probably, E = gamma * m c².

But I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the options. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

From my initial calculation, I got about 23.287 GeV. But none of the options match exactly. Wait option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in calculating m_0 c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value for gamma and for the mass.

Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So that's correct.

Now for the mass: the mass of Li-7 is 7 u. 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 7 u is 7 * 931.5 = 6520.5 MeV, which is 6.5205 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 6.5205 GeV.

Let me compute this more precisely:

3.571428
