Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, the benzene has two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together add 2 carbons. Wait, no, wait. Benzene is 6 carbons, and each substituent is attached to it. So if the compound is di-substituted, each substituent is a group attached to the ring. So, for the total to be 8 carbons, the substituents must have 2 carbons in total. Hmm, but wait, substituents can be more complicated. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is one carbon each, but maybe they have more. Wait, the total is 8. Benzene is 6, so substituent carbons add up to 2. So each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons, and the other is none? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

Wait, let's think differently. The molecule must have 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring is 6 carbons, so substituents contribute 2 more. So each substituent is a single group that has one carbon. Because 2 substituents each with one carbon would add up to 2. So, perhaps each substituent is a methyl group? But wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is halogen, such as Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, that seems conflicting because substituents with carbonyl groups and halogens would have more carbons. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps one substituent is
