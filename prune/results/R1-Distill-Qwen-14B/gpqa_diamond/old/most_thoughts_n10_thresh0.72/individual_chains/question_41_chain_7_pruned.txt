Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem says a light beam is moving through glass with refractive index n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So does that affect the speed of light as measured in the lab frame?

Oh right! This is probably a case where we need to consider the relativistic addition of velocities. Because the glass is moving, and light is moving through it, their velocities relative to the lab frame will combine somehow.

Wait, so in the rest frame of the glass (let's call it S'), the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n, right? Because in the glass, light slows down by the refractive index factor.

But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (S). So we need to transform the velocity of the light from S' to S.

Wait, but the direction here is important. The light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in S', the light's velocity is v_light = c/n. Then, when the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction, the observer in the lab (S frame
