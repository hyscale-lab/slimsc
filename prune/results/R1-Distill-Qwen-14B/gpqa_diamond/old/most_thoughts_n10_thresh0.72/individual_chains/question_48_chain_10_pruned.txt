Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Let's break down each step to figure out what each product looks like, especially the final product 4. The main goal is to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms product 4 has.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) forms product 1.
Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When it reacts with bromine, I'm thinking about the possible reactions. Bromine is a good electrophile, and ketones can undergo various additions. Wait, in the presence of a base, perhaps it's an enolate formation, but here the reaction is without a base. Another possibility is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via an enol intermediate. Or perhaps it's a dihydroxyboration type thing? No, that's with borane. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Adding Br2 might do a 1,2-addition. Bromine could add to the carbonyl, making a bromocyclohexanol? Or wait, no, that's maybe in a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexanone undergoes bromination at the alpha position. Because alpha carbons are more reactive. Oh right, alpha bromination. So when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts
