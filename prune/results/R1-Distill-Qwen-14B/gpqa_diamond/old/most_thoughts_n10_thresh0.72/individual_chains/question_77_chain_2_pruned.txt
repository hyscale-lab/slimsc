Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves two reactions: the first one is a reaction using BuLi and then H+, and the second is a Cope rearrangement upon heating. I need to determine the major products A and B from these reactions and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Alright, let's start with the first part, reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me draw the structure to visualize it. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxy group (O), connected to a methyl group (CH2O), and that's attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let me break that down. But-2-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C2. The substituent is at C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. Wait, no. Let me correct that. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2. Or is it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond starting at the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but the substituent is at C3. Wait, no, the substituent is the 3-methyl. So in the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group, the substituent (methyl) is on carbon 3 of the butenyl group.

So, the group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think
