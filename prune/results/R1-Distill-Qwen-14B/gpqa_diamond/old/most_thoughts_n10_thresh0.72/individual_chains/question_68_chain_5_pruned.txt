Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. Oh wait, mu is given as gamma times Sz. Right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. And Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. So mu = γ S_z.

The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment would align with this field, right? Because lower energy when aligned. The energy in a magnetic field is E = -μ·B. So when B is along +Z, the μ aligns with B.

Then, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, when the field is off, what happens? The particle's spin isn't acted upon by any magnetic field, so I guess it's free to precess or something. But then another magnetic field is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. So now the B is in +Y.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh, so we're looking at <μ_z> oscillating over time. What causes that oscillation?

I remember something about spin precession in a magnetic field. When the magnetic field changes direction, the spin precesses around the new field direction. But wait, the initial field was along Z, then it
