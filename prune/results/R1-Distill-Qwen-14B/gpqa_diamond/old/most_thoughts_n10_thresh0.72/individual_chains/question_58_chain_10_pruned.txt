Okay, so I have this question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, let me think. Regularization is a method used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Like when calculations give infinite results, regularization helps to make sense of them by introducing a cutoff or some other method. But wait, the question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) QCD, C) QED, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, wait. So each of these theories is different in terms of where they work and their renormalization needs.

Let me start by recalling what regularization is. I think it's a way to handle infinities that come up in loop calculations. So in quantum field theories, you often get divergent integrals, and regularization is a step before renormalization to make these finite, which then allows you to absorb the infinities into counterterms.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need regularization. That would mean it doesn't have these divergences, or maybe it's a theory that's already finite.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, wait. But wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. Because in classical electromagnetism, you don't do loop integrals the same way as in quantum theories. So does that mean it doesn't require regularization? Because regularization is a quantum field theory tool.

Wait, right. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is option C, you do have divergences. For example, the electron self-energy has divergent loop diagrams, so you
