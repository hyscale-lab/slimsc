Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. Let's see what the given data tells me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. They mentioned a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since the options have O in them, it's likely an O-H group, maybe in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and around 2500-3300. Another thing is if there's a carbonyl group, which would show a strong peak around 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Oh, the FTIR has two peaks there: 1700 and 1650. Hmmm. 

So 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. What about 1650? Could that be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or an acid? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a ketone or something else. Wait, but if the compound has both a carbonyl group and maybe an aromatic ring, that's possible.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene or aromatic ring. So this suggests the compound has a double bond or an aromatic group. For example, benzene rings have vinyl-like protons, but in this case, maybe it's an alkene?

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment at m/z =45. What fragments give 45? Let me think. Common fragments at 45 could be a CH3CO+ (acetate) ion, which is m/z=45 (12+16*2 +1?), wait: CH3CO+ would be (12*2 +1*3 +16) = 59? Wait, wait, no. Let me calculate. CH3CO+ is C2H3O2+. Carbon is 12, so 2*12=24. Hydrogen is 3*1=3. Oxygen is 16*2=32. 24+3=27, plus 32 is 59. Hmm, that's higher than 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl acetate ion? No, same as above. Oh wait, another possibility: the fragment could be C3H7+? C3H7 is 3*12 +7*1=43, but that's 43. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: the mass spec fragment might be a ketene ion or something. Or perhaps it's a cleavage product. Another common fragment is the acetyl group. Wait, CH3CO+ would be 45? Let me recalculate:
