Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I'm supposed to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ, where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction.

Wait, what's the spin state here? It's given as (3i, 4). So, I'll denote ψ as a column vector. That would be ψ = [3i; 4], right? Or wait, in spin notation, sometimes it's written as a row vector, but for the expectation value calculation, I think I need it as a column vector. Oh, wait no, because the expectation value uses the conjugate transpose (dagger) of ψ, which is ψ†. So ψ is a column vector, and ψ† is a row vector with the complex conjugates.

So, ψ is [3i; 4]. So, ψ† would be [ -3 (since the conjugate of 3i is -3), 4 ].

The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, let me write that down:

σ_y = [ [0, -i],
          [i, 0] ]

Now, the expectation value <S_y> is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y, because spin operators are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, right, because S is (ħ/2) σ. So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So when calculating the expectation value, I'll have to include that factor.

So, the steps are: compute ψ† σ_y ψ, then multiply by (ħ/2).

Let me compute ψ† σ_y ψ. So, ψ† is [ -3, 4 ], because the conjugate of 3i is -3 and 4 remains 4.

So, ψ† σ_y is [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y. Let me compute that matrix multiplication.

Multiplying [ -3, 4 ] with σ_y:

First element: (-3)(0) + (4)(i) → 0 + 4i → 4i
Second element: (-3)(-i) + (4)(0) → 3i + 0 → 3i

Wait, wait. Wait, actually, when you multiply a row vector with a matrix, each element of the resulting row is the sum of products of each element of the row vector with the corresponding column of the matrix.

Wait, more accurately, the row vector [a, b] multiplied by the matrix [[c, d], [e, f]] equals [a c + b e, a d + b f].

So, σ_y is:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So, when I multiply ψ† (which is [ -3, 4 ]) by σ_y, it's:

First element: (-3)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 +4i =4i
Second element: (-3)(-i) + (4)(0) = 3i + 0 = 3i

So, ψ† σ_y equals [4i, 3i].

Now, I need to multiply this by ψ, which is [3i;4]. So, the multiplication is [4i, 3i] multiplied by [3i;4].

So, each element:

First term: 4i * 3i = 12 i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 3i *4 =12i.

Wait, but wait, wait. No, because when you multiply a row vector by a column vector, it's the dot product. So, the result is a scalar.

So, (ψ† σ_y) ψ = [4i, 3i] * [3i;4] = (4i)(3i) + (3i)(4).

Calculate each part:

4i *3i =12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

3i *4 = 12i.

So, adding them together: -12 +12i.

Wait, but that's a complex number. Hmm. Now, because the expectation value is a real number for an observable, this suggests I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should have taken ψ as a column vector and done the multiplication in the correct order. Wait, wait, no, the expectation value is ψ† σ_y ψ, which is a scalar. Hmm, but I got a complex number, which can't be right because expectation values of observables should be real.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication.

Let me double-check the calculation.

ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So, ψ† σ_y = [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y.

Wait, let's compute the elements.

First element of the product is (-3)*0 + 4*i = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element is (-3)* (-i) +4*0 =3i +0=3i.

So, ψ† σ_y is [4i, 3i].

Then, multiply by ψ, which is [3i;4], so the product is:

4i *3i + 3i *4.

Wait, that's 4i *3i =12 i² = -12.

Plus 3i *4 =12i.

So total is (-12) +12i.

Wait, that's a complex number, which can't be correct because S_y is an observable, so the expectation value must be real. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the order correctly. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the multiplication should be done in a different way. Oh, wait, no. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step of ψ† σ_y.

Wait another approach: perhaps calculate σ_y ψ first, then multiply by ψ†.

Let me try that.

Compute σ_y * ψ.

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]].

So, ψ is [3i;4].

Multiply each component:

First component of σ_y ψ: 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) +0*(4) = 3i² +0 =3*(-1) = -3.

So, σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3,4 ].

So, ψ† multiplied by σ_y ψ is the dot product of [ -3, 4 ] and [ -4i; -3 ].

So, (-3)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) = 12i -12.

Which gives 12i -12, which is the same as -12 +12i.

Hmm, same result. So, same complex number. That suggests that I'm getting a complex number, but that shouldn't happen.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the conjugate of ψ† in matrix multiplication? No, because ψ† is the conjugate transpose, so it should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again about the spin state. Wait, the spin state is given as (3i,4). So, ψ is a column vector with components (3i,4). So, ψ = [3i;4].

Wait, but perhaps the order is flipped. Wait, sometimes the order is (up, down) or (down, up). No, generally, it's written as [up; down], so when you write (a, b), it's [a; b].

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I forgot that S is (ħ/2) σ, so when I compute <S_y>, it's (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

But even so, the expectation value of σ_y in this state is a complex number, which can't be correct because σ_y is Hermitian, so its expectation value must be real.

Ah, so that suggests that I must have made a mistake in my calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me go through the calculation again.

First, compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

ψ† = [ -3, 4 ].

σ_y = [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

So, ψ† σ_y is [ (-3)(0) +4(i), (-3)(-i) +4(0) ] = [4i, 3i ].

Then, multiply by ψ = [3i;4].

So, [4i, 3i] multiplied by [3i;4] gives 4i *3i +3i *4.

Wait, 4i *3i is 12 i² = -12.

3i*4 is 12i. So, total is -12 +12i.

Hmm. But this is a problem because it's complex, which it shouldn't be for an observable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication. Let me try a different approach, maybe using the actual S_y operator.

Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So, perhaps we can compute the expectation value as (ħ/2) * (ψ† σ_y ψ).

But wait, let me compute ψ† σ_y ψ again correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

ψ† σ_y ψ = [ -3,4 ] * σ_y * [3i;4 ].

Wait, let me compute σ_y ψ first.

σ_y ψ is:

Row 1: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Row 2: i*(3i) +0*4 = 3 i² = -3.

So, σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3,4 ].

So, ψ† (σ_y ψ) = (-3)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = 12i -12.

Which is 12i -12, which is same as before.

Hmm, this gives a complex number, which is impossible. So, where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe the given spin state isn't normalized. Let me check.

The norm of ψ is the inner product ψ† ψ = (3i)*3i +4*4.

Which is (9 i²) +16 = 9*(-1) +16 = (-9 +16)=7.

So, the norm is sqrt(7). But perhaps normalization isn't an issue here, but the expectation value is, but it's giving a complex number, which shouldn't happen.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in ψ. Wait, the state is (3i,4), so ψ is [3i;4].

Wait, when I compute ψ† σ_y ψ, perhaps I should have taken the conjugate of the product. Wait no, because ψ† is the conjugate transpose, so that's correctly done.

Wait, perhaps I should have transposed the multiplication order. Wait, ψ† σ_y ψ is the product of three matrices: (row vector) ψ† multiplied by σ_y (a 2x2 matrix) multiplied by ψ (a column vector). So, perhaps another approach is to compute ψ† (σ_y ψ).

But I did that, and I get 12i -12.

Wait, but this is giving a complex number. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial multiplication.

Wait, another approach: perhaps write the spinor in terms of components and compute the expectation value using the formula.

The spinor is ψ = [a; b], where a = 3i and b =4.

The expectation value is <S_y> = (ħ/2) * ( a* (σ_y)_11 b + a* (σ_y)_12 b* + b* (σ_y)_21 a + b* (σ_y)_22 a )

Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to use the formula:

<S_y> = (ħ/2) [ (ψ† σ_y ψ) ]

Which would be (ħ/2) times [ (a* (σ_y)_{11} a + a* (σ_y)_{12} b + b* (σ_y)_{21} a + b* (σ_y)_{22} b ) ]

Wait, not sure, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps compute each element.

σ_y has elements:

σ_y = [ [0, -i],
          [i, 0] ]

So, ψ† σ_y is [a*, b* ] multiplied by σ_y.

Which would be [ a* *0 + b* *i, a* * (-i) + b* *0 ] → [ i b*, (-i a* ) ]

Then, ψ† σ_y ψ is [i b*, (-i a* ) ] multiplied by [a; b ].

Which gives (i b* ) a + (-i a* ) b.

So, plugging in a =3i and b=4:

i (4)* (3i) + (-i)( (3i)* ) *4.

Wait, let's compute each term.

First term: i *4 *3i = i *3i *4 = 3 i^2 *4 = 3*(-1)*4 = -12.

Second term: (-i) * (3i)* *4 → (3i)* is -3i, so [ (-i) * (-3i) ] *4 → (3i^2) *4 → 3*(-1)*4 = -12. But wait, wait:

Wait, the second term is [ -i * a* ] * b.

a is 3i → a* is -3i.

So, (-i) * (-3i) → 3i^2 → 3*(-1) =-3.

Multiply by b, which is4: (-3)*4 =-12.

Wait, so the second term is -12.

So, first term: -12, second term: -12. So total is -24.

Wait, but that can't be, because when I did the previous calculation, I had a complex number.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute it again more carefully.

Wait, the first term is (i * b* ) * a.

b is 4 → b* is 4 (since it's real).

a is 3i.

So, i *4 *3i = i*(3i) *4 → 3i² *4 → 3*(-1)*4 = -12.

Second term is ( -i a* ) * b.

a is 3i → a* is -3i.

So, (-i) * (-3i) = 3 i² =3*(-1)= -3.

Multiply by b=4 → -3*4 =-12.

So, adding the two terms: -12 + (-12)= -24.

So, <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-12 ħ).

Wait, but that's a real number, which makes sense. So why did my earlier calculation give -12 +12i?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me see. Oh, I think I see where I went wrong. In the first approach, I did ψ† σ_y ψ as [4i, 3i] multiplied by [3i;4], which is [4i *3i + 3i*4] → which is (-12) + 12i. But according to the component method, the correct result is -24.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the order of multiplication in the first approach. Because when I did ψ† σ_y ψ as [4i,3i] * [3i;4], that's incorrect. Because ψ† is a row vector and σ_y ψ is a column vector, so the multiplication would be [4i,3i] * [3i;4], which is 4i *3i +3i *4= 12i² + 12i = -12 +12i.

But wait, according to the component method, the correct result is -24. So that suggests that one of the approaches is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the component approach.

Let me compute it using matrices in a more accurate way.

Compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

ψ is [3i;4]

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

So, σ_y ψ is:

First element: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 → -4i

Second element: i*(3i) +0*4 → 3i² → -3.

So, σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, ψ† is [ -3,4 ]

Multiply ψ† with σ_y ψ:

(-3)*(-4i) +4*(-3) → 12i -12.

Which gives 12i -12. So that's -12 +12i.

But according to the component-wise approach, I got -24.

Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the component-wise approach. Let me try that again.

In the component-wise approach, <S_y> = (ħ/2) [ (ψ† σ_y ψ) ]

Which for ψ = [a; b], is (a*, b*)σ_y [a; b] = a* (σ_y)_{11} a + a* (σ_y)_{12} b + b* (σ_y)_{21} a + b* (σ_y)_{22} b.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct way is:

<σ_y> = sum_{i,j} ψ†_{i} (σ_y)_{i,j} ψ_j.

Which for 2x2 matrices would be:

ψ†_1 σ_y[1,1] ψ_1 + ψ†_1 σ_y[1,2] ψ_2 + ψ†_2 σ_y[2,1] ψ_1 + ψ†_2 σ_y[2,2] ψ_2.

So, substituting:

ψ†_1 = a* = (3i)* = -3i

ψ†_2 = b* =4.

σ_y[1,1] =0, [1,2] =-i, [2,1]=i, [2,2]=0.

ψ_1=3i, ψ_2=4.

So:

Term 1: a* * 0 * a = (-3i) *0 *3i =0.

Term 2: a* * (-i) * ψ_2 = (-3i)* (-i)*4 → (3i²) *4 → 3*(-1)*4 = -12.

Term3: b* * i * ψ_1= 4 * i *3i → 4*3 i² =12*(-1) =-12.

Term4: b* *0 * ψ_2 → 0.

So sum: 0 -12 -12 +0 =-24.

So <σ_y> =-24.

Wait, so <σ_y> =-24, which is a real number, which makes sense.

Thus, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2)*(-24) =-12 ħ.

But looking at the options, option A is -12ħ/25, which is much smaller. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, because I think I made a mistake in the normalization.

Wait, because the spin state isn't normalized. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) +16=25. So the norm is 5. So to make it a unit vector, we should divide each component by 5.

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong. Because the given state isn't normalized, perhaps the expectation value needs to be normalized.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized, but in this problem, perhaps it's given as not normalized. So in reality, the state is (3i,4), but its norm is 5, so the normalized state would be (3i/5,4/5).

So, perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the normalized state.

So, let me correct that.

ψ = [3i/5; 4/5].

Compute <σ_y> =ψ† σ_y ψ.

Compute σ_y ψ first.

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

ψ = [3i/5;4/5].

So, σ_y ψ:

First element: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5.

Second element: i*(3i/5) +0*(4/5) = 3i²/5 = -3/5.

So, σ_y ψ = [ -4i/5; -3/5 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3/5, 4/5 ].

So, ψ† multiplied by σ_y ψ:

(-3/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12i/25) + (-12/25) )

So, 12i/25 -12/25.

Wait, but that's a complex number, which again can't be right because σ_y is Hermitian, so its expectation should be real.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using components.

ψ = [a; b] = [3i/5; 4/5]

σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

So, σ_y ψ = [0*a + (-i)*b, i*a +0*b ] = [ (-i b ), i a ]

Which is [ (-i)*(4/5), i*(3i/5) ].

Compute each component:

(-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5.

i*(3i/5) = 3i²/5 = -3/5.

So, σ_y ψ is [ -4i/5; -3/5 ].

Then, ψ† is [ a*, b* ] = [ (-3i/5), 4/5 ].

So, ψ† σ_y ψ is [ (-3i/5), 4/5 ] multiplied by [ -4i/5; -3/5 ].

Which is (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25.

Sum: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25.

So, <σ_y> =-24/25.

Thus, <S_y> is (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which matches option A: -12 ħ/25.

So, the correct answer is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for the given spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle
\]

### Step 1: Normalize the spin state
The given spin state is \( \psi = (3i, 4) \). The norm of \( \psi \) is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

Thus, the normalized spin state is:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \)
The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Applying \( \sigma_y \) to \( \psi \):

\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -i \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\ i \cdot \frac{3i}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)
The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
= \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right)
\]

\[
= \frac{12i^2}{25} - \frac{12}{25}
\]

Since \( i^2 = -1 \):

\[
= \frac{12(-1)}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
