Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde, and after three steps, we need to find out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11. Hmm.

First, I'll break down each step.

Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1. I remember that Grignard reagents like methyl MgBr are nucleophiles and typically add to carbonyl groups. trans-cinnamaldehyde has the structure CH₂=CH-CHO, but wait, wait. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. So it's more like Ph-CH₂-CHO, but no, actually, wait. No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzaldehyde with a CH₂CH₂ group. No, actually, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde attached to a propenyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Wait, no. I think cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO but no, wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh, wait! Cinnamaldehyde is actually an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So its structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO is not right. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No. No, no, I think it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO is incorrect. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think: Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Wait, no, it's an aromatic aldehyde with a propenyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No. Wait no, wait. The correct structure is Ph
