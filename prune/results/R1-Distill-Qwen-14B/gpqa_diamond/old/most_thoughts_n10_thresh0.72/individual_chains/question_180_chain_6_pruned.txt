Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charges. Let me break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? Which is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each has 2 times that, so 3.2e-19 C each.

Twelve of these are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is that the 13th is at point P, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters away from P. And they're fixed in place, so their positions don't change.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, but I need to figure it out.

Wait, energy in a system of charges. Oh right, I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. Each pair contributes to the total energy.

But wait, since all the 12 charges are identical and at the same distance from the 13th, maybe I can find the potential energy between each and add them up.

Wait, but wait. The system has 13 charges. The first is at P, then the other 12 are at 2m from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from the 13th charge. So the potential energy between each such pair is (k * q1 * q2) / r.

So, we have 12 pairs where each pair is the 13th charge and one of the 12. Each q is 2e.

So the potential energy for each such pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Then, since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy would be 12 times that.

Wait, but wait, I think I might be missing something. Because each of the 12 charges is interacting with the 13th, but the 12 charges are also interacting with each other. Oh wait, but are they? The problem says the 12 are at 2m from point P, but it doesn
