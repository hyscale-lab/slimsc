Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. This causes brightness variations that are observed through photometric time-series data. The interesting part is that this setup can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. 

The question is asking: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve (assuming there are no spots), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star's radius? The options are given as A through D, with numbers around 0.07 to 0.39.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is about comparing the brightness variations caused by a planet transiting a star versus the brightness variations caused by star spots. Without spots, the star's light curve would have variations due to a planet passing in front (transiting) and blocking some light. But in this case, the spots are causing the variations, and we want to find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

Let me break this down. First, I should probably understand how both scenarios affect the light curve.

When a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness (the transit depth) is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. This is because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Now, for the star spots. The spots are cooler and darker, so when they're on the visible side of the star, they make the star appear dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The total brightness change depends on the area of the spots and how much cooler they are.

The problem states that the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% coverage means 0.2 of the star's surface is spotted.

The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The brightness (or flux) from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT^4. So each spot emits less flux than the surrounding.

The variation in brightness would occur as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude of the variation would be the difference between the star's brightness when the spots are on the visible side versus when they're not.

Wait, no. Actually, when the spots are on the visible side, they contribute less light than the rest of the star. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, and the minimum is when the spots are fully visible. The variation would be the difference between these two.

But wait, the star's rotation makes the spots rotate in and out. So when the star is such that all the spots are on the far side (not visible), the star appears at its maximum brightness. As the star rotates, spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness.

But the problem says that the star has one hemisphere with spots. So when the star is viewed from Earth (as it rotates), the spots would be visible for a certain portion of the rotation period.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation period is such that the spots are only on one side. So when the star is facing us with the spotted hemisphere, we see the spots; when it's facing the other way, we don't. So the brightness variation would be a semi-periodic change as the star rotates once, showing spots for a certain time.

But perhaps more accurately, the brightness variation would be the difference in flux when the spots are on the side we're viewing versus when they're not. So the change in flux (ΔF) is the difference between the flux when spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us (the hemisphere we see), the star's total flux is lower. So the star's brightness will dip when the spots are in view.

The change in flux (ΔF) would be F_max - F_min, but actually, F_max is when no spots are visible, and F_min is when all the spots are visible. The amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min) / F_max, so the relative change.

Alternatively, the amplitude of the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) would be the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

Let me model this.

The star's total flux when no spots are visible is F0 = σT^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π D^2) )? Wait, no, let's think in terms of fluxes.

Actually, the total flux from the star is F = (Rstar^2) * (Teff)^4 * (some constants). Or perhaps we can model the flux from the star as the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

The unspotted regions cover (1 - filling factor) of the star's surface. So 80% of the surface is at 6000 K, and 20% is at 5000 K.

Wait, the filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the surface is spots at 5000 K, and 80% is at 6000 K.

The total flux without any spots rotating into view would be F0 = (0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4)) / (6000^4) ), because when all the spots are on the far side, the observed flux is from the full unspotted surface.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, which is the average. When spots are present, their presence would cause the observed flux to dip. So what's the flux when the star is unspotted (no spots visible to us) and when the spots are fully visible?

Wait, when the star is such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are in our line of sight. So the flux from the star would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted 80% and the spotted 20%.

But wait, the problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is the same as Sun's radius, say R_sun.

The flux from a star is proportional to R² T^4. So the total flux F0 when the star is fully unspotted is F0 = (Rstar^2) * (6000^4).

But when the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted = (Rstar^2) * [ (0.8 * 6000^4) + (0.2 * 5000^4) ) ].

Wait, but actually, the area of the spots is 20% of the star's surface. So the unspotted area is 80% of the surface.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F_spotted = (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 * 5000^4) * (Rstar^2) / (4π D^2), but since D is the distance, which is the same for the star and the spots, I can ignore the distance and focus on the relative flux.

Wait, but the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, which is the average. So the presence of spots makes the star have a lower flux because part of its surface is cooler. So the question is, when the spots are visible, the star's flux is lower than when they're not.

Wait, no. The effective temperature is the temperature that gives the same flux as a blackbody radiating uniformly. So when the spots are present, the effective temperature would change. But in this problem, the star's Teff is given as 6000 K, which I think refers to the overall effective temperature without considering the spots. So when the spots are present on the surface, it's like a part of the star is at a lower temperature, thus the total flux would be less than what it would be without spots.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the total flux when spots are visible and when they are not.

Wait, but when the star is not spotted (from our point of view), all the flux is coming from the 80% unspotted regions plus whatever part of the spotted regions are not visible. Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so when we're looking at a hemisphere, the other hemisphere is on the far side. So if only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star is facing us with the spotted hemisphere, we see all the spots. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the spots are on the far side, so we don't see any spots.

Wait, that's an important point. The star is observed from Earth, and it's rotating. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots (so 20% of the total surface), but when the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so we don't see any.

So the maximum flux F_max occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux F_min occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. Because the spots are 20% of the surface, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we are seeing all 20% of the spots. So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be F_spotted = F_unspotted_hemisphere + F_spotted_hemisphere.

But wait, each hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. Wait, that's a point I'm confused about. If the star has one hemisphere covered in spots, does that mean half the surface is spotted? No, the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the entire surface is spotted, regardless of hemisphere.

Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the entire hemisphere (which is 50% of the star's surface) is covered, but only 20% of the entire surface is in spots. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Let me think again. A filling factor of 20% means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. Now, the problem says that these spots are on one hemisphere. So the entire hemisphere (50% of the surface) is covered, but the filling factor is 20% of the total surface, which would imply that only part of the hemisphere is spotted. That doesn't seem to make sense.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the entire hemisphere is spotted, but the filling factor refers to coverage within that hemisphere. No, that's getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the way to interpret it is that, the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, and all of them are on one hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (4π Rstar²) = 0.8 π Rstar². So the area of one hemisphere is 2 π Rstar². So the spots cover 0.2 of the star's surface, which is 0.2 * 4π Rstar² = 0.8 π Rstar². So, they can all fit into one hemisphere (which is 2 π Rstar² area), since 0.8π is less than 2π.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is (area of unspotted regions visible) * their flux + (area of spotted regions visible) * their flux.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are in view. So the unspotted regions would be (1 - 0.2) = 0.8 of the entire star's surface, but wait, no. No, the entire star's surface is either spot or not. So when we're looking at the spotted hemisphere, the part we see is half the star, and of that, 20% are spots. Wait, no. Let's think of the star as a sphere.

The star's surface is 4π R². The spots cover 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R². So the total area of the spots is 0.8 π R².

The problem says that the spots are on one hemisphere. So that hemisphere is 2π R². So the spots take up 0.8 π R² of that 2π R². So the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots is (0.8 π R²) / (2 π R²) ) = 0.4, or 40%. So the filling factor in the hemisphere is 40%. But the problem says the filling factor is 20% of the entire star. That's a bit confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the given data without getting stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spot coverage is 20% of the star's surface, and all of these are on one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. So in that case, the flux when the spots are in view is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions plus the spotted regions.

Wait, but let's model this.

The star's surface has 20% spots (0.2) and 80% unspotted (0.8). The spots are at 5000 K, and the rest at 6000 K.

The flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (so all spots are visible) is the sum of the flux from the spotted areas and the unspotted areas on the hemisphere we're viewing. But wait, no. The hemisphere we're viewing has some parts spotted and others not. Since all the spots are on one hemisphere, when that's facing us, the entire 20% of the surface is in view. But wait, the surface is a sphere, so when a hemisphere is in view, it's half the surface. So if the 20% spots are all on that hemisphere, then 20% is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R². The area of the visible hemisphere is 2 π R², so 0.8 π is 40% of that. So in the visible hemisphere, 40% is spotted, 60% is not.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as follows:

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, all the unspotted regions are visible and contribute their maximum flux (6000 K), and the spotted regions are on the far side, so we don't see them. So the flux in this case is F_max = 0.8 * (6000^4) * Rstar^2, because 80% of the star's surface is unspotted.

Wait, no. Because when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, we're seeing half the star. So the flux would be proportional to the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions in the visible hemisphere plus any spotted regions in that hemisphere, but in this case, all the spots are on the other hemisphere, so the visible hemisphere is 100% unspotted.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think of each hemisphere as either all spotted or all unspotted. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that the star has 20% of its surface covered by spots, and these spots are all on one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, 100% of the spots are visible, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, none are visible.

Wait, but the area of one hemisphere is 2π R². If the spots cover 20% of the entire surface, that's 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R². So the area of the hemisphere is 2 π R². So the spots are 0.8 π R², which is 40% of the hemisphere's area. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the visible surface is spots, and 60% is unspotted. When the other hemisphere is facing us, none are visible.

Hm, perhaps this is the correct approach. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere = 0.6 * (6000^4) * (2 π R² / 4 π R²) ) + 0.4 * (spotted area?), no, wait, no. Let's think in terms of the entire star's flux.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the portion of the star's surface that we see is the unspotted hemisphere. So the area is 2 π R², and all of it is unspotted, because the spots are on the other hemisphere.

Wait, no. Because the spots are 40% of the hemisphere's area. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 40% of that hemisphere is spots, and 60% is unspotted. When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, all is unspotted.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute the average flux when the star is observed in such a way that the spots are visible, and when they are not.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to model the brightness variation as a dip caused by the spots. The amplitude of the dip would be the difference between the star's flux when the spots are visible and when they are not, divided by the star's flux when the spots are not visible.

Wait, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the entire star's surface is spots. So the flux from the spots is F_spots = 0.2 * (5000^4) * Rstar^2. The flux from the unspotted regions is F_unspots = 0.8 * (6000^4) * Rstar^2.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F_spotted = F_unspots + F_spots.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = F_unspots (since the spots are on the far side, not visible). Wait, no. No, because the unspotted hemisphere's flux is 0.8 * (6000^4) * (2 π R² / 4 π R²) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the star's total flux when the spots are visible and when they are not. The maximum flux is when no spots are visible, which would be when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum flux F_max is the sum of the unspotted regions (80%) times their temperature (6000 K), but wait, that's not correct because the unspotted regions cover 80% of the entire star. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2 π R², and all of it is unspotted. So the flux from the unspotted hemisphere is (2 π R²) * (6000^4) * σ / (4 π D²). Wait, but perhaps I should just consider the relative changes.

Wait, let me think in terms of flux fractions. Let’s denote F0 as the flux when the entire star is at 6000 K. So F0 = Rstar^2 * (6000^4) * σ / (4π D²).

But when the star has spots, the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be F_spotted = [ (0.8 * 6000^4) + (0.2 * 5000^4) ] * Rstar^2 * σ / (4 π D²).

Wait, no. Because the spots are 20% of the surface, so the unspotted area is 80%. So the total flux is (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 * 5000^4) times the star's surface area. So F_spotted = (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 * 5000^4) * (Rstar^2) * σ / (4 π D²).

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux would be (0.8 * 6000^4) * (Rstar^2) * σ / (4 π D²) because the unspotted hemisphere is 50% of the surface, and 80% of the entire surface is unspotted. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux would be (0.8 * 6000^4) * (2 π R²) * σ / (4 π D²). Because the unspotted hemisphere is 2π R² and represents 80% of the entire surface.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The entire star has 4π R² surface area. 80% of that is unspotted, so 0.8 * 4π R² = 3.2 π R². The unspotted hemisphere is 2 π R², so when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is (2 π R²) * (6000^4) * σ / (4 π D²) ) + 0 because the spots are on the other side.

Wait, no. Because the unspotted region is 80% of the entire surface, which is 3.2 π R². The unspotted hemisphere is 2 π R², so the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible would be the sum of the unspotted part of the hemisphere and any spots that might be on the hemisphere. But since the spots are on the opposite hemisphere, they are not visible. So the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F_unspotted_hemisphere = (2 π R²) * (6000^4) * σ / (4 π D²).

Wait, but the entire unspotted area is 3.2 π R². So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, we're seeing 2 π R² of the unspotted area. So the flux in this case is (2 π R²) * (6000^4) * σ / (4 π D²) = ( (6000^4) * Rstar^2 * σ ) * (2 π) / (4 π D^2) ) = (6000^4) * Rstar^2 * σ * (1/(2 D^2)).

Similarly, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from the unspotted part of that hemisphere plus the spotted part. The unspotted part of the spotted hemisphere is (0.8 * 2 π R²) = 1.6 π R², and the spotted part is (0.2 * 2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

So the flux when spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted_hemisphere = [ (1.6 π R²) * (6000^4) + (0.4 π R²) * (5000^4) ] * σ / (4 π D² ).

Simplifying that:

F_spotted_hemi = [1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] * π R² * σ / (4 π D² )

The π cancels, so:

F_spotted_hemi = [1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] * R² * σ / (4 D^2 )

Now, the maximum flux (F_max) is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, which is F_unspotted_hemi = (2 π R² * 6000^4 * σ ) / (4 π D² ) ) = (6000^4 * R^2 * σ) * (2 π)/(4 π D²) ) = (6000^4 * R^2 σ) * (1/(2 D^2) )

So F_max = (6000^4 * R^2 σ) / (2 D^2 )

The flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted_hemi = [ (1.6*6000^4) + (0.4*5000^4) ] * R^2 σ / (4 D^2 )

Let me compute the ratio F_spotted_hemi / F_max to find the relative flux.

F_spotted_hemi = [ (1.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ) * R^2 σ ] / (4 D² )

F_max = [ 6000^4 * R^2 σ ] / (2 D² )

So the ratio is:

[ (1.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ) / 4 ] / [ 6000^4 / 2 ]

= [ (1.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ) * 2 ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

= [ (1.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ) ] / [2 * 6000^4 ]

Compute this value.

Compute numerator:

1.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4 )

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Sum: 2.0736e15 + 0.25e15 = 2.3236e15.

Denominator: 2 * 1.296e15 = 2.592e15.

So ratio = 2.3236e15 / 2.592e15 ≈ 0.896.

So F_spotted_hemi ≈ 0.896 * F_max.

So the dip in flux is F_max - F_spotted_hemi = F_max (1 - 0.896) = 0.104 F_max.

So the amplitude of the variation (the dip) is 10.4% of F_max.

Wait, but the problem states that the photometric observations show periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation of the spots. So the amplitude of this variation is 10.4% of the star's maximum flux.

Now, the question is, what radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve if it were transiting?

The transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2. So we need this depth to equal 10.4% of F_max.

Wait, let me think about the transit depth. The flux when a planet transits is F_transit = F_star * (1 - (Rp/Rstar)^2 ). So the dip is F_star - F_transit = F_star * (Rp/Rstar)^2. The amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F_star.

Wait, no. The amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because F_star is the flux when unobstructed, and F_transit is F_star * (1 - (Rp/Rstar)^2 ), so the dip is F_star - F_transit = F_star * (Rp/Rstar)^2. The relative dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, no, because the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F_star, so the relative change is dip / F_star = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

In our case, the dip is 0.104 F_max. So the relative change is 0.104.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.104 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.104) ≈ 0.322.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the numbers. I computed that the dip was approximately 10.4% of F_max, which is F_max * 0.104. So the relative change is 0.104, which equals (Rp/Rstar)^2. So solving for Rp/Rstar would be sqrt(0.104) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when the unspotted is facing. So the variation is F_max - F_spotted_hemi, which I found to be 10.4% of F_max. So the dip is 10.4% of F_max, so the relative amplitude is 10.4%.

Therefore, the transit depth needs to be 10.4%, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.104 → Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.104) ≈ 0.322 Rstar.

So the radius of the planet would be approximately 0.32 times the star's radius. Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So option D is 0.32.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation because the way I computed the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us might not be correct. Let me go back and recheck.

Another approach: The maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Compute the flux when the star is spotted hemisphere facing us.

The flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere is 0.8 of the hemisphere's area (since the spots cover 20% of the entire star, which is 40% of the hemisphere's area). Wait, no. If 20% of the entire star is spotted, and the star's surface is 4π R², the spotted area is 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8 π R². The area of one hemisphere is 2 π R². So the spotted area is 0.8 π R², which is 40% of the hemisphere's area.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the area we're seeing is spotted, and 60% is unspotted.

So the flux from the hemisphere is:

F_hemi = (0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) * (2 π R²) * σ / (4 π D² )

Simplify:

F_hemi = [ 0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] * R² σ / (2 D² )

The maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, which is F_max = (6000^4) * (2 π R²) σ / (4 π D² ) ) = [6000^4 * R² σ ] / (2 D² )

So the ratio F_hemi / F_max is [ (0.6 *6000^4 +0.4*5000^4 ) ] / (6000^4 )

Which is [ 0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 ] 

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 0.4 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.1929.

Adding to 0.6: 0.6 + 0.1929 ≈ 0.7929.

So F_hemi = 0.7929 F_max.

Thus, the dip is F_max - F_hemi = 1 - 0.7929 = 0.2071 → 20.71% dip.

Wait, that's different from my earlier 10.4% calculation. Hmm. I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous approach. Let me re-examine this.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_hemi = [0.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ] * (2 π R²) σ / (4 π D² )

Which can be written as [0.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ] * R² σ / (2 D² )

The maximum flux is F_max = [6000^4 ] * (2 π R²) σ / (4 π D^2 ) ) = [6000^4 * R^2 σ ] / (2 D^2 )

Thus, the ratio is:

[0.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ] / 6000^4 

= 0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 

= 0.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4 

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 0.4 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.1929.

So 0.6 + 0.1929 = 0.7929.

Thus, F_hemi = 0.7929 F_max.

So the dip is F_max - F_hemi = 0.2071 F_max.

So the amplitude is 20.71% of F_max.

Therefore, the dip is 20.71%.

So for the planet to produce the same amplitude, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.2071) ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are 0.32, 0.07, etc.

Wait, perhaps I messed up again. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, when I calculated 0.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4, I used (5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823. So 0.4 * 0.4823 = 0.1929. 0.6 + 0.1929 = 0.7929.

So F_hemi is 79.29% of F_max, so the dip is 20.71% of F_max.

Thus, the dip is 0.2071 F_max, which is the same as (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

But none of the options is around 0.45, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the average brightness variation due to the star's rotation. Because the star's spots are on one hemisphere, when it rotates, we'd see the spots come into view and then go out of view, leading to a periodic dip. But perhaps the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes.

Wait, but when the star is at its brightest (unspotted hemisphere), the flux is F_max = (6000^4) * (4π R²) * σ / (4π D²) ) * (0.8) ? No, that's not right. Wait, no, because the unspotted area is 80% of the surface. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 0.8 * (6000^4) * (2 π R²) * σ / (4 π D²) ) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try a different approach.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ T^4 * 4 π R^2.

When spots are present, the total flux is F_spots = (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) * σ * 4 π R^2 / (4 π D^2) )

But when the star is viewed edge-on, the flux will vary as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to model the variation as the difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes observed as the star rotates.

The maximum flux is when no spots are visible (F_max = 0.8 * 6000^4 * 4 π R² * σ / (4 π D²) ) = (0.8 *6000^4 * R² σ) / D².

The minimum flux is when all the spots are visible (F_min = (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) * R² σ / D².

Thus, the variation amplitude would be F_max - F_min.

So (F_max - F_min) / F_max = [ (0.8 *6000^4) - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) ] / (0.8 *6000^4 )

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] / (0.8 *6000^4 )

= ( -0.2 *5000^4 ) / (0.8 *6000^4 )

= (-0.25) * (5000/6000)^4

= (-0.25) * (5/6)^4 

≈ (-0.25) * 0.4823 ≈ -0.1206.

So the flux dip is 12.06% of F_max.

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = 0.1206, or 12.06%.

Thus, the relative dip is 12.06%.

So for the planet to cause the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1206 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1206) ≈ 0.347, which is approximately 0.35.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, 0.32.

But wait, my calculations are giving around 0.35, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect. Let me think differently.

The problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, which is 0.2 of 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

When the star is observed, the brightness variation is due to the spots being in view as the star rotates. The variation's amplitude is the difference between the star's brightness when no spots are visible and when all spots are visible.

The maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

So F_max = (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *6000^4 ) * ( surface area of unspotted hemisphere ) / (4 π D^2 )

Wait, no, the unspotted hemisphere is 80% of the star's surface. Wait, no, the star's entire surface is 4π R². 20% of that is spotted, so 80% is unspotted. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from 80% of the surface, but since we're looking at a hemisphere, perhaps that's 50% of the star.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this by computing the relative change in flux when the spots are in view.

The maximum flux (F0) is when no spots are visible. The minimum flux (F1) is when all the spots are visible.

So F0 = F_unspotted = 0.8 * (6000^4) * (4 π R²) * σ / (4 π D²) ) = 0.8 *6000^4 * R² σ / D².

F1 = F_spotted = (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) * R² σ / D².

The dip is F0 - F1 = [0.8 *6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4)] * R² σ / D².

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] * R² σ / D².

The relative dip is (F0 - F1)/F0 = [ -0.2 *5000^4 / 0.8 *6000^4 ].

= [ -0.25 * (5000/6000)^4 ]

= -0.25 * (5/6)^4 ≈ -0.25 * 0.4823 ≈ -0.1206.

So the dip is approximately 12.06% of F0.

Thus, the amplitude (dip) is 12.06% of the star's maximum flux.

So the planet would have to cause the same dip, which would require (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1206 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1206) ≈ 0.347.

But looking at the options, option D is 0.32, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the change as the ratio of the star's flux when the spots are in view versus when they are not.

Another approach: The relative change in flux is the difference between the flux when the spots are visible and when they are not, divided by the flux when they are not.

So the amplitude (A) is (F0 - F1)/F0 = 0.1206, or 12.06%.

Thus, the planet's transit depth (Rp^2/Rstar^2) must equal this amplitude. So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1206) ≈ 0.347.

But none of the options is exactly 0.347. The closest is option D: ~0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculations found a smaller dip because I compared the wrong maxima.

Wait, perhaps I should revisit the initial approach. The star's normal flux is F0. When the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F1.

The amplitude is (F0 - F1)/F0 = 0.1206, so 12.06% dip.

So the planet's transit depth must be the same 12.06% dip.

Thus, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1206 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.347.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.39, option D is 0.32. So 0.347 is closer to 0.32, so the answer would be D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness varies as the spotted hemisphere rotates into and out of view.
   - The **maximum flux** occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.
   - The **minimum flux** occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

3. **Flux Calculation**:
   - The star's total flux is proportional to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 
     \[
     F \propto R^2 T^4
     \]
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{max}} = 0.8 \cdot (6000^4)
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = 0.8 \cdot (6000^4) + 0.2 \cdot (5000^4)
     \]

4. **Amplitude of Variation**:
   - The brightness variation amplitude is the relative change in flux:
     \[
     A = \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}}
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     A = \frac{0.8 \cdot (6000^4) - [0.8 \cdot (6000^4) + 0.2 \cdot (5000^4)]}{0.8 \cdot (6000^4)}
     \]
     \[
     A = \frac{-0.2 \cdot (5000^4)}{0.8 \cdot (6000^4)}
     \]
     \[
     A = -0.25 \cdot \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4
     \]
     \[
     A \approx -0.25 \cdot 0.4823 \approx -0.1206
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is approximately \( 12.06\% \).

5. **Exoplanet Transit Depth**:
   - The transit depth of a planet is given by:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of \( 12.06\% \), we set:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1206
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1206} \approx 0.347
     \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.347 \) is closest to **Option D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet must be approximately \( 0.32 \) times the radius of the host star to produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots.

**Answer: D**
