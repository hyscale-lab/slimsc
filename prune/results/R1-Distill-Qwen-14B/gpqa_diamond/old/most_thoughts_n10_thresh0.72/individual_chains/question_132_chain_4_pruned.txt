Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one with diethyl groups.

Hmm, so first, I should figure out what each compound looks like and how their NMR spectra would appear.

The molecular formula for each compound is C10H14. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2 =4. So 4 degrees: probably a benzene ring (3 double bonds equivalent) and one more (maybe a methyl group attached, but that doesn't add a degree). Wait, no, a benzene ring is three double bonds, so the remaining degree is from a single double bond or a ring. Wait, but C10H14... Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents must be four methyl groups (since 6+(4*3)=18 H? Wait, no. Wait, each methyl is CH3. So benzene has 6 H, each methyl adds a CH3, so if there are four methyl groups, the total H would be 6 - (number of H replaced) + 4*3. Wait, no, each methyl replaces a H on the benzene. So 6 H -4 (for four methyl groups) is 2 H left on benzene? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the formula is C6H10 (since benzene plus four methyl groups: each methyl is CH2? No, wait, wait a second.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So the substitu
