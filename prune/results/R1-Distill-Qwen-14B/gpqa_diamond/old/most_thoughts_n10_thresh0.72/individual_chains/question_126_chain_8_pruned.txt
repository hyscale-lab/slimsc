Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products through HPLC. I remember that HPLC can separate compounds based on their interaction with the stationary phase. So, the normal-phase HPLC is usually silica-based, which is polar, and the mobile phase is non-polar. Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase and are used to separate enantiomers.

The problem states that two reactions are done, and their products are combined. Then, they're run on both types of HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Let me first go through each reaction step by step.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. Specifically, hexan-3-one, which is a 6-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3. The substituents: at position 5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure is something like CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, let me get the structure right.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait: hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, I think I'm getting that wrong. Let's think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, more accurately, it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait: the formula for hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So the ketone is on carbon 3. The substituents on the ketone (carbon 3) are CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2OCH3?

Wait the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2-CO-(CH(OCH3))-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So, the 5th carbon is the one with the methoxy group. So the structure is: CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, let me draw it:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So, position 3 is the carbonyl. So carbon 3 is C=O. Then, the groups attached to carbonyl are: one is CH2CH2CH3 (from C4: C3 is attached to C4, which is CH2CH3?), wait no
