Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and their speed relative to an observer. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about a light beam moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in different media. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, here the glass is moving. So does the movement of the glass affect the observed speed of the light?

I think I should consider the frame of reference here. The glass is moving, so maybe I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but the velocity of the glass is given as v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. The observer is in the lab, which is the stationary frame.

In special relativity, when you have two objects moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/cÂ²), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light inside the glass has a speed of v_light = c/n in the glass's frame. So from the lab's perspective, what's the speed of the light?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the lab frame. In the glass's
