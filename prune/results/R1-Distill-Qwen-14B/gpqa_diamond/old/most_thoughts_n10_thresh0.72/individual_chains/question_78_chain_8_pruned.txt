Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The setup is that the charge emits an electromagnetic field, and we're observing it at a later time. 

I remember that potentials are related to the fields via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field. For a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativistic effects and the behavior of the potentials.

Wait, the problem mentions the vector d, which is from where the field was generated at time tr (the retarded time) to the observation point r. So, d is the displacement vector at the retarded time. The velocity at the retarded time is v.

I think the general expressions for the potentials involve retarded times because the fields propagate at the speed of light. So, for potentials, I need to consider the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, specifically the retarded time tr = t - r/c, where r is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by the retarded scalar potential. From what I recall, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1 / (r - (v/c) * t)) ), but I might be mixing up the terms. Alternatively, it's something like V = q/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)) ), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. Or wait, maybe it's d multiplied by c, and subtract the dot product of d and v.

Wait, so the denominator would be something like d c minus (d · v). Because the denominator comes from the term (r - (v/c) t), but r is the vector from the origin to the observation point, but the charge is at a different position at tr. So, perhaps it's better to model the distance as the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, which is d. So d is r - s(tr), where s(tr) is the position of the charge at time tr.

So, the scalar potential should be V = q/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)) ). Because, the denominator accounts for the fact that the charge's position was moving. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, maybe it's (d c + d · v), but that doesn't seem right. Let me think about the units. The denominator should be a length. So, d has units of meters, multiplied by c (m/s), so d c has units m²/s. Hmm, wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, no, because d is a vector, but in the denominator of the scalar potential, which has units of 1/(electric
