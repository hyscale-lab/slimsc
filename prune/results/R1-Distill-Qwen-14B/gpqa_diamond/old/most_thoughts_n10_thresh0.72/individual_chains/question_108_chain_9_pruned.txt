Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question is about a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. Oh right, Oz is the z-axis, so B is pointing upwards. They mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I remember that m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Small m probably means m is not too large, maybe around 0 or 1? Well, I'm not sure, but it might affect the calculation somehow.

The magnetic field is given as 1 Tesla. I know that 1 Tesla is a pretty strong magnetic field, but I'm not exactly sure how it compares to typical fields in atomic physics. Maybe I should look up typical magnetic fields for such experiments. Wait, I recall that Earth's magnetic field is about 25 to 65 microtesla, so 1 Tesla is way stronger than that. So this is a significant field.

The problem is asking to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition has a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, that's the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=3 to n=2. But wait, no, wait, no, wait: I think the Balmer series is transitions down to n=2, so for example, n=3 to n=2. The wavelength 0.4861 micrometers is about 486 nm, which I think corresponds to the H-alpha line. But I'm not 100% sure about the exact transition, but I can work with the wavelength given.

So the transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. The formula is 1/λ = R(1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)), where n1 is the lower energy level and n2 is the higher one. Since the wavelength is about 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm, I can compute ΔE.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the energy levels. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (R h c) / n², where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So the transition energy ΔE would be the difference between two energy levels, say E_initial and E_final. So ΔE = E_final - E_initial. For a transition from a higher n to a lower n, ΔE would be positive.

But wait, for the Balmer series, n_initial is higher than n_final=2. For example, n=3 to n=2. So let's compute that.

First, compute 1/λ. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. So 1/λ = 1 / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 2057171 m^-1.

Using Rydberg's formula: 1/λ = R(1/2² - 1/3²). Let's see, 1/4 - 1/9 = (9-4)/(36) =5/36. So 1/λ = R*(5/36). Let me plug in R=1.097e7 m^-1.

So 1.097e7 * (5/36) ≈ (1.097e7 *5)/36 ≈ (5.485e7)/36 ≈ 1.523e6 m^-1. Wait, but earlier I calculated 1/λ as about 2.057e6 m^-1. Hmm, that doesn't match. Oh wait, this suggests that maybe I made a mistake because 1.523e6 is less than 2.057e6. So perhaps the transition isn't from n=3 to n=2. Or maybe I have to re-express the Rydberg formula correctly.

Wait, maybe the Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R (1/(n_lower)^2 - 1/(n_upper)^2). So for emission, n_upper is higher than n_lower. So in the case of the Balmer series, n_lower is 2. Let's say the transition is from n=4 to n=2. Let's compute that. 1/λ = R (1/4 -1/16 )= R*(3/16). So 1.097e7 * 3/16 is about (3.291e7)/16 ≈ 2.057e6 m^-1. Oh, that matches the 1/λ I calculated earlier. So the transition is from n=4 to n=2, which gives λ ≈ 486 nm. That's correct.

So the energy ΔE would be E_2 - E_4. Since E_n = - R h c / n², the energy levels are negative, and the transition is from a higher n to a lower n, so ΔE is positive. Let's compute ΔE.

E_2 = - R h c / 4, E_4 = - R h c / 16. So ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (- R h c /4 ) - (- R h c /16 )= R h c (1/16 - 1/4) = R h c (-3/16). Wait, that would be negative, but since it's the energy difference for a photon emitted, the energy is positive. So perhaps I should take the absolute value. Alternatively, think in terms of |E_2 - E_4|.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute ΔE in eV. The Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, so E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV, E_4 is -13.6 /16= -0.85 eV. So ΔE is E_4 - E_2 = (-0.85) - (-3.4) )=2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2
