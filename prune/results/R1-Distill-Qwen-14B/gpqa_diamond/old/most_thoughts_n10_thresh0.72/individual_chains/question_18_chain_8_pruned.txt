Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down. So the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each more massive than our Sun. They've given me some abundance ratios, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Wait, the problem mentions LTE and the EW method. Oh right, LTE is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which I think is an assumption that the gas in the star's atmosphere behaves in a way that allows us to use certain simplifications, like using Boltzmann equations for ionization. And EW is Equivalent Width, which is a method to determine elemental abundances from absorption lines. But the exact details of that might not be needed here.

The given data: Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. And Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Wait, I need to figure out what each of these means.

I remember that in stellar abundances, the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of X to Y abundances compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(N_X / N_Y) - log(N_X,sun / N_Y,sun) = log( (N_X / N_Y) / (N_X,sun / N_Y,sun) ).

Wait, no, wait, actually, [X/Y] is defined as log(N_X / N_Y) - log(N_X,☉ / N_Y,☉). So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the element's abundance in the star compared to the Sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun. If it's negative, it's less.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun. Because [X/Y] = log ( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun ). So if [X/Y]=0.3, (X/Y)_star = 10^0.3 * (X/Y)_sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Oh wait, H is hydrogen, so [Fe/H] is the metallicity. [Fe/H] is log(N_Fe / N_H) - log(N_Fe,☉ / N_H,☉). So if [Fe/H] is zero, the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's Fe relative to H. So Star_1 has the same metallicity as the Sun for Fe; because [Fe/H] is zero.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (N_Si, Star_1) / (N_Si, Star_2) ?

Wait, no, wait. The question says "the ratio of silicon atoms" so it's N_S
