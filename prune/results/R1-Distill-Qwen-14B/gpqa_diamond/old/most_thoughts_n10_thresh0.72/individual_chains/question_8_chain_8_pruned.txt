Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The goal is to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the experiment results. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup: They're looking for genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They have three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The results show how resistant each mutant is compared to the wild type. The higher the percentage, the more resistant. So, 100% is maximum resistance. If a plant is less resistant, that means it's more susceptible to the disease.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → pretty resistant, but less than wild type.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% → half resistance.
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. So when g2 is knocked out, the resistance drops to 0%, which is the most susceptible. That suggests G2 is a critical gene for resistance. Also, when G2 is knocked out, any other gene's knockout doesn't change the resistance (since g2g3 and g1g2 are both 0%). So maybe G2 is upstream or a master regulator.

Next, what about G1 and G3? The single mutants g1 is at 75% and g3 at 50%. So without G1, the plant is less resistant but not completely susceptible. Without G3, even more susceptible, but not as bad as without G2. 

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10% → much worse than either single mutant. Similarly, g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%, which is as bad as just g2. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's even worse than either alone. Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, any other gene's knockout doesn't change the resistance. So, G2's presence is necessary for any resistance.

Now, the question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So probably G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout completely abolishes resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, then it might regulate G1 and/or G3.

Looking at the options, all except option A say G2 is the transcription factor. So option A says G1 is a TF, which might not fit because G1's knockout doesn't make them completely susceptible. 

If G2 is the TF, then what? Let's think about the double mutants. For instance, g1g3 is 10% which is worse than g3 alone (50%). So without G1 and G3, it's worse. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be acting in parallel pathways. If G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, then knocking out G2 would make both pathways inactive, leading to maximum susceptibility. 

But looking at the data: when G2 is knocked out (g2), any other knockout doesn't change the phenotype. So any double mutant with g2 is as bad as g2. So, for example, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, then their double knockout would not add anything beyond G2's knockout. But in the case of g1g3, their resistance is 10%, worse than either single (75% and 50%), but since G2 is a TF, maybe G1 and G3 are in different pathways.

Wait, but in the case of g2g3: 0% resistance. So when G2 is out, adding G3 knockout doesn't change anything. Similarly, g1g2 is 0%. So if G2 is the master TF, then any other gene's knockout when G2 is out doesn't matter because the pathway is already broken. 

So now, the double mutants without G2 are all 0%, which makes sense. 

But the other double mutants, like g1g3, have 10% resistance. That's worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both require G2. So knocking out both G1 and G3 would be worse than just knocking out either. But without G2, they can't function anyway.

Wait, but G1 is only partially functional. When G2 is not knocked out, g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. So perhaps G1 is part of a more effective pathway than G3. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. Without G1, G3 can still be expressed (and vice versa), but both are needed for maximum resistance.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So, perhaps G1
