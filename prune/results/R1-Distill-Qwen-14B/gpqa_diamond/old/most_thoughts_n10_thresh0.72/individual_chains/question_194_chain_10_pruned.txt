Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). But wait, no, actually, it's the sum of exp(-E/(kT)), right? And since β is 1/(kT), it's effectively the sum of exp(β E) if E is expressed in terms of energy units.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E_i), where E_i is the energy of state i. So in this case, each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1. So there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

Let me list all possible states and calculate their energies.

Each spin S can be +1 or -1. So the possible combinations are:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Wait, that's 8 states. Now, for each, compute E= -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3].

Let me compute each E:

Case 1: All +1.

S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J(3) = -3J.

Case 2: S3 is -1.

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2
