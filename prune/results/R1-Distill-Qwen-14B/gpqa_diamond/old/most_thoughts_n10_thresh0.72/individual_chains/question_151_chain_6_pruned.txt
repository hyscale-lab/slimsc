Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value of an observable. I remember that observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. The probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, the state of the system is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, I should probably normalize that because the probabilities need to add up to 1. Let me calculate the norm of this vector first. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

The observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that out. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, wait, I think I should check if P is Hermitian because observables must be Hermitian. Let me see. The elements need to satisfy P_ij = P_ji*. Let's see: P_12 is 1/sqrt(2), and P_21 is also 1/sqrt(2). Since they are real, their complex conjugates are the same, so yes, it's symmetric. So P is Hermitian, which is good.

Now, the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is zero, then find the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue, and compute the probability.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way without finding all eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps P when squared gives the identity or something? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe P is a projection operator. Let's see.

Wait, wait, perhaps P is a projection matrix. Because if P^2 = P, then it's a projection. Let me compute P squared to check.

Alternatively, maybe not. Let me calculate the eigenvalues of P. Since it's a 3x3 matrix, maybe it's easier to find them. The matrix P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, this matrix seems to have a certain symmetry. Let's think about the structure. It looks like a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and an orthogonal set of eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues by noticing some patterns. Let me write the matrix again:

| 0       a          0 |
| a       0          a |
| 0       a          0 |

where a = 1/sqrt(2). 

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated. Let's set up the equation for (P - λ I):

[ -λ      a         0 ]

[ a      -λ         a ]

[ 0       a        -λ ]

Now, the determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] - a * [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0*[something]

So, expanding:

-λ (λ² - a²) - a ( -a λ )

Which is:

-λ^3 + λ a² + a² λ

Simplify:

-λ^3 + 2 a² λ = 0

Factoring:

λ (-λ² + 2 a² ) = 0

So the solutions are λ = 0, and λ² = 2 a² → λ = ± a sqrt(2).

But wait, a is 1/sqrt(2), so sqrt(2)*a = sqrt(2)*(1/sqrt(2)) )=1. So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but wait: let's double-check the calculation of the determinant.

The determinant is:

Row 1: -λ, a, 0

Row 2: a, -λ, a

Row 3: 0, a, -λ

The determinant can be calculated by expanding along the first row.

So, it's:

-λ * det [ (-λ, a), (a, -λ) ]  - a * det [ (a, a), (0, -λ) ] + 0 * det(...)

The first term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-
