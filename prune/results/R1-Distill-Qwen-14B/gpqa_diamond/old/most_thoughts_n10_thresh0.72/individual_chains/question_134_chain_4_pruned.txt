Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions generally involve an acid reacting with a base to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem gives three different solutions. So I need to figure out how they react when mixed together. I think I should first determine the moles of each acid and base present.

Let me jot down the given data:

- HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M

So the first step is to calculate the moles of each substance.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so I can calculate moles by multiplying Molarity by Volume in liters.

For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid and a monoprotic acid, so each mole provides one H+ ion.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. That means each mole can donate two H+ ions. So moles = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since it's diprotic, the H+ contribution is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The formula tells me it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH^- ions, right? So moles = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. OH- ions would be 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

But wait, since there are multiple acids and a base, I need to find the limiting reactant. Let's sum up all the H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4:
HCl: 0.1 moles → H+ = 0.1
H2SO4: 0.09 moles → H+ = 0.18
Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. Oh, so OH- is the limiting reactant here. That means all OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

The reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

Wait, but what's the enthalpy change for this reaction? I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. But wait, wait, some sources say it's -57.3 kJ per mole of acid, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. No, actually, the standard value is for one mole of H+ reacting with one mole of OH- to form water. So that would be per mole of H+.

So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's about -57.3 kJ.

But wait, in some cases, like when dealing with different concentrations, people might use different values, but I think in this problem, we're supposed to use that standard value.

So, the reaction here used 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.2 moles of H+. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, the options are in different units. Option D is -16.0 kJ, others are in kcal. Hmm.

Wait, oh! I think I might have made a mistake in the units. Oh right, because 57.3 kJ is per mole. But wait, another point: the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57.3 kJ/mol H+ or OH-. So per mole of H+.

So, in the reaction, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized. So the heat released is 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, but since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative. So -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). But that's not matching any option. Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So, H+ total is 0.2
