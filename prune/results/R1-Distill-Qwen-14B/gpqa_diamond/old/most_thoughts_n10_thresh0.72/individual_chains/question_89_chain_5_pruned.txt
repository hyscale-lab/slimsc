Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating with excess KOH, which probably leads to an elimination or substitution reaction. The product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR and IR data are provided.

Looking at the first product's NMR: The peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the product is likely an adamantane derivative with a ketone group.

Wait, when dibromide reacts with KOH, especially with excess, it's probably an elimination reaction since two equivalents of Br would leave. Dibromides under E2 conditions would form alkenes, but wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe it's forming a diketone? No, wait. Wait a second, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH... Oh, wait, KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction might be a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 positions in adamantane are probably not adjacent. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent carbons in the structure? Or not? I'm a bit hazy on adamantane's structure.

Alternatively, considering the IR data: a strong peak at around 1720, which is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone. So maybe the product is a diketone. Because when two Br atoms are present and they're eliminated with something, perhaps forming two ketones. How?

Wait, when you have a dibromide and you heat
