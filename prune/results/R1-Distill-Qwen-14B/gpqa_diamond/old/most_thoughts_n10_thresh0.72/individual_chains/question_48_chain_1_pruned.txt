Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and think about each reaction.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. Then, it's treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Bromine addition to ketones... I remember that when ketones react with Br2, it's usually an example of a halogenation reaction. Wait, ketones can undergo addition reactions with bromine in a base or acid condition? Oh wait, I think it's the formation of a dibromide via the haloform reaction, but wait, no, the haloform reaction is when you have a methyl ketone. Cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone thoughâ€”it's (CH2)5C-O, so the carbonyl is attached to a cyclohexyl group. So maybe it's an addition of bromine across the carbonyl group.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with bromine in a solution, like in an acid condition, it can undergo a dihydroxybromination. Or perhaps it's more likely a bromohydrin formation? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via the enol mechanism. Wait, cyclohexanone can form enol under certain conditions. So perhaps when treated with HBr, or is it just Br2?

Wait, no, more accurately, the reaction of ketones with bromine (Br2) in a basic condition might lead to the formation of a geminal dibromide. Because in the presence of a base, the carbonyl oxygen gets deprotonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then, Br2 can add across the carbonyl group.

So, cyclohexanone (structure: a six-membered ring with a ketone group) would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. But wait, wait, when you add bromine to a ketone, I think the product is a vicinal dihalide. Or is that for alkenes? Oh wait, no, for alkenes, Br2 adds across the double bond, but ketones don't have double bonds. So maybe the reaction is the addition of HBr in a different context, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps
