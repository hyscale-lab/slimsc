Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which reaction sequence leads to the desired product. Let me take it slow and think through each step carefully.

Alright, the target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me visualize the benzene ring. The substituents are:

- A tert-butyl group at position 2.
- An ethoxy group at position 1.
- A nitro group at position 3.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me draw this out mentally. Position 1 is where the ethoxy is, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. That suggests they're meta to each other in some way, but I'll have to ensure the directing effects are considered.

Now, starting from benzene, what reactions are needed to introduce these groups in the correct positions?

First, I should recall how substituents are introduced. Electrophilic substitution reactions are key here. Benzene can undergo substitution with different groups, and the order in which these groups are introduced will affect the positions where subsequent groups add.

The substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating. Nitro groups are strong meta directors and deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is an activating, since it's an alkyl group, and also a strong ortho/para director.

Wait, but wait. The tert-butyl group is a bulky substituent. Alkyl groups are activating, so they make the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution, and they direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions relative to themselves.

But the order of addition is crucial because each substituent affects where the next one goes.

Let me think about the possible order of adding these groups.

The target has three substituents: nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl. Let's see:

Option 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. But wait, nitro is a meta director, so if added last, where would it go? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced after some other groups to direct its position.

Wait, let me think again. Let's lay out the substituents:

- Position 1: ethoxy (OEt)
- Position 2: t-butyl
- Position 3: nitro (NO2)

Wait, looking at the numbering, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent in a way that each is ortho to the next. But benzene is cyclic, so I should think about their relative positions.

Maybe it's better to consider the substituents in the order they are added.

The question is about the high-yield synthesis. So, the reaction steps should be chosen such that each new substituent is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Let me think about the options given in the choices (A, B, C, D) and see which sequence makes sense.

Alternatively,
