Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being observed. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because shorter period means closer orbit. Also, both have circular orbits. 

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh wait, but same radii. Interesting. So the host stars are similar in size but different in mass. 

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orientation of the orbit. But since both planets are Earth-like, their sizes are probably similar. But wait, actually, the transit probability formula has another factor: the orbital distance. Oh wait, no, the transit probability (P) is roughly given by (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (a / (a * sin i)), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front of the star. The formula for the probability is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a_planet^2), but I think actually it's more like (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2))^(1/2), but wait, since the orbits are circular, e=0. So it simplifies.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing that up. The actual probability is the area of the star that the planet can block, which depends on the relative sizes. But the exact formula I'm a bit fuzzy on. Let me think.

Oh right, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block, divided by the area of the star. But actually, it's more precise to say that the probability is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2. Wait, no, that's
