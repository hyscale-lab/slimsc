Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and sodium cyanide (NaCN) with something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves another compound with reagent B and H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. So the ketone group (butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO) would react with CN- from NaCN. The product is an cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol and a nitrile group attached. The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which makes sense because the cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, forming a secondary alcohol and a nitrile.

Wait, but what's the role of reagent A here? The reaction of ketone with NaCN usually requires an acid catalyst, right? Because the cyanide ion is a weaker nucleophile than, say, an alkoxide, so you need to protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make the carbonyl more electrophilic. So maybe reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is an acid, maybe sulfuric or hydrochloric acid). So for the first step, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a nitrile group attached to a carbon that's also a secondary alcohol. When a nitrile is in such a position, I think it can undergo hydrolysis. But wait, the product here is a carboxylic acid. So nitrile to carboxylic acidâ€”so that's probably a hydrolysis reaction.

How does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that under acidic conditions, especially with strong acids, nitriles can hydrolyze. Alternatively, using a strong acid and water, maybe with heat. Oh wait, another possibility is that in the presence of acid (like HCl or H2SO4), the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid.

But wait, let me think. The starting material is a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group. So maybe the reaction is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile. Alternatively, it could be a Hofmann degradation or something else, but I think it's more likely hydrolysis.

So the reagent B in the second reaction is H2O. Wait, but the question says that the second step uses B (H2O) as a reagent. Wait, no, the question says "reagent B (H2O)"? Wait, no, looking again: the second reaction is with B and H2O. So the reagent B is in addition to H2O. Wait, no, the question says the second reaction is: [compound] + B (H2O) --> product.

Wait, perhaps reagent B is something else, and H2O is part of the reaction. So the reagent B is the catalyst or acid. Let me think.

In the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the typical conditions are strong acid, like HCl, with heat and water. Alternatively, sometimes they use a mixture like H2O with acid. So if the second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group, the reagent B would be HCl (a strong acid) because the nitrile needs to be protonated or something.

Wait, but another possibility is that it's under basic conditions, but then it would form a carboxylate. But the product is a carboxylic acid, so the conditions must be acidic.

So in
