Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime (tau_0) of X⁰ is 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime they experience depends on their speed and the observer's frame. Because of time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame will be longer than the proper lifetime.

Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0 = 8e-16 s. So the lifetime observed in the lab (tau) is gamma multiplied by tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is total energy divided by rest mass energy.

Right, so gamma = E / m. Given that E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV, gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28. So 27 is just a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So gamma is approximately 7.91 or so. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 27 / 3.41. Let me do 27 ÷3.41:

Well, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. Subtract that from 27, we get 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.918. So gamma is approximately 7.918.

So tau (the observed lifetime) is gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8 *7.918 is about 63.344, so 63.344e-16 seconds. Which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Wait, wait, no. Wait 8e-16 multiplied by 7.918 is 63.344e-16 seconds, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds. Because 63e-16 is 6.3e-15. Right.

Now, the particles will move during their lifetime, so the length they travel before decaying is L = v * tau. But wait, how do I find v? Because v is related to gamma as well.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the velocity in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but perhaps there's a simpler way.

Another approach: since gamma is the total energy divided by rest mass, and the total energy is given as 27 GeV. So gamma = 27 /3.41 ≈7.918 as before.

The velocity can be found from beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Let me compute that. Gamma is about 7.918. So 1/gamma squared is 1/(7.918)^2 ≈1/62.7 ≈0.016. So 1 - 0.016 = 0.984. The square root of 0.984 is approximately 0.992. So beta is approximately 0.992c. So v ≈0.992c.

So the speed is about 0.992 times the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So v ≈0.992 *3e8 ≈2.976e8 m/s.

Wait, but perhaps I can get a more accurate beta. Let me compute 1/gamma² more precisely. Gamma is 27 /3.41 = let me compute that exactly. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 *7 is 23.87, subtract that from 27 gives 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is approximately 0.9179. So 7.9179. So gamma squared is (7.9179)^2.

Hmm, 7.9179 squared: 7^2 is 49, 0.9179^2 is about 0.8425, and cross terms 2*7*0.9179=12.85. So 49 +12.85 +0.8425 ≈62.6925. So 1/gamma² is about 1/62.6925 ≈0.01594.

So 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 -0.01594 = 0.98406. Square root of that is sqrt(0.98406). Let me compute that. I know that sqrt(0.9841) is approximately 0.992, because 0.992^2 is 0.984064. So yes, beta is 0.992.

So, the velocity is 0.992c.

So time in lab frame, tau=gamma tau_0. So the time is 7.918 * 8e-16 s = approx 6.334e-15 s.

Wait, 7.918 *8 is 63.344, so 63.344e-16 s is 6.3344e-15 s. So L, the distance traveled before decay, is v * tau. So L= (0.992c) * 6.3344e-15 s.

c is 3e8 m/s. So 0.992*3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiplying by 6.3344e-15 s: 2.976e8 *6.3344e-15 = let's compute that.

2.976e8 is 2.976 x1e8, 6.3344e-15 is 6.3344 x1e-15.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.976 *6.3344 ≈ let's compute that.

2.976 *6 =17.856; 2.976 *0.3344≈approximately 1.0 (since 0.3 is about 0.8928 and 0.0344 is about 0.1023. So total approx 0.995). So 17.856 +0.995= approx 18.851.

Wait, that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, let's compute 2.976 *6.3344 more accurately.

Let me compute 3 *6.3344=18.0032. But since it's 2.976, which is 0.024 less than 3. So 0.024 *6.3344=approx 0.152. So 18.0032 -0.152= approx 17.8512.

Wait, but that's if I subtract 0.024 times 6.3344. So 2.976 is 3 -0.024. So yes, 3*6.3344 is 19.0032? No, wait 3 *6.3344 is 19.0032? Wait, no, 3*6 is 18, 3*0.3344=1.0032, so 18+1.0032=19.0032. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. No, 2.976 is 3 - 0.024. So 3*6.3344 is 19.0032. But since it's 2.976, it's (3 -0.024) *6.3344 = 19.0032 - (0.024 *6.3344).

0.024 *6 is 0.144, 0.024 *0.3344=0.0080256. So total is 0.144 +0.0080256=0.1520256.

So 19.0032 - 0.1520256=18.851174 ≈18.851.

So the product is approximately 18.851.

So 18.851 * 1e8 *1e-15 = 18.851 *1e-7 m. Which is 1.8851e-6 meters, or 1.8851 micrometers.

Wait, 1e8 *1e-15 is 1e-7. So yes, 18.851e-7 meters.

But wait, that's the maximum possible length the particle can travel before decaying. But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Hmm, right. The idea is that in the lab frame, the particle has a certain lifetime, and thus the average length it travels is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Wait, no, more accurately, the length is L = v * tau = beta c * tau. But wait, tau is gamma tau_0.

So L = beta c gamma tau_0 = (beta gamma) c tau_0.

Yes, because tau = gamma tau_0, so L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So L is the average path length before decay. But in reality, the decay can happen at any time between 0 and tau, so the distribution of decay points is a uniform distribution over the length, assuming uniform density in the bubble chamber.

Wait, no, I think the probability distribution for the decay position is not uniform. Because the particle's lifetime is gamma tau_0, so the decay happens at a random time between 0 and gamma tau_0. So the position would be uniformly distributed in the direction of motion, but the actual distribution might be more involved. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the decay length. The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying, which is L = gamma beta c tau_0.

So the average length is L_avg = gamma beta c tau_0. So in our case, that's 7.918 *0.992 *3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute that.

First, 7.918 *0.992 is approximately 7.864. Because 7.918 *1 is 7.918, minus 7.918 *0.008=0.063344, so 7.918 -0.063344 =7.854656.

Wait, 7.918 *0.992 = approx 7.8547.

So 7.8547 *3e8 = 2.356e9.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.356e9 *8e-16 = (2.356 *8) x 1e-7.

2.356*8 is 18.848. So 18.848e-7 meters, which is 1.8848e-6 meters. So approximately 1.885e-6 m.

Wait, that's about 1.885 micrometers.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed. So I think it's about the minimum distance that allows the detection of at least 30% of the decays.

Hmm, the problem is about the minimum resolution, which I believe refers to the minimum detectable decay length that the bubble chamber can resolve. So if the resolution is too low, you can't distinguish events that are too close. Alternatively, perhaps we need to find the maximum possible decay length and the fraction of decays that have a length longer than a certain value.

Wait, but in any case, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps we're to find the decay length such that 30% of the decays have a length longer than that, meaning that only 30% would be detected if the resolution is that.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the maximum distance the particle travels in its lifetime such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. The average path length is L_avg = gamma beta c tau_0. But that's the mean. The distribution of the decay positions is a uniform distribution, I think, in the direction of motion, because the decay is equally likely to occur at any point along the path.

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. The decay probability as a function of time is exponential, but if the velocity is constant, the distribution in distance would be linear in x, where x is the distance traveled. So the probability distribution for the decay position x is such that P(x) dx = (1/tau) (1 - e^{-x/(v tau)}) ) dx, but perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to model the decay length. The decay length D is the maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying. The probability that the particle decays within a distance D is 1 - e^{-D/(L_avg)}, but wait, no. Let me think: the decay follows an exponential probability distribution in time, because the decay rate is lambda=1/tau. So the probability that the particle decays after time t is P(t) = e^{-t/tau}.

The distance traveled is x = vt, so t = x/(v). So substituting, the probability that the decay occurs beyond a distance x is e^{-x/(v tau)}.

Wait, no, the probability that the decay occurs after time t is P(t) = e^{-t/(tau)}. So the probability that x > x0 is the same as the probability that t > x0/(v), which is e^{-x0/(v tau)}.

So the probability that the decay occurs within x is 1 - e^{-x/(v tau)}.

Wait, in our case, we need to find the minimum x such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So 30% is 0.3. So we want to find x where P(x) >= 0.3.

So solving for x in 1 - e^{-x/(v tau)} >= 0.3 → e^{-x/(v tau)} <= 0.7 → -x/(v tau) <= ln(0.7) → x >= - v tau * ln(0.7)

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute ln(0.7). ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667.

So x >= - v tau * (-0.3567) → x >= v tau * 0.3567.

So x = 0.3567 * v tau.

Wait, alternatively, x = 0.3567 * L_avg, since L_avg = v tau.

Wait, because L_avg is v tau.

So, the minimum x to observe at least 30% of the decays would be x = 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The probability that the decay occurs beyond distance x is e^{-x/(v tau)}.

We want the probability of decay within x to be >= 0.3, so the probability of decay beyond x is <= 0.7.

So, e^{-x/(v tau)} = 0.7 → -x/(v tau) = ln(0.7) → x = -v tau ln(0.7) ≈ v tau (0.35667).

So x ≈ 0.3567 * v tau.

But v tau is the average path length L_avg.

So x ≈0.3567 * L_avg.

So if L_avg is 1.885e-6 meters, then x is 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 ≈0.672e-6 meters, which is 6.72e-7 m or 0.672 micrometers.

Wait, but wait, that's the x for 30% of the decays to be within x. So if the resolution is less than this, you can't detect them. Wait, no, perhaps the other way around.

Wait, the problem states that the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is the maximum distance such that 30% of the decays are observed. So perhaps the resolution must be at least equal to the distance x where 30% of the decays are beyond x, or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If the bubble chamber has a certain resolution, say, a minimum detectable decay length of 'd', then it can only detect decays that have a path length greater than 'd'. Because if the decay occurs within a distance less than 'd', the tracks would be too close together to resolve.

So to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need that the probability of the decay occurring beyond distance d is at least 30%, i.e., P(decay >d) >=0.3.

Because then, if the resolution can detect any decay beyond distance d, then 30% of the decays would be detected.

So, we set P(decay >d) =0.3.

Which is e^{-d/(v tau)} = 0.3.

So, d/(v tau) = ln(1/0.3) ≈ ln(3.333) ≈1.2039.

So d =1.2039 * v tau.

Wait, because:

e^{-d/(v tau)} =0.3 → -d/(v tau) = ln(0.3) → d = - (v tau) ln(0.3).

But ln(0.3) is negative, so the negatives cancel. So d = (v tau) * ln(1/0.3) → v tau * ln(10/3) ≈ v tau * 1.20397.

So, d =1.20397 * L_avg.

Because L_avg is v tau.

So with L_avg being approximately 1.885e-6 meters, d would be 1.20397 *1.885e-6 ≈ 2.26e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that accurately.

1.885e-6 * 1.20397: 1.885 *1.20397.

1.885 *1.2 =2.262. 1.885 *0.00397 ≈0.00744. So total is about 2.269e-6 meters, which is 2.269 micrometers.

But looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

B) 2.08e-9 m → 2.08 nanometers.

C) 2.08e-1 m → 20.8 cm.

D) 2.08e-3 m → 2.08 mm.

Hmm, none of the options are 2.269e-6 m. So perhaps my calculation is wrong, or perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-examine the steps.

Ah wait, perhaps I should be using the proper time tau_0 and not considering gamma? No, because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum time resolution needed to measure the decay, but that's not what the question says. It says the minimum resolution in length, so it's about spatial resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the maximum possible decay length, which is when the particle lives exactly its lifetime. So the maximum path is L_max = v * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but the average path is L_avg =v gamma tau_0. So what is L_max? Well, actually, for a given particle, the decay can happen at any time between 0 and gamma tau_0, so the maximum possible L is v gamma tau_0. So the maximum L is the same as the average L? No, that's not possible. Wait, no, the average L is gamma beta c tau_0, which is the same as L_avg = v gamma tau_0, since v=beta c.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing some terms. Let me recompute L_avg.

Wait, gamma is 27/3.41 ≈7.918.

beta is sqrt(1 - (m²c^4)/(E²)) ) = sqrt(1 - (3.41²)/(27²)).

Wait, 3.41/27 is approximately 0.126. So (3.41/27)^2 is about 0.01587. So 1 - 0.01587 = 0.98413. So beta is sqrt(0.98413) ≈0.992, as before.

So L_avg = v gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is 0.992 *3e8 m/s *7.918 *8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute this again.

0.992 *3e8 =2.976e8 m/s.

gamma * tau_0 is 7.918 *8e-16 s =6.3344e-15 s.

So L_avg =2.976e8 m/s *6.3344e-15 s = (2.976 *6.3344) *1e-7 m.

Compute 2.976 *6.3344.

2.976 *6=17.856.

2.976 *0.3344= approximately, let's compute:

0.3 *2.976=0.8928.

0.0344 *2.976 ≈0.1023.

So total 0.8928 +0.1023=0.9951.

So 17.856 +0.9951=18.8511.

So 18.8511e-7 meters =1.88511e-6 m.

So L_avg≈1.885e-6 m.

If the average decay length is about 1.885 micrometers, then to capture 30% of the decays, perhaps the minimum resolution is such that the decay length is at least that.

Wait, but when I set the probability of decay beyond x to be 0.3, I found that x is approximately 2.26e-6 m, which is about 2.26 micrometers, which is a bit over 1.885. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, so the minimum resolution needed is equal to L_avg, which is 1.885e-6 m. But looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, close but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

E =27 GeV.

m=3.41 GeV.

gamma =E/(m c²) → since m is given in GeV/c², but perhaps I should just compute gamma =E/(m) (since E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²) * c² → no, better to think E = gamma m c² → gamma= E/(m c²) * c² → wait no, E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²) * c². Wait, no, sorry, perhaps better to compute gamma as E/(m c²) *c^2? No, no, more accurately, gamma = E/(m c²) because E = gamma m c².

Wait, no, E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But the units here are GeV and GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps this is complicating. Let me think in terms of units. Since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → but when E is in GeV and m in GeV/c², then E/(m c²) is (GeV)/(GeV/c² * c²) )= GeV/(GeV) = unitless, which is correct.

So gamma = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c² * c² ) → but the c² cancels, so 27 /3.41 → approximately 7.918.

So that's correct.

So the average decay length is 1.885e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is a bit higher than 1.885e-6.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay length for 30% probability.

Wait, earlier I thought that to have 30% of decays observed, the minimum resolution would be x= gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(1/0.7), which is about 0.3567 * L_avg → around 0.67e-6 m. But that would be the length at which 30% of the decays are within x, but perhaps the question is about the length at which 30% are beyond x.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think: if the resolution is 'd', then the detector can only resolve decays that occur at a distance greater than 'd' from the point of origin. So the fraction of decays that occur beyond 'd' is the probability we are interested in.

So, F = probability(decay beyond d) = e^{-d/(v tau)}.

We want F >= 0.3 → e^{-d/(v tau)} >= 0.3 → -d/(v tau) >= ln(0.3) → d <= -(v tau) ln(0.3).

Wait, no: e^(-d/(v tau)) >=0.3 → -d/(v tau) >= ln(0.3) → d/(v tau) <= -ln(0.3) → d <= (v tau) * (-ln(0.3)).

But ln(0.3) is negative, so -ln(0.3) is positive. So d <= (v tau) * (-ln(0.3)).

Wait, but wait, let's compute this correctly.

Given F = e^{-d/(v tau)} >=0.3 → take natural log of both sides: -d/(v tau) >= ln(0.3).

Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):

d/(v tau) <= -ln(0.3) → d <= (v tau) * (-ln(0.3)).

So, the maximum d such that 30% of decays are beyond d is d_max = (v tau) * (-ln(0.3)).

Which is d_max = L_avg * (-ln(0.3)).

Because L_avg is v tau.

So, L_avg is 1.885e-6 m.

Compute -ln(0.3) = 1.20397.

So d_max =1.885e-6 m *1.20397 ≈2.269e-6 m.

So the maximum decay length that would include 30% of decays is about 2.269e-6 m. So to observe at least 30% of the decays, the detector's resolution must be at least able to detect decays beyond this distance, meaning the resolution (minimum detectable decay length) should be at least d_max.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed. So the minimum resolution is the maximum distance at which you can still detect 30% of the decays. So the resolution should be equal to d_max, because if the resolution is lower than that, you would detect more than 30%.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this reversed. Let me think: if the resolution is d, then you can only detect decays that are a distance d or more from the origin. So the fraction of decays detected is F = 1 - e^{-d/(v tau)}.

We want F >= 0.3 → 1 - e^{-d/(v tau)} >=0.3 → e^{-d/(v tau)} <=0.7 → -d/(v tau) <= ln(0.7) → d/(v tau) >= -ln(0.7) → d >= (v tau)*(-ln(0.7)).

Wait, wait, that's different than before.

Let me re-express:

We want F = 1 - e^{-d/(v tau)} >=0.3 → e^{-d/(v tau)} <=0.7 → -d/(v tau) <= ln(0.7) → d/(v tau) >= -ln(0.7) → d >= (v tau) * (-ln(0.7)).

Ah, okay, that's different. So d must be at least (v tau)* (-ln(0.7)).

Because:

1 - e^{-d/(v tau)} >=0.3 → e^{-d/(v tau)} <=0.7 → -d/(v tau) <= ln(0.7) → d/(v tau) >= -ln(0.7) → d >= (v tau)*(-ln(0.7)).

So now, ln(0.7) ≈-0.35667, so -ln(0.7)=0.35667.

Thus, d >= (v tau)*0.35667 → d >= L_avg *0.35667.

So with L_avg=1.885e-6 m, d=1.885e-6 *0.35667 ≈0.672e-6 m →6.72e-7 m.

So the minimum resolution needed is d=6.72e-7 m, which is 0.672 micrometers.

But none of the options match this. The options are all around 2e-6 m. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length and the required resolution to observe that. But the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (v tau_0) without considering gamma. No, because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity as a fraction of c, then find the distance.

Wait, another approach: calculate the velocity beta as v = (p c²)/E, where p is the momentum. Because E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/(c).

Wait, but since E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c², perhaps it's easier to compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Which is beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41)^2/(27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (11.6281)/(729)) → 11.6281/729 ≈0.01596.

So 1 -0.01596=0.98404 → sqrt(0.98404)=0.992, same as before.

So beta c = 0.992c.

So the lifetime in lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0 = (27/3.41)*8e-16 s ≈6.3344e-15 s.

So the maximum possible decay length is L = v tau = beta c tau = 0.992 *3e8 m/s *6.3344e-15 s.

0.992*3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3344e-15 s: 2.976e8 *6.3344e-15 = (2.976 *6.3344) *1e-7.

As before, 2.976 *6.3344 =18.85.

So 18.85e-7 m =1.885e-6 m.

So the average decay length is about 1.885e-6 m.

Now, to have at least 30% of the decays observed, we need to find the decay length such that the probability of decay beyond that length is 30%.

Wait, no, because if the detector's resolution is 'd', then it can only detect decays that occur beyond 'd'. So the fraction of decays observed is F = (1 - e^{-d/(v tau)}).

We want F >=0.3 → 1 - e^{-d/L_avg} >=0.3 → e^{-d/L_avg} <=0.7 → -d/L_avg <= ln(0.7) → d >= -L_avg * ln(0.7).

Wait, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567 → -ln(0.7)=0.3567.

So d >= L_avg * 0.3567 → d >=1.885e-6 m *0.3567 ≈6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. The options are in the micrometer range. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 27 /3.41 accurately.

27 ÷3.41:

3.41 *7=23.87 → 27-23.87=3.13 → 3.13/3.41 =0.9179 → so gamma is 7.9179.

Thus, gamma=7.9179.

Beta is 0.992.

So, L_avg= beta * c * gamma * tau_0 =0.992 *3e8 *7.9179 *8e-16.

Compute step by step:

Compute 0.992 *3e8 =2.976e8 m/s.

gamma * tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

Multiply them: 2.976e8 *6.3343e-15 = (2.976 *6.3343) *1e-7.

Compute 2.976 *6.3343:

2 *6=12; 0.976 *6=5.856 → 12+5.856=17.856.

2.976 *0.3343: Let me compute 2.976*0.3=0.8928; 2.976 *0.0343=0.1018. So total 0.8928 +0.1018=0.9946.

So total 17.856 +0.9946=18.8506.

So 18.8506e-7 m =1.88506e-6 m.

So L_avg =1.88506e-6 m.

Now, to find d where F=0.3, which is the probability that the decay occurs beyond d.

So, F = e^{-d/(v tau)} = e^{-d/L_avg}.

Wait, no, earlier I thought F is the probability beyond d, which is e^{-d/L_avg}.

So, if F =30%, then:

e^{-d/L_avg} =0.3 → -d/L_avg = ln(0.3) → d = - L_avg * ln(0.3) → ln(0.3)= -1.20397 → d= L_avg *1.20397.

So d=1.885e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.269e-6 m.

So d≈2.27e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exact.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1.885e-6 *1.20397 exactly.

1.885e-6 *1.20397 → 1.885 *1.20397 ≈ let's compute:

1.885 *1.2 =2.262.

1.885 *0.00397≈≈0.0075.

Total ≈2.2695e-6 m.

So approximately 2.27e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 0.917 of what I computed.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the minimum resolution as the average decay length, not the value for 30% efficiency.

In that case, the minimum resolution would be L_avg=1.885e-6 m, but that's not an option. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from using the average lifetime as the proper lifetime. Let me see.

Wait, tau_0 is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, tau = gamma tau_0. So the average path is L_avg =v tau= beta c gamma tau_0.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the spatial resolution but about the time resolution. But the question says 'minimum resolution', which in this context refers to spatial resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the maximum possible decay length, which is when the decay occurs at the very end of the particle's lifetime. The maximum decay length would be L_max= v *tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is exactly the same as L_avg. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma.

Let me re-calculate gamma.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma=E/(m c²), but since E and m are given in units where c=1, gamma= E/(m) =27/3.41 ≈7.918.

Yes.

So I think my initial calculation is correct, and perhaps the discrepancy comes from a miscalculation in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for us to compute the average decay length and match the closest option.

Wait, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers. My computed L_avg is 1.885e-6 m, so perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the gamma factor. Let me try that.

If gamma is 1, then L= beta c tau_0.

Tau_0=8e-16 s.

So beta c tau_0=0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =0.992 *24e-8 =0.992 *2.4e-7=2.3808e-7 m, which is 0.238 micrometers. That's way smaller, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using tau_0 as the lifetime in the lab frame, which is incorrect.

Wait, if someone mistakenly used tau_0 instead of gamma tau_0, then L= v tau_0 = beta c tau_0.

Which would be 0.992 *3e8 *8e-16 =0.992 *24e-8 = 2.38e-7 m, which is 0.238 micrometers. Again, not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity in a different way.

Another approach: compute the velocity using the relation between energy, momentum, and mass.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) /c.

But since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², and c=1 in these units, it's easier to compute beta as v/c= p/E.

So, E=27 GeV.

m c²=3.41 GeV.

p = sqrt(27² -3.41² ) GeV/c.

Compute 27²=729, 3.41²≈11.6281.

729 -11.6281=717.3719 → sqrt(717.3719)=26.78 GeV/c.

So, beta = p/E =26.78 /27 ≈0.992, same as before.

So that part is correct.

So, v=0.992c.

Now, tau in lab frame is gamma tau_0= (27/3.41) *8e-16= approx 6.334e-15 s.

So, the average decay length is L_avg= v tau =0.992c *6.334e-15 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So 0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.334e-15 s: 2.976e8 *6.334e-15 = 1.885e-6 m.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering 30% as the probability beyond a certain length, but perhaps the question is about the minimum required to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would require a certain fraction of the average length.

Wait, but the option A is 2.08e-6 m. Let me see what fraction that is of the average length.

2.08e-6 /1.885e-6 ≈1.103.

So 2.08e-6 is about 10% longer than the average.

But why would that be needed? If the average is 1.885e-6, and the minimum resolution is this value, then you can detect all decays beyond this length. But that's not the case because the distribution is exponential.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum resolution as the length corresponding to 30% efficiency, which is d= L_avg * (-ln(1-0.3)) → no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the mean life and computing the minimum path length as gamma beta c tau_0 multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of decays observed is proportional to the detection efficiency, which depends on the resolution. The minimum resolution would be such that the decay length is just at the threshold of detection, allowing 30% of the decays to be observed.

So, the decay length for 30% efficiency would be L= gamma beta c tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → ln(1/0.7) ≈0.3567.

So, L= gamma beta c tau_0 *0.3567.

Which is 7.918 *0.992*3e8 m/s *8e-16 s *0.3567.

Wait, wait, no—that's not correct. Because L_avg=gamma beta c tau_0.

So, to find the decay length where 30% are beyond, we need L= gamma beta c tau_0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Which is L_avg * 0.3567=1.885e-6 *0.3567≈6.72e-7 m.

But that leads us back to about 0.67 micrometers, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, which is 1.885e-6 m. But the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo and expects us to compute without considering gamma. Let's see.

If someone ignored gamma, then L=beta c tau_0=0.992 *3e8 *8e-16 = 0.992 *24e-8=2.38e-7 m, which is 0.238 micrometers. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the speed of light as 3e8 m/s but didn't account for the gamma factor correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to be at least the average decay length, which is 1.885e-6 m. But none of the options exactly match.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV.

27 ÷3.41 → let me compute this precisely.

3.41×7=23.87 → 27−23.87=3.13 → 3.13/3.41=0.9179 → so 7.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

Now, beta is sqrt(1−(3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1−(0.12629)^2)=sqrt(1−0.01594)=sqrt(0.98406)=0.992.

So, L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0 =0.992 *3e8 *7.9179 *8e-16.

Compute step by step:

0.992 *3e8 =2.976e8 m/s.

7.9179 *8e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

Multiply 2.976e8 *6.3343e-15: 2.976e8 =2.976 x1e8, 6.3343e-15=6.3343 x1e-15.

Multiply 2.976 *6.3343 = let's compute:

2 *6=12.

0.976 *6=5.856.

2 *0.3343=0.6686.

0.976 *0.3343≈0.3267.

Adding up: 12 +5.856=17.856; 0.6686 +0.3267=0.9953.

Total 17.856 +0.9953=18.8513.

So, 18.8513e-7 m=1.88513e-6 m.

So, the average decay length is 1.885e-6 m.

Now, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, if the resolution is d, then 30% of the decays occur beyond d.

The relation is F=1−e^{−d/L_avg} ≥0.3 → e^{−d/L_avg} ≤0.7 → −d/L_avg ≤ ln(0.7) → d ≥ L_avg * (−ln(0.7)).

Compute −ln(0.7)=0.35667.

So d=1.885e-6 *0.35667≈6.72e-7 m.

But this is 0.672 micrometers, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the maximum possible decay length, which is gamma beta c tau_0, which is same as L_avg. So perhaps the resolution must be at least the L_avg multiplied by a certain factor to ensure 30% detection.

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution as the maximum possible decay length, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the maximum possible decay length such that 30% of the particles decay beyond that length.

Wait, no, that's not matching the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the time resolution, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the velocity from the energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta.

Alternative approach to compute beta:

E = gamma m c^2 → gamma= E/(m c^2).

But when E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², then E=gamma m c^2 → gamma= E/(m c^2) * c^2 → no, no, units don't matter; gamma is E/(m) when units are GeV and GeV/c².

So, gamma=27 /3.41≈7.918.

Then, beta= sqrt(1−1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1−(1/(7.918)^2))= sqrt(1−0.016)=sqrt(0.984)=0.992.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option A) 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers. But in our calculation, the L_avg is about 1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers. So why is the option 2.08e-6 m?

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute gamma more precisely:

gamma =27 /3.41 → 27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7=23.87 → 27−23.87=3.13.

3.13 ÷3.41 → let's compute:

3.41 ×0.917≈3.129, so 0.917.

So gamma=7.917.

Now, beta= sqrt(1 - (1/7.917²)).

1/7.917² ≈1/62.69 →≈0.01595.

So 1 -0.01595=0.98405 → beta= sqrt(0.98405)=0.99201.

So, beta=0.99201.

Now, L_avg= beta *c * gamma *tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

gamma=7.917.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, beta*c=0.99201 *3e8=2.97603e8 m/s.

gamma*tau_0=7.917 *8e-16=6.3336e-15 s.

Multiply these: 2.97603e8 *6.3336e-15 = ?

Compute 2.97603 *6.3336.

2.97603 ×6=17.85618.

2.97603 ×0.3336=0.9928.

So total=17.85618 +0.9928=18.84898.

So, 18.84898e-7 m=1.884898e-6 m.

So L_avg≈1.8849e-6 m.

Now, to find d so that F=0.3.

F= 1−e^{−d/L_avg} =0.3 → e^{−d/L_avg}=0.7 → -d/L_avg=ln(0.7)=−0.35667.

So, d= L_avg *0.35667.

d=1.8849e-6 *0.35667 ≈6.72e-7 m.

Which is 0.672 micrometers.

But again, this isn't one of the options. So perhaps the question intended to find the average decay length, which is 1.885e-6 m, but none of the options match that exactly. So perhaps the correct option is A) 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV.

27 ÷3.41 = let me compute it more accurately.

3.41 ×7=23.87 → 27−23.87=3.13 → 3.13 ÷3.41.

3.13 ÷3.41 = approximately 0.9179 → so gamma=7.9179.

So, 7.9179 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different approach, such as taking the velocity as (p c²)/E.

p= sqrt(E² −m² c^4)/c.

But since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps the calculation is:

p= sqrt(27² −3.41² )=sqrt(729−11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.786 GeV/c.

Then, beta = pc/(E) →26.786 GeV/c * c /27 GeV =26.786/27≈0.99207.

So, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the tau_0 correctly. Wait, no, because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, it's longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the lab frame lifetime without considering gamma. But that would give a much smaller decay length.

Wait, that would be a mistake, but let's see: if someone used tau_0 instead of gamma tau_0.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

v=0.992c →0.992*3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

L=2.976e8 m/s *8e-16 s =2.38e-7 m=0.238 micrometers. But that's option B (2.08e-9 m is nanometers, which is smaller), so no.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculations I'm doing give me a minimum resolution of about 0.67 micrometers, but that's not an option. The only option close to the average decay length is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L_avg. Let me compute it again more accurately.

gamma=7.9179.

beta=0.99201.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, L_avg= beta c gamma tau_0 =0.99201 *3e8 *7.9179 *8e-16.

Compute 0.99201 *3e8 =2.97603e8 m/s.

gamma * tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.33432e-15 s.

Multiply 2.97603e8 m/s *6.33432e-15 s:

=2.97603 *6.33432 *1e-7.

Compute 2.97603 *6.33432.

Let me compute this precisely:

2 *6=12.

2 *0.33432=0.66864.

0.97603 *6=5.85618.

0.97603 *0.33432≈0.97603 *0.3=0.292809; 0.97603 *0.03432≈0.03348 → total≈0.32629.

Now, sum all parts:

12 +0.66864=12.66864.

5.85618 +0.32629=6.18247.

Total=12.66864 +6.18247=18.85111.

So, 18.85111e-7 m=1.88511e-6 m.

So, the average decay length is 1.88511e-6 m.

Now, to find d where 30% of the decays are observed (F=0.3), we have d= L_avg * (-ln(0.7)).

Which is 1.88511e-6 m *0.35667≈6.72e-7 m=0.672 micrometers.

But this is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would be the minimum d where 30% of the decays are observed beyond d.

In that case, the required d is as calculated, 0.67 micrometers. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.

But why? Perhaps the problem is using a different method, such as considering the maximum decay length multiplied by a certain factor, or perhaps a miscalculation in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe any decay, which would just be the average decay length, but that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed of light as 3e8 m/s, and I have a calculation error.

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers.

If I compute L_avg as 2.08e-6 m, what would gamma and beta be?

L_avg= beta c gamma tau_0.

Assuming tau_0=8e-16 s.

So 2.08e-6 = beta *3e8 *gamma *8e-16.

gamma= E/(m) =27/3.41=7.9179.

So,

beta *3e8 *7.9179 *8e-16 =2.08e-6.

Compute 3e8 *7.9179*8e-16 =3e8 *6.3343e-15= 3e8 *6.3343e-15= (3 *6.3343) *1e-7=18.999e-7=1.8999e-6 m.

So, 1.8999e-6 m.

So, beta *1.8999e-6 m =2.08e-6 m → beta=2.08e-6 /1.8999e-6≈1.094.

But beta can't be more than 1. So this is impossible.

So option A is not achievable with these parameters.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the proper time, but I don't think so.

Hmm, I'm not confident with this, but perhaps the intended answer is option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \) with the following parameters:

- Proper lifetime of \( X^0 \): \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \),
- Energy of \( X^0 \): \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Mass of \( X^0 \): \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.918.
   \]

2. **Velocity (\( \beta \)):**
   Using the relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.918)^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.98406} \approx 0.992.
   \]

3. **Average Decay Length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \)):**
   The average decay length is given by:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \gamma \tau_0,
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting the values:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = 0.992 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 7.918 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16}.
   \]
   Breaking it down:
   \[
   0.992 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s},
   \]
   \[
   7.918 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} = 6.3344 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]
   Multiplying these:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = (2.976 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.3344 \times 10^{-15}) \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Minimum Resolution for 30% Detection:**
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the minimum resolution \( d \) must satisfy:
   \[
   F = 1 - e^{-d / L_{\text{avg}}} \geq 0.3.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   e^{-d / L_{\text{avg}}} \leq 0.7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -\frac{d}{L_{\text{avg}}} \leq \ln(0.7).
   \]
   Since \( \ln(0.7) \approx -0.3567 \), we find:
   \[
   d \geq L_{\text{avg}} \cdot (-\ln(0.7)) \approx L_{\text{avg}} \cdot 0.3567.
   \]
   Substituting \( L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   d \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 0.3567 \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options:**
   The calculated minimum resolution \( d \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) (or 0.672 micrometers) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)** (2.08 micrometers). This discrepancy may arise from approximations or differences in interpretation of the problem.

### Conclusion:
