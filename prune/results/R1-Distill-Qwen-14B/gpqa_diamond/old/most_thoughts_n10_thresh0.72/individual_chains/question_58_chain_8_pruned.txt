Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum field theory, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics (CED).

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results nonsensical. Regularization introduces a temporary energy scale or some cutoff to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff in a way that hopefully doesn't mess up the physics.

So, which theories are perturbatively finite or don't have these divergences? I think Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is renormalizable, but even though it's renormalizable, it still requires regularization during calculations. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. So you need to regularize them, maybe using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars methods.

Wait, but wait. There's a theory that's finite. Oh right! There's a thing called a "renormalizable" theory, but some theories might not even need renormalization because they're finite. Oh, but wait, so far, I don't think any quantum field theory is actually finite without any regularization or renormalization. Even QED, which is renormalizable, requires renormalization because of the divergences. So all the quantum theories here probably need regularization.

Wait, but the question is about theories that never require regularization. So maybe the answer is one of the theories that doesn't have these divergences. Or perhaps it's a theory that's non-perturbative and doesn't require the same kind of treatment.

Looking at the options again:

A) Superstring Theory. Oh, right, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity. In string theory, the interactions are different because it's based on strings and not point particles. I think in string theory, the perturbative series is different, but I'm not sure. Do they require regularization when considering high energies? Wait, string theory has a concept called T-duality, which relates different string theories at different energy scales. Also, string theories
