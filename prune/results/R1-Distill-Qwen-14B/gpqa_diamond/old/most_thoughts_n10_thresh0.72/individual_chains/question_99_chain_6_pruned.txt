Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

The question says that the unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR and 1H NMR. Let's start by looking at the FTIR data. The important peaks mentioned are a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. 

I remember that a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because the -OH can hydrogen bond extensively. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid? The peak at 1700 cm^-1 is in the range of a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a strong carbonyl peak around there, so that fits.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says several peaks were observed, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds, meaning no alkenes, which makes sense if we're dealing with a carboxylic acid since those are typically saturated.

Now, the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's break it down. Splitting in NMR comes from neighboring protons. The more neighboring groups with protons, the more splits you get.

So, for the first signal: doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's think about how that happens. Maybe the proton is next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2. But wait, quartets (which are four peaks) come from coupling with three equivalent protons. So if a proton couples with a group that has three Hs, like a CH3, that would split into a quartet. Then, that quartet might be split again into a triplet if it's next to another CH2 group. And that triplet could further split into a doublet. So the hierarchy is quartet then triplet then doublet.

Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex coupling scenario. Let me think of possible structures. The compounds given all have similar parts. Let's look at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, so all options have a COOH group except perhaps some? Let me check. No, all of them have a COOH
