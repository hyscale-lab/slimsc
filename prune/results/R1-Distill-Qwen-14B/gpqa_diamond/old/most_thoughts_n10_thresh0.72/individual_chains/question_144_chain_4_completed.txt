Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And I need to find the mean decay distance from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance L = gamma * v * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But first, I need to find tau, the proper lifetime. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. Oh yeah, Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here. Because ħ is in Joule-seconds, and Γ is given in MeV. I'll have to convert everything into compatible units.

So let's see: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 6.58e-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau is ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. So tau ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Next, I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is E / (m c²), but since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, E/(m c^2) would just be (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Wait, but wait, is E the total energy or just the kinetic energy? Oh, production energy E_X is given, I think that's the total energy. So yes, gamma is E/(m c²). Since m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666666..., which is 20/3.

Now, the velocity v can be found from gamma. The relation between gamma and velocity is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe it's easier to find beta (v/c) first. Beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

Let me compute 1/(gamma^2): gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9). 1/(gamma²) is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887. So v is approximately 0.9887c.

Now, let's compute L = gamma * v * tau. Wait, no: L is gamma multiplied by v multiplied by c multiplied by tau.

Wait, no, beta is v/c, so v = beta c. So L = gamma * beta c * tau.

So putting it all together: L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

We have gamma as 20/3, beta as approximately 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, and tau is 2.057e-24 s.

Wait, wait, let's recheck the tau calculation. Because the width is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, so 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. Right.

So let me compute each part step by step.

Gamma = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (9/400)) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's calculate that.

6.6667 * 0.9887: 6 * 0.9887 is about 5.932, and 0.6667 * 0.9887 is approximately 0.659. So total is about 6.591.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately: 20/3 is approximately 6.666666667.

Multiply by 0.9887:

6.666666667 * 0.9887 = 

Let me compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.666666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591.

Sum: 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913. So gamma * beta ≈ 6.5913.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5913 *3e8 = approx 1.9774e9 m/s.

Multiply that by tau: 1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Hmm, 1e9 * 1e-24 is 1e-15.

So 1.9774 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that.

2 * 2 is 4, but more accurately:

1.9774 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 1.9774 = 3.9548.

0.056875 * 1.9774 ≈ approximately 0.1121.

So total is roughly 3.9548 + 0.1121 = 4.0669.

So 4.0669e-15 meters.

Wait, because 1.9774e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9774 * 2.056875) * 1e9 * 1e-24 = 4.0669 * 1e-15 = 4.0669e-15 m.

Looking at the options: option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. So our approximation is about 4.0669e-15, which is very close to option B.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes.

Wait, perhaps when I approximated beta as 0.9887, I should carry more precise decimals or use an exact expression for beta.

Let me compute beta more accurately.

Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9) ≈ 44.4444444.

1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - (9/400) = (400 -9)/400= 391/400=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775).

What's the square root of 0.9775?

Let me compute it more accurately.

I know that 0.988^2 = (0.988)^2 = (988)^2 * 1e-6 = (976,144) 1e-6 = 0.976144. Hmm, that's less than 0.9775.

Wait, wait: 0.988^2 is 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. So let's compute 0.988 squared is 0.976144. 0.989 squared is (0.989)^2 = 0.978121. Hmm, that's higher than 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is between 0.988 and 0.989.

Compute 0.9885^2: 0.9885 * 0.9885.

Let me compute:

0.9885 × 0.9885.

Compute (1 - 0.0115)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0115 + 0.0115^2.

Which is approximately 1 - 0.023 + 0.00013225 = 0.97713225.

Which is a bit less than 0.9775.

So 0.9885^2 ≈ 0.977132, which is 0.977132, which is less than 0.9775.

So the next step, perhaps 0.9887^2: let's compute 0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 9887 × 9887.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 9887 * 9887.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

Let me write 9887 as 9885 + 2.

So (9885 +2)^2 = 9885² + 2*9885*2 + 2².

9885² = ?

Well, 9885 is 9885, so 9885² = (10,000 - 115)^2 = 100,000,000 - 2*10,000*115 + 115^2.

Wait, 10,000^2 = 1e8.

2*10,000 * 115 = 2,300,000.

115^2 = 13,225.

So (10k -115)^2 = 1e8 - 2,300,000 + 13,225 = 100,000,000 - 2,300,000 is 97,700,000. Adding 13,225 gives 97,713,225.

So 9885² = 97,713,225.

Then, 2*9885 *2 = 2*9885 *2 = 4*9885 = 39,540.

And 2² is 4.

So (9885+2)^2 = 97,713,225 + 39,540 +4 = 97,713,225 +39,540 is 97,752,765 +4=97,752,769.

So 9887^2 is 97,752,769.

So 0.9887^2 is 97,752,769 * 1e-8 = 0.97752769, which is about 0.977528.

Which is just over 0.9775. So the square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, as 0.9887^2 is 0.97752769, which is just a bit above 0.9775.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So gamma * beta is (20/3) * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913.

So that part stands.

Now, let's compute L again:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

gamma * beta ≈ 6.5913.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So: 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s = 1.97739e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 1.97739e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute the exponents: 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

Multiply the coefficients: 1.97739 * 2.056875.

Let me compute this more accurately.

1.97739 * 2.056875.

Breaking it down: 2 * 1.97739 = 3.95478.

0.056875 * 1.97739 ≈ 0.112098.

So total is approx 3.95478 + 0.112098 = 4.066878.

So 4.066878e-15 meters. So approximately 4.0669e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

Let me see if I can calculate it more precisely.

Let me compute 1.97739 * 2.056875.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate 6.5913 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, wait, L = (gamma * beta * c) * tau.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as (gamma * beta) * (c * tau).

gamma * beta is 6.5913.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So c * tau is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, multiply by gamma * beta: 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16.

Compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.

0.5913 *6.170625e-16 = let's see, 0.5 *6.170625e-16 = 3.0853125e-16.

0.0913 *6.170625e-16 ≈ 5.639e-17.

So sum: 3.702375e-15 +3.0853125e-16 = 3.702375e-15 + 0.30853125e-15 = 3.702375 + 0.30853125 = 4.01090625e-15.

Wait, that seems conflicting with the previous calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16.

6 *6.170625e-16 =3.702375e-15.

0.5913 *6.170625e-16 = ?

0.5 *6.170625e-16 = 3.0853125e-16.

0.09 *6.170625e-16 = 5.5535625e-17.

0.0013 *6.170625e-16 ≈ 8.0218125e-19.

So adding these:

3.0853125e-16 +5.5535625e-17 = 3.0853125e-16 + 0.55535625e-16 = 3.64066875e-16.

Plus 8.0218125e-19 is negligible, so about 3.64066875e-16.

So total would be 3.702375e-15 + 3.64066875e-16 = 3.702375e-15 + 0.364066875e-15 = 4.066441875e-15 m.

Which is about 4.0664e-15 m. So that's consistent with the previous calculation.

So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.066e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m → 5e-16

B)4.0655 * 10^-15 → 4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16 → 4e-16.

So the closest is option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but perhaps I should re-calculate the tau. Let me check that step again.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

So all the steps seem correct. The decay length is 4.066e-15, so option B is the correct answer.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \),

we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{20}{3} \), we calculate:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{9}{400} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \):

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = (6.6667)(0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5913.
\]

Next, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = (6.5913)(6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.0669 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The closest value to \( L \approx 4.0669 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
