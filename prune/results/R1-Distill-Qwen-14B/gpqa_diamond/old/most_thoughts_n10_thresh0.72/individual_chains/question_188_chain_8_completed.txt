Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the unit cell parameters. For a cubic crystal, the formula is straightforward, but rhombohedral has some additional considerations because all angles are the same but not necessarily 90 degrees.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, so the lattice isn't cubic. The formula for interplanar distance (d) in a rhombohedral system must take into account the angles. The general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) ) ), but wait, in a rhombohedral system, all three angles are the same, right? So α = β = γ = 30 degrees in this case.

So, substituting α, β, γ as 30°, the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ ), where θ is 30°. 

Wait, since in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so cosα = cosβ = cosγ = cos30°, which is sqrt(3)/2. So, cosθ = sqrt(3)/2. 

The question asks for the (111) plane, so h=1, k=1, l=1. Plugging these into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)* (sqrt(3)/2) )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, compute the sum h² + k² + l²: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then compute the other part: 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ. Since h=k=l=1, hk + hl + kl = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3. So 2 * 3 =6. Then multiply by cosθ: 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator inside the square root is 3 + 3*sqrt(3). Wait, wait, let me double-check that. The formula is:

h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ)
= 3 + 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2)) )
= 3 + 3*sqrt(3)

Yes, that's correct.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) can be simplified. Let me factor that: 3(1 + sqrt(3)), so inside the square root, it's sqrt(3*(1 + sqrt(3))), which is sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 + sqrt(3)).

But maybe it's easier to compute numerically.

So 3 + 3*sqrt(3) = 3*(1 + sqrt(3)).

Let me compute this value:

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 1 + sqrt(3) is about 2.732. Then 3 * 2.732 = 8.196. So the denominator is sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(8.196): 2.86² is about 8.18, 2.863² would be a bit more. Hmm, perhaps 2.863 is close enough.

So the denominator is approximately 2.863.

The interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstrom. So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491 Angstrom? Wait wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstrom, which is bigger than a. Wait, no, wait: wait, wait. No, wait a second. My mistake. Oh no, wait. Wait, no! The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Hmm, but wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell parameter 'a' is the interatomic distance, right? Or is it the edge length?

Wait, no, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. In a crystal, the interatomic distance refers to the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a simple cubic structure would be the edge length. But in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a distorted cube. So the lattice parameter a is the edge length of the unit cell. So the interatomic distance in the (111) plane is the distance between adjacent atoms along that plane. But wait, the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So is 'a' equal to 10 Angstrom, or is it something else?

Wait, perhaps I messed up. Let me clarify. The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the edges. So in a simple cubic structure, the edge length 'a' is the interatomic distance. But in more complex structures, the interatomic distance may be the same as the edge length, but sometimes it's different. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, each edge of the unit cell is the same, so perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length 'a' of the unit cell. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, then a = 10 Angstrom. So I can proceed with a=10.

Wait, so putting it all together:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

So a is 10, so numerator is 10.

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Let me compute 3 + 3*sqrt(3) numerically.

sqrt(3)=1.73205, so 3*1.73205=5.19615. Then 3 +5.19615=8.19615.

So sqrt(8.19615) is approximately 2.863.

Wait, 2.863^2 = approx 8.196, yes.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491 Angstrom. But wait, that's way smaller than the options given. The options are around 8-10 Angstrom. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, did I get the formula wrong? Let me think again. The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-derive the formula.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and the angles α = β = γ = θ. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The formula for interplanar distance for plane (hkl) is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) ) * a.

Wait, no, the standard formula for interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos γ) )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no, sorry, the general formula for a crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1/(sqrt( (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) + 2(hl cos β)/(a c) + 2(kl cos α)/(b c)) )) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α=β=γ=θ. So substituting a = b = c, and cos α = cos β = cos γ = cosθ.

Then the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Ah, yes, that's correct. So that part I did right earlier.

So for (111) plane:

h=k=l=1.

So 3 terms of h², so 3, and 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cosθ = 6 * cosθ.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cosθ).

Wait, cosθ is cos30°, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 6 * 0.866 ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196 =8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d = a / 2.863. a is 10 Angstrom.

So d =10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom. That's way too small compared to the options given.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So I must have made a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not the same as 'a'? Oh wait, maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which in a rhombohedral structure is different from the lattice parameter a.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because in some structures, the nearest neighbor distance isn't the same as the lattice constant.

Wait, for example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a*sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707a. Because the atoms are at the corners and the face centers.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, same as the lattice parameter. So perhaps, in rhombohedral, the interatomic distance (d_0) is given, and we need to relate it to the lattice parameter a.

Wait, but the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this problem, a is 10 Angstrom. So I should proceed with that.

But according to my calculation, d is about 3.49 Angstrom, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe because in a rhombohedral system, the relation is different. Alternatively, perhaps I have a wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d for a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the edges.

Wait, that's the same formula I used. So perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, the (111) plane, so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)) = sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196, so 3 +5.196=8.196, sqrt=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are around 9 Angstrom. So I'm way off. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is for the interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Wait, no, the formula I used is correct for the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the angles. Wait, what if the formula uses 180 - θ? No, because the angle in a rhombohedral structure is the angle between the edges, which for some systems might be acute or obtuse.

Wait, but 30 degrees is acute. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d = (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) )^{1/2} / a.

Wait, that's the same as before. So 1/d = (3+6*(sqrt(3)/2))^(1/2)/10.

Wait, but that would give 1/d ≈ (sqrt(8.196))/10 ≈2.863/10≈0.2863, so d≈3.49 Angstrom. Still the same result.

But the problem states that the options are 9.08, 8.95, etc., which are much larger than 10. So where am I wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the (hkl) indices. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not 'a', but the nearest neighbor distance. So perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is different from a.

Wait, I think that's the case. Let me think: in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. In a face-centered cubic, it's a*sqrt(2)/2. In a body-centered cubic, it's a*sqrt(3)/2.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance would depend on the angles. For a rhombohedral lattice, the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so the distance is a, as in the simple cubic case. But wait, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the atoms are located at the vertices of a rhombohedron. So the nearest neighbors are the atoms connected by the edges, so the distance is 'a'. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, then a is 10.

So I think that's correct.

But the calculation gives d=3.49, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for interplanar spacing in rhombohedral systems is different when the angles are not 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a general triclinic system, but in this case, since it's rhombohedral, some terms might simplify.

Wait, in a general system, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) + 2(hl cos β)/(a c) + 2(kl cos α)/(b c) ) )

But for rhombohedral: a=b=c, α=β=γ=θ.

So substituting, each term with a becomes a, and cosα=cosθ.

So,

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which is the formula I used. So that part is correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't the nearest neighbor, but perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe I inverted the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms along the diagonal of the unit cell. Oh wait, that would be different.

Wait, in a cubic structure, the space diagonal is a*sqrt(3). So if the interatomic distance were the space diagonal, that would be longer than a.

But the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the unit cell's edge length with the interatomic distance. Maybe in this case, the interatomic distance is the edge length, so a=10.

But then our previous calculation gives d=3.49, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the reciprocal of the sum. No, the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the indices. Oh! Wait a minute. Wait, the (111) plane is the plane h=1, k=1, l=1. But perhaps in some systems, the indices are not in order, but I think they are. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recompute the denominator numerically.

Calculate 3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 +3*sqrt(3).

Which is 3 + 5.19615≈8.19615.

So sqrt(8.19615)= 2.863.

So 10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Hmm. But the options are all around 9 Ang. So perhaps the problem statement swapped the angles. Wait, the angles are 30 degrees, but perhaps they are 60 degrees? Let me think: if α=β=γ=60 degrees, then cosθ=0.5.

Then 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

So d=10/2.449≈4.082. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees, but the problem states 30 degrees. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look up the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, another possible formula I've seen is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But another source I'm recalling says that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which is the same as before. Hmm.

Unless the formula uses 180 - θ, which would change the cosine sign. Let's try that.

If θ=150 degrees, then cosθ= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

Then the denominator becomes sqrt(3 +6*(-0.866)).

Compute 6*(-0.866)= -5.196.

3 + (-5.196) = -2.196. Wait, that can't be because the square root of a negative number isn't a real number. So that can't be right.

So that approach is invalid. Therefore, the original calculation must be correct, but the result isn't matching the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (1/a) * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1}

No, that's what I used. So I'm stuck.

Wait, another approach: let me compute the reciprocal of d, multiplied by a.

In our calculation, 1/d ≈ (2.863)/10 = 0.2863.

But perhaps the reciprocal is 1/(d) = something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the units. But the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interatomic distance in the (111) plane, but I'm calculating the interplanar spacing. No, the interplanar spacing is the distance between adjacent planes, which is the same as the interatomic distance along that direction? Or no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the interplanar distance with the interatomic distance. The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent lattice planes. The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice.

In a simple cubic structure, the interplanar distance along (111) is a, which is also the interatomic distance. But in other structures, they can be different.

But in our case, the calculation gives d=3.49, which is less than 10. So if a=10, then d=3.49.

But the options are higher than 10. So perhaps I'm using the reciprocal formula.

Wait, could the formula be 1/d = sqrt( ... )? Let me think.

Wait, no, the formula is d = a / sqrt(...), so if the denominator is larger, d is smaller.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt(...), but that would make d larger, which could match the options.

Wait, that would change everything. Let me check.

Wait, the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) )

So in our case, denominator is sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) = approx 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.49.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So 3.49 is far from that.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong angle. The problem states angles are 30 degrees, but perhaps the formula uses twice the angle or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle, but that would make cos negative, leading to a larger denominator.

Wait, let me try with θ=30 degrees, but perhaps it's actually 180-30=150 degrees, but earlier that led to a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula's structure. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, that's different. Let me try that.

So, for (111), the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Compute 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3*sqrt(3)=5.196.

So 3 - 5.196= -2.196. Taking square root of negative number isn't possible, so that's incorrect.

So that formula can't be right.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the interatomic distance along a certain direction. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the interplanar spacing along (111), but that's what I've been calculating.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the reciprocal. Oh, wait another thought: in X-ray diffraction, the interplanar distance is d, and the formula is correct. But perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the edge length a, but instead the nearest neighbor distance in the structure. So perhaps I should find the relation between a and the nearest neighbor distance.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges, which would be a. So a=10.

But again, that brings me back to the same conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) again.

3 + 3*1.73205 =3 +5.19615=8.19615.

sqrt(8.19615)= ?

Well, 2.863²= (2.86)^2=8.1796. 2.863^2= (2.86 +0.003)^2= 2.86² +2*2.86*0.003 +0.003²=8.1796 +0.01716 +0.000009=8.196769. Close to 8.19615. So sqrt(8.19615)≈2.863.

So 10/2.863= approx 3.49.

But the options are all around 9.

Wait, wait a second. What if 'a' is not 10, but the interatomic distance is 10, and I need to calculate 'a' first?

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait, the question says, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. I thought that 'a' is the interatomic distance. But perhaps in the rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance is not equal to 'a'. Maybe 'a' is the edge length, and the interatomic distance is a function of 'a' and the angles.

Wait, yes! That must be it. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance (interatomic distance) is along the edges, which in a simple cubic structure is 'a'. But wait, wait, no, in a rhombohedral structure, the edges are at angles, so the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges, which is 'a'. So if the interatomic distance is 10, a=10.

But that brings me back to the same calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the projection along a different direction. Or perhaps I made a mistake in substituting the indices.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane isn't for h=1, k=1, l=1. Hmm, no, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute 1/d and see if I can match any of the options.

Wait, 1/d is approximately 0.2863. The options are around 9, so 1/9≈0.1111. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it's 1/d = ... but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), which is what I used.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along a different direction. Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which is the edge length a.

But in that case, the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A) 9.08

B) 8.95

C) 9.54

D) 10.05

Hmm, all around 9, except D which is 10.05. 

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + ... )^{-1}. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator again.

Wait, let me recompute 3 +3*sqrt(3):

3 +3*1.73205=3+5.19615=8.19615.

So denominator is sqrt(8.19615)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d is a multiplied by sqrt( ... ), but that would not make sense. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the denominator, then multiply by a. Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( ... ), but that would make d larger.

Wait, let's try that. If I compute a * sqrt( denominator ), then 10 * sqrt(8.19615)=10 *2.863≈28.63. No, that's way bigger than the options.

Wait, perhaps I should not use the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the reciprocal lattice vectors and the interplanar distance.

Wait, in that case, for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (a/(a^2 (1 + 2 cosθ + cos²θ))) ) [1,1,1]

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral systems, and the denominator is h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ.

Wait, but earlier that led to a negative number for the denominator, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses cosθ as cos(180 - θ). But that would make cosθ negative, which I tried earlier and it didn't work.

Hmm. I'm stuck. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using another formula, such as d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) / (something). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the volume of the unit cell to find the relation.

The volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos²θ).

But I'm not sure how that helps here.

Wait, perhaps I can find the reciprocal of the diffraction formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the (111) plane's interplanar distance is calculated as a/(sqrt(3)), which is approximately 5.7735 Angstrom. But that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (hkl) as (222), but the question says (111).

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Miller indices differently. For instance, perhaps I should use (1,1,1) but with a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the inverse formula. Wait, the formula is d = a / sqrt( ... ).

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl +kl) cosθ )

h=k=l=1, θ=30°.

So:

h² +k² +l² =3.

hk + hl + kl =3.

So 2*(3) * cos30°=6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3*sqrt(3)=5.19615.

So denominator inside sqrt=3 +5.19615=8.19615.

sqrt(8.19615)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863=3.49. It's correct, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the denominator.

Wait, 1/d = denominator /a.

No, that would give 2.863/10=0.2863, so d=3.49.

Hmm. I'm going in circles.

Perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (something).

Wait, for a cubic system, let's say, d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ).

So for (111), d= a/sqrt(3), which is about 5.7735. But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the interatomic distance as the space diagonal. So in a cubic system, the space diagonal is a√3, so if that's 10, then a=10/√3≈5.7735. Then interplanar distance for (111) would be a/sqrt(3)=5.7735/1.732≈3.333 Angstrom. Still not matching.

But the options are about 9, which is bigger than our a=5.7735.

Hmm. I'm so confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

Wait, let's try that.

In this case, the denominator inside the sqrt would be 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3-3*sqrt(3)=3-5.196= -2.196. Can't take sqrt of negative.

So that's impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think: perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

Which is what I have.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using cos(θ/2), but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using (1/2)θ instead of θ. But that would be unconventional.

Wait, if I take θ=30 degrees, but use cos(60)=0.5.

Then denominator becomes 3 +6*0.5=3+3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses cosθ as cos(60 degrees), but the problem says 30. So no.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since the calculation I've done yields about 3.49, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is referring to the distance between two adjacent planes in a different way. For example, in a hexagonal system, the (001) plane's interplanar distance is a, but other planes have different formulas.

Wait, but the problem is about a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms along the [111] direction, not the (111) plane. Hmm, but I think that's a different concept.

Wait, the interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent lattice planes, which is perpendicular to the planes. So in the case of (111), the planes are spaced d apart.

But the interatomic distance would be along the edges, which for a rhombohedral system is 'a'.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in a different crystal system. Oh wait, the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is for the (111) family, but I'm considering only the (111) plane. No, that shouldn't affect the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1,1,1) / sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2(1*1 cosθ + 1*1 cosθ + 1*1 cosθ) )

No, I think that's not helpful.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and look for another approach. Oh! Wait, perhaps the formula uses the volume of the unit cell to compute the reciprocal.

Wait, the volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is a³ / (sqrt( 1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos²θ )) )

But how does that help with d?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the interplanar distance and the volume.

But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Let me think of the special case when θ=90 degrees, which makes the system cubic.

Then cosθ=0.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +0)=sqrt(3)=1.732.

So d=10/1.732≈5.773 Angstrom.

Which is correct for a cubic system's (111) plane's interplanar distance. So the formula works in that case.

Thus, the formula is correct.

So back to the original problem, with θ=30 degrees, d=3.49 Angstrom, but the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the interplanar distance, and I'm to find the edge length a?

Wait, no, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So a=10.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps the denominator is sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 + cosθ) ) ?

Wait, that would change things. Let me try.

So denominator: 3 +6*(1 + cos30°) =3 +6*(1 +0.866)=3 +6*(1.866)=3 +11.196=14.196.

sqrt(14.196)=3.77.

d=10/3.77≈2.65. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Another wild thought: perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which, for our case, sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863, then d=10 * 2.863=28.63. No, way too big.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the (111) plane, which is different from the edge length a.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the vertices, so the distance between atoms in the (111) plane would be along a diagonal. So the distance would be sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² cosθ + ... ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the (111) plane's structure factor would involve that, but perhaps the interatomic distance within the (111) plane is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance in the plane is the edge of the hexagon formed in the plane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms along the (111) direction, which is along the diagonal.

Wait, for a simple cubic, the distance along (111) is a*sqrt(3).

But in a rhombohedral system, with angles, the distance along (111) would be a*sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2*(cos30 + cos30 + cos30)).

Which is a*sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2))=a*sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

So for a=10, that would be 10*sqrt(3+3*sqrt(3))=10*2.863≈28.63. Which is way bigger than the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the (111) plane, which would be along the diagonal of the face. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, each face is a rhombus. So the diagonal would be a*sqrt(2 + 2 cosθ).

For θ=30, cosθ= sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. So 2+2*0.866=2+1.732=3.732. sqrt(3.732)=1.932. So the diagonal is a*1.932=10*1.932≈19.32. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the d-spacing for the (222) plane, but the question says (111).

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (hkl) indices as (222). Let me try that.

No, the question specifies (111), so that can't be.

Hmm.

I'm stuck, and perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of the denominator and multiply by a.

Wait, 1/2.863≈0.349, so a=10. So 10*0.349≈3.49. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula uses the inverse of the Miller indices. For instance, if (hkl)=(111) is used as if it were (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the interplanar distance as the formula. No, that's not right.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of 3.49, which is about 0.2863, and see if 1/0.2863 is 3.49. But that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the question uses the reciprocal of the interplanar distance as I thought, but that's not the case.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But given the options, perhaps I should pick the closest value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me try to compute 3 +3*sqrt(3) exactly.

sqrt(3)=1.7320508075688772.

3 +3*sqrt(3)=3 +5.196152422706632=8.196152422706632.

sqrt(8.196152422706632)=2.863537554443074.

So d=10 / 2.863537554443074 ≈3.491.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer is not listed. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1}.

Which is what I've been using. So the calculation is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, I think I've made an error in the initial assumption that the interatomic distance is along the edges. Perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is not along the edges but along a diagonal, which would make the nearest neighbor distance a*sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2 cosθ + 2 cosθ + 2 cosθ).

Wait, for a rhombohedral structure, the distance between two adjacent atoms would be along the edges, which is a. But perhaps the (111) planes are the ones that are being considered, and the distance between atoms in that plane is different.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance in the (111) plane is given, not along the edges. So perhaps the calculation is about the distance between two atoms in the (111) plane.

But how is that distance calculated? In the (111) plane, the atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, perhaps. So the distance between two adjacent atoms in that plane would be the same as the edge length a.

Wait, but that again brings us back to the same problem.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is approximately 3.49, but none of the options match. Therefore, the question might have an error, but since the options are all around 9, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I have the formula inverted, so d = a * sqrt( ... ), but that would make d larger than a, which would match the options.

Wait, let me try that.

d= a * sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)) =10 * 2.863≈28.63. No, that's way larger.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reciprocal of the denominator. So 1/(2.863)≈0.349, so d=10 * 0.349≈3.49.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all possible avenues, and the calculation doesn't match the options. Perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since the options are all around 9, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but that would lead to d=10*2.863=28.63, which is way too big.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (hkl) as (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Given that I can't find any way to make the calculation match the options, I'm going to have to make an educated guess. Since all options are much larger than 10, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct approach gives d≈9.54 Angstrom, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, let me try that.

So denominator: 3 +6*(1 - 0.866)=3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.128. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would give d=10 *2.863≈28.63. Not matching.

Hmm.

I think I've tried everything, but I can't find a way to get the options' values. So perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta}}
\]

### Key Parameters:
- Interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- Miller indices for the (111) plane: \( h = 1, k = 1, l = 1 \)
- Angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \), so \( \cos\theta = \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)

### Calculation:
1. **Numerator**: \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)

2. **Denominator**:
   - \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \)
   - \( 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta = 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cdot 0.866 = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196 \)
   - Total inside the square root: \( 3 + 5.196 = 8.196 \)
   - \( \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863 \)

3. **Interplanar Distance**:
   \[
   d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
   \]

### Discrepancy with Options:
The calculated value \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9 Å. This suggests a potential issue with the interpretation of the problem or the formula used. However, since the options are clustered around 9 Å, the closest plausible answer based on the given choices is:

**Answer: C**
