Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that these are projectors, right? So each term is a projector onto the respective basis state. But wait, putting them together with 1/2 coefficients. I think this might be a mixed state because the density matrix isn't a pure state.

Wait, pure states have density matrices like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, so they have trace 1 and are idempotent (ρ²=ρ). But this ρ is a sum of two projectors, each scaled by 1/2. Let me check if it's a valid density matrix. The trace should be 1. Each |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| has trace 1, so adding them gives 2, multiplied by 1/2 gives 1. So yes, that's valid.

But what does this represent? Oh right, if you have an equal probability of being in state |0⟩ or |1⟩, that's a completely mixed state. So it's like a classical mixture of the two basis states. 

Now the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I think qubit space is represented as a Bloch sphere, right? Oh wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. For mixed states, it's a point inside the Bloch sphere. But how does this translate to coordinates?

Wait, the Bloch vector represents a pure state |θ, φ⟩ as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). For mixed states, like a completely mixed state, maybe the Bloch vector is zero? Because the density matrix would be (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. For the identity matrix, r would be zero. 

Wait, let me think. The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. If the state is completely mixed, then it's just (I)/2, which would mean r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. So the Bloch
