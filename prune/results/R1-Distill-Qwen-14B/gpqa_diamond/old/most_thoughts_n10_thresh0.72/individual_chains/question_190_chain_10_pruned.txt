Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, and I need to arrange these five nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least. Hmm, nucleophilicity depends on several factors like the solvent, the charge, and the structure of the nucleophile.

The nucleophiles given are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Wait, I remember that in a polar aprotic solvent, nucleophilicity generally correlates with basicity because the solvent doesn't solvate the nucleophile as strongly. But in a polar protic solvent, which is what aqueous solution is, the situation is different. In such solvents, the nucleophilicity is often inversely related to the size of the nucleophile because larger ions are more polarizable and can push through the solvent better. Also, the strength of the base might play a role because stronger bases are often poor nucleophiles in polar protic solvents due to being tightly solvated.

So let me think about each nucleophile:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a conjugate base of an alcohol. It's a strong base because it's an alkoxide, but in aqueous solution, it's going to be solvated by the water. Alkoxides are generally good nucleophiles, but their reactivity can be hindered by solvation. However, the steric bulk might affect how well it's solvated. 4-Methylcyclohexanol's conjugate base could have some steric hindrance because of the methyl group, making it less solvated and maybe more reactive than others.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But in aqueous solution, it's heavily solvated by water molecules, which can hinder its nucleophilicity. So it's not the best nucleophile in aqueous conditions but still quite reactive.

3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) is the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weak base compared to hydroxide because carboxylate ions are weaker bases than hydroxide. So propionate should be a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide in aqueous solution.

4. Methanol (CH3OH) is a neutral molecule. Neutral nucleophiles are generally less reactive in polar protic solvents because they aren't as strong in donating electrons as their deprotonated forms. So methanol is probably the least reactive here. Wait, but wait, the order might be different because sometimes alcohols can be better nucleophiles under certain conditions. Hmm, but in aqueous solution, since it's a weaker base, it's less nucleophilic.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is the conjugate base of ethanethiol. Thiols are weaker bases than alcohols because the S-H bond is weaker, so their conjugate bases are stronger. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the opposite: because H2S is a weaker acid than water, but wait, actually, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no. Wait, pKa of H2S is around 7, while pKa of water is about 15.5. So HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻ because its conjugate acid (H2S) has a lower pKa, meaning HS⁻ is a weaker base. Wait, no—pKa of conjugate acid: stronger the acid, weaker the base. So H2S is a weaker acid than H3O+ (because H3O+ has a lower pKa of around -1.7). So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, I think I'm getting confused
