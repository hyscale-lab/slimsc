Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my classes.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given, so I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right, divergence. Divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. But wait, maybe I can compute the divergence directly first.

Since the field is purely radial, in spherical coordinates, the divergence formula for such a field should be simpler. I remember that for a vector field that's only radial, the divergence is the derivative of the radial component with respect to r divided by r². Wait, let me get the exact expression.

Oh wait, in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field F = F_r e_r + F_θ e_θ + F_φ e_φ is given by (1/(r²)) [d(r² F_r)/dr + (1/sinθ) d(F_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ sinφ)) dF_φ/dφ}. But since in our case, F_θ and F_φ are zero (because the field only has a radial component), the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr.

So F_r is 1/r². Let me plug that into the divergence formula. Let's compute d(r² F_r)/dr. Since F_r = 1/r², r² F_r = r² * (1/r² )= 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Oh! So the divergence would be zero. Wait, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the integral over the volume would be zero? But wait, isn't this similar to the electric field of a point charge?

Wait, wait. The electric field of a point charge is E
