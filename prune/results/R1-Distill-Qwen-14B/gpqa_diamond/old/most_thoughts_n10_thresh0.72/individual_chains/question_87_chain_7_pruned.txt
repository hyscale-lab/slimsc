Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully. 

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options provided.

Hmm, let's break this down. A 6-membered aromatic ring, so that's likely a benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene. The total carbons are 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the substituents themselves can contribute more. Let me think: The benzene is 6 carbons, each substituent can add one or more. But the total is 8, so substituents contribute 2 carbons. Or maybe the substituents plus the ring make 8? Let me make sure.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so the substituents contribute 2. So each substituent has one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other none? No, that wouldn't make sense because each substituent is attached. Wait, perhaps each substituent is a single atom, but that's not possible because the IR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen?

Wait, wait, wait. A carbonyl group is a C=O, which is a substituent. The aromatic-halogen bond would be a halogen attached to the ring. So the substituents are a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, etc.) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

So the two substituents are: one is a carbonyl group, another is a halogen.

So the molecule is benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like -CO-R?), and the other is a halogen (like -X where X is Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, but the carbonyl group is a substituent; how is it attached? If it's a di-substituted benzene, each substituent is possibly a carbonyl and a halogen. So perhaps the substituents are -CO-R and -X, but since the total is 8 carbons, let's calculate.

Benzene has 6 carbons. The substituents: if one substituent is a carbonyl group, which is -CO-. So that's one carbon for the carbonyl (the C in CO). The other substituent is a halogen, which is just an atom, no carbons. So substituent 1: -CO- (from CO group, like maybe a ketone, R-CO-R') but wait, in a benzene ring, substituents are attached directly.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of a side chain. Let me
