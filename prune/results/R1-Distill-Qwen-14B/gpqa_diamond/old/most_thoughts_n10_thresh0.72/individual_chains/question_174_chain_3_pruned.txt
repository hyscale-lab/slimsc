Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission and the kinetic energy difference between relativistic and classical approximations. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 (of the more massive fragment) and the value from the classical approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the system is isolated, momentum should be conserved.

Let me think about the variables. Let me denote the two fragments as fragment 1 (heavier) and fragment 2 (lighter).

Given:
- Fragment 1 is twice as massive as fragment 2. So m1 = 2*m2.
- The sum of their rest masses is 0.99 M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.
So substituting m1 = 2 m2, we get 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M. Wait, no: 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M. But wait, the initial mass is M, but the sum of the fragments is 0.99 M. So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, but the fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99 M, which is less than M. So that means energy was released, which makes sense for fission.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total energy is just its rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy must include the kinetic energies of the two fragments plus their rest energies.

Conservation of energy: initial energy = sum of energies after.

Initial energy: 300 GeV (since it's at rest).

After fission:
