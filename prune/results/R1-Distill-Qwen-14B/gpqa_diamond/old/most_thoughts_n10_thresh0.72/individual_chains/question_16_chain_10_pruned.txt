Okay, so I've got this question here about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. The options are A to D, with numbers ranging from 2 to 5. Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Hmm, this is a butene with a double bond. The configuration is Z, which refers to the arrangement around the double bond. Wait, does the double bond itself have chirality? I don't think so because for a double bond to be a stereocenter, it would need four different groups, but the double bond is between two carbons. But wait, wait. Wait, no, a double bond doesn't have a stereocenter because it's rigid but not a tetrahedral carbon. So this compound is a geometric isomer (cis or trans), but that doesn't make it chiral. So it won't have optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: Oh wow, that's a complex name. Let me parse this. The "E" indicates a double bond configuration. Now, looking at the substituents on the double bond. The molecule has a chloromethylene group, which is CH2Cl, attached somewhere. Wait, but the double bond is between which atoms? If the double bond is between two carbons, each attached to certain groups. Let's think about the substituents. For a double bond to have E/Z isomerism, the groups on each carbon must be different. But does it have chirality? If the double bond is part of a ring, like in a bicyclic structure, maybe the arrangement leads to a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a stereogenic center. Wait, the substituents on the double bond: one end has a chloromethylene (Cl and another CH2 group?), but is that enough for a stereocenter? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a bridge or a ring that gives it chirality. Alternatively, maybe the substituents
