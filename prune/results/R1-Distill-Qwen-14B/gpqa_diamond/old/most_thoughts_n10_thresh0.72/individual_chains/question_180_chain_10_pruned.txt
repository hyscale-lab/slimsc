Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem states: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I guess I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So, the particles are identical and have the same charge, which is 2e. Each one is 2 coulombs multiplied by the elementary charge. Wait, no, wait. Wait, e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So 2e would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C. Right.

Now, the setup: 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, the 13th is probably the fixed one, and the others are around it. Wait, but wait, the problem says the 13th is fixed at P, and the 12 are at 2 m from P. So maybe the system is like a central charge with 12 others arranged in some way around it, each at 2 m distance.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of them is at a distance of 2 m from P. So the 13th is at P, the center, and the others are on a sphere of radius 2 m around it.

Now, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because in an isolated system, the energy would be the potential energy due to their mutual electrostatic interactions.

Wait, but wait, the total potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each pair of charges, you calculate the potential energy and sum them all up.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so maybe it's part of the system too
