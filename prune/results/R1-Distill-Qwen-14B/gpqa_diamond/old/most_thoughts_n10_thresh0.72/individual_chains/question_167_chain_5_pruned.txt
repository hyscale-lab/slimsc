Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The state given is a Schroedinger cat state, which I remember are these superpositions of coherent states. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha^2)). 

The problem asks for the calculation of non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state and rho is our non-Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, right? Coherent states are Gaussian, but when you superpose them, you get a non-Gaussian state. So the cat state here is non-Gaussian, and we're to find how non-Gaussian it is compared to a Gaussian state.

But wait, wait. The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity here is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the state's distribution and a Gaussian reference. Or maybe it's the difference in their entropy? Because del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau.

Wait, the von Neumann entropy S is given by -trace(rho ln rho). So if tau is a Gaussian state, and rho is the cat state, then del_b would be (S(rho) - S(tau)). But wait, the formula given is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] which is (S(rho) - S(tau)) = del_b. So non-Gaussianity is this difference. But wait, usually, non-Gaussianity measures quantify how non-Gaussian a state is, so if the state is Gaussian, del_b would be zero. So if the state is Gaussian, the measure should be zero.

Wait, but in this case, the state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian. So for a Gaussian state, del_b is zero, but for non-Gaussian, it's positive. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes these measures can have specific properties.

But let's get into the problem. The given parameters are
