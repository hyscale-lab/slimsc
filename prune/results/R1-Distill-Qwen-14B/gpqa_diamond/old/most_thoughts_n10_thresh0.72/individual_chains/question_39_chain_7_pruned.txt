Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but I remember that wave functions in quantum mechanics need to satisfy certain conditions, right? Oh right, the wave function must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be finite. Also, since particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this region. But wait, the given wave function isn't zero outside x=1 to x=3. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe it's not the actual wave function but something else. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So maybe the given function is part of the wave function in that interval, and zero otherwise.

So the wave function is probably something like ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. But wait, the wave function should be continuous, but since it's zero outside, perhaps this is the part where it's non-zero.

But wait, the wave function also needs to be normalized. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Because the total probability must be 1.

Right,
