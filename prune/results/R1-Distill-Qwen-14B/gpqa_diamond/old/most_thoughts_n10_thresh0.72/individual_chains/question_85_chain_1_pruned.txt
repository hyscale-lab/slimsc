Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and a few other factors. Let me try to break this down.

First, the problem gives me two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. Both are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably means the same reflectivity. I think albedo affects the absorbed light, so that might cancel out in the temperature ratio.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe I should think about it more accurately. Oh right, it's T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since both have the same albedo, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the main variables will be the star's parameters and the planets' distances. But wait, how do I find the distance 'a' for each planet? Because the problem gives me the Doppler shifts, which relate to the RV method. Oh, right! The radial velocity method measures the star's velocity towards us, which is due to the planet's gravitational pull. The RV shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance.

Wait, but the question gives the shifts for each planet on the same forbidden line. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So I think I need to find their velocities from these shifts. Then, since RV velocity (v) relates to the mass of the planet and the distance.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So delta_lambda is either 0.03 or 0.04 Å. Let me compute the velocities for each planet.

For Planet1: delta_lambda = 0.03 Å. So v1 = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. Similarly for Planet2.

But wait, the star's velocity is being measured, so the RV method gives the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for velocity is v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin(i)) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ), but that might be complicated. Alternatively, since the problem gives the Doppler shifts for both planets on the same line, perhaps we can relate their velocities to each
