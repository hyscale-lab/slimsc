Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen signals will be in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem starts with acetic acid being treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride under heating. Wait, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with bromine in the presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride, it's probably undergoing some kind of substitution or addition reaction. Br2, pyridine... Oh, right! That's the bromination of the carbonyl group. Wait, noâ€”pyridine can act as a base, maybe absorbing HBr. So, acetic acid has a -COOH group. When it reacts with Br2 and acetic anhydride, I think it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation scenario, but wait, acetic acid isn't aromatic. Hmm. Alternatively, bromine could be adding to the carbonyl, but that would be more like a dibromide. Or perhaps it's a bromination of the alpha position. Wait, acetic acid has the structure CH3COOH. The alpha carbons are the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. So, could it be undergoing alpha-bromination?

Wait, another thought: when you have a ketone or aldehyde, adding Br2 with a base like pyridine can lead to the formation of a
