Okay, so I've got this genetics problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The scenario is about white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some experiments with knockout mutants and double mutants to find out which genes contribute to resistance. The three genes are G1, G2, G3. The results they got from testing the mutants' resistance levels are given.

First, I need to understand what each part of the data means. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance, so the plants are quite resistant. The mutants have varying percentages: g1 is 75%, which is less than control but not totally susceptible. g2 is 0%, which means those plants are completely susceptible. g3 is 50%, so half the resistance. The double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is very low; g2g3 and g1g2 are both 0%, meaning no resistance.

The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes. They mention that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, maybe it's a regulatory gene.

Let me think about how gene interactions work. When you have a double mutant, say g1g3, the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. Hmm, that suggests that G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway, perhaps redundant? Or maybe they function in parallel pathways.

Wait, another thought: in genetics, if two genes function in the same pathway, their double mutant might not be worse than the worse single mutant. Alternatively, if they're in parallel pathways (like redundancy), the double mutant might be worse than either single. So let's see the data.

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% which is worse than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is really low. So perhaps they were providing additive effects when each was present. Or maybe they're in the same pathway, but G1 is upstream of G3.

Wait, but when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower. Hmm, another possibility: maybe G1 is upstream and G3 is downstream. So if G1 is non-functional, perhaps G3 can't compensate, and vice versa. Or maybe they're in parallel pathways, so both need to be knocked out to see the full effect.

Wait, but g1 has 75% resistance. Wild type is 100%, so knocking out G1 reduces resistance. Similarly, g3 is 50%, which is more severe. So G3 knockout is worse than G1 knockout.

Now, the double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either. So if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps G1 is upstream of G3. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 can't be expressed or can't function, which would explain why g1g3 isn't any worse than g3 alone. But that's not what we're seeing here. Because in g3 alone, it's 50%, but with G1 also knocked out, it's 10%. So that suggests that perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because if each provides some resistance, knocking both would cause a bigger effect. Oh, that makes sense. So G1 and G3 might be redundant. Or maybe they are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about epistasis. Epistatic relationships can tell us about the order
