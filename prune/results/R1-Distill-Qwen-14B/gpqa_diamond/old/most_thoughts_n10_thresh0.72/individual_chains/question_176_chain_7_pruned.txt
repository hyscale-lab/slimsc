Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll have to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a three-component vector, so it's a 3-dimensional state. Oh, right, so the system is in a 3-level quantum system.

The operators for observables P and Q are given as square matrices. I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q, with the measurements taken in that order: first P, then Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So if I measure P first, the state will collapse into an eigenstate of P, and then the measurement of Q will be based on that new state.

So the plan is: first, find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. Then, see what the state becomes after measuring P=0. Then, from that new state, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the probability that the initial state yields P=0 and then Q=-1. Another approach could be to see if the initial state can be expressed as a combination of the eigenstates of P, and then from there, find the probabilities.

Wait, but I should probably go step by step.

First, let's
