Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? Like, a spinor. So in Dirac notation, that would be a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. So the state vector ψ is [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: <S_y> = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. I remember that S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis, and for spin-½ particles like electrons, it's given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y.

Let me write down the σ_y matrix. Oh right, it's:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Now, the expectation value calculation would involve multiplying the bra vector (conjugate transpose of ψ) with S_y, then multiplying that by the ket vector (ψ).

So first, the bra vector ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. Since ψ is [3i;4], the conjugate makes the first component -3, because (3i)* is -3i? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? Because the complex conjugate changes i to -i.

Wait, wait. So ψ is a column vector:
ψ = [3i;
      4]

So ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*]. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 is real, so 4 becomes 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[0, -i;
i, 0]

So to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, I can write this as (ħ/2) times ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩.

Let me compute σ_y |ψ⟩ first. The matrix multiplication:

σ_y * ψ = [0*(-3i) + (-i)(4), ... Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the matrix is 2x2 and ψ is 2x1. So let me compute each component.

The top component of σ_y * ψ is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

The bottom component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y |ψ⟩ is [ -4i ; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], so when you multiply ψ† * σ_y |ψ⟩, it's the dot product of ψ† and σ_y |ψ⟩.

So that's (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).
