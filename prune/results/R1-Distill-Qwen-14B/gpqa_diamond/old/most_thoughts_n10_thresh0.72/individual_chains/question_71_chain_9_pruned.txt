Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, their periods are in these proportions. The planets are designated Planet_1 to Planet_5, and they all have the same albedo. The question is asking about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Oh right, that's the temperature a planet reaches when the energy it absorbs from the star equals the energy it radiates. The formula for equilibrium temperature usually involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since all planets have the same albedo here, that factor can be considered the same and might cancel out in the ratio.

The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * ( ( L / (16πσd²) )^(1/4) ), but maybe it's better to think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the further out, the cooler the planet.

Wait, the formula is T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - a) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( 1 / sqrt(d) ), where a is albedo, and d is the distance from the star. But since all planets have the same albedo (a is same for all), that part doesn't change. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star.

But wait, the orbital periods are given. How does orbital period relate to distance? Oh, Kepler's third law. The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P² ∝ d³. Thus, d ∝ P^(2/3).

So, for each planet, the distance from the star is proportional to the planet's period raised to the (2/3) power.

Since the planets are in resonance, their periods are in the given ratio. Let's list their periods:

Planet_1: 1 unit
Planet_2: 2 units
Planet_3:
