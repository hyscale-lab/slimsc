Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to find out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are all point groups, which classify the symmetry of molecules.

Let me break down the reactions described.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E.

Third reaction: C reacting with water gives back A plus two different acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H.

I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let's start with the first reaction.

So, A reacts with B in an 8:1 ratio. I'm thinking about possible solid compounds reacting with gases. Bright red product C suggests maybe something like copper(II) oxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur or another colored element.

Wait, another approach: when a solid metal reacts with a gas, maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with hydrogen? No, that's a gas. Or perhaps a metal reacting with a diatomic gas.

Wait, another thought: If product C is a red solid, maybe it's a transition metal compound. For example, CuO is black, but Cu2O is reddish. So maybe A is copper metal, B is sulfur gas (S8), and C is Cu2S. But wait, let's see.

Wait, in the third reaction, when C reacts with water, it forms A and two acids. If C is Cu2S, then reacting with water might not produce acids, unless it's in acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide reacting with water to form a metal oxide and H2S. Hmm, but H2S is a weak acid, and maybe another acid?

Wait, let's consider another approach. Let's think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with water might not produce strong acid. Wait, unless it's reacting under certain conditions. Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, maybe reacting with water to form a strong acid? For example, if C is Na2O, reacting with water gives NaOH (strong base, not acid) but that's not fitting.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal sulfide. When metal sulfides react with water, especially in acidic conditions, they can produce H2S gas (which is a weak acid), and the corresponding metal hydroxide, which may not be an acid. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or something else.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a compound like phosgene or something else. Or perhaps something like ozone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the fourth reaction: D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, D + B → H. Let's think about common solvents. Maybe H is something like ethanol or something else. Wait, if B is a gas, perhaps H is a common solvent like H2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if B is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Wait, but if B is Cl2, and D is H2O, then perhaps H is HCl? But that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like Cl2 or O2. Let me try to piece this together.

Let's try to assign possible chemicals.

First reaction: A is a solid. It reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C.

If B is Cl2, perhaps A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions to form AlCl3. But the product would be AlCl3, which is white, not bright red. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: The bright red product. Could it be something like FeS, but I think FeS is black. Wait, Fe3O4 is black too. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Sulfur itself is bright yellow, but when it's in a compound? Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide of another metal.

Wait, think about the reaction with water. If C reacts with water to form A and two acids. Suppose C is a sulfide like FeS. Then reacting with water would produce Fe(OH)2 (which is not an acid), but perhaps in acidic conditions, it would produce H2S and Fe^3+ ions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate? Like CaSO3 or something. No, those are usually white or another color.

Alternatively,
