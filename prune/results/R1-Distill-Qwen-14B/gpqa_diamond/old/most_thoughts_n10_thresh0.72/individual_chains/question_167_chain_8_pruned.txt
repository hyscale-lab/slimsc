Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian operations alone, which are easier to handle. So the question gives me the state and some formulas, and I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) for specific parameters.

The state is |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N, where N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

The relative entropy measure is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state. So I think this is the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and the Gaussian reference state.

Wait, but how do I calculate this? I remember that for pure states, the density matrix rho is just |psi><psi|. But tau is a Gaussian state. I'm a bit fuzzy on what the reference Gaussian state would be. Oh, wait, in some cases, the reference Gaussian state might be the thermal state or some other Gaussian state that's the closest to the given state. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the separable Gaussian state closest to the non-Gaussian state. Or perhaps it's the cat state itself when it's Gaussian, but in this case, the cat state is non-Gaussian unless phi is zero or something. Wait, the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which generally makes it non-Gaussian. But when phi is zero, it's just a single coherent state, which is Gaussian.

Wait, but the problem gives phi as -pi/4. Let's compute sin(2*phi) for that. 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. So the N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Let's compute that. alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. 2*alpha² is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065. So 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is ( cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is zero because rho is idempotent, right? Wait no, wait. The von Neumann entropy is -Tr(rho log rho). But for a pure state, rho is a projector, so rho^2 = rho. Then log(rho) would be 0 when rho is |psi><psi|, because rho^k = rho for any k >=1. So Tr(rho ln rho) would be Tr(0) = 0? Wait, no, because ln(rho) is ln(rho) where rho is a projector. Let me think. For a pure state, rho is a rank-1 projector. So the logarithm of rho would be ln(rho) = ln( |psi><psi| ). But |psi><psi| is a projection operator, and for a rank-1 operator, ln(rho) is only defined if rho is a positive matrix, which it is, but the logarithm of a rank-1 matrix isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the entropy terms are zero because for a pure state, rho ln rho is zero? Because rho is idempotent, so rho ln rho would be ln(rho) applied to rho. But I might be getting stuck here.

Wait, but what's the entropy of a pure state? For a pure state, rho is |psi><psi|, so its eigenvalues are 1 (once) and 0 otherwise. The von Neumann entropy is -sum lambda_i ln lambda_i, which here is just -1 * ln(1) = 0. So the entropy S(rho) is zero. But wait, the relative entropy is between rho and tau, which is a Gaussian state. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). But S(rho) is zero, so del_b would be - S(tau)? Or wait, no, the formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. For rho being pure, trace(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b is minus trace(tau ln tau). Wait, but relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). Oh wait, the problem states it's [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is not the standard relative entropy. That's a bit confusing. Because usually, relative entropy is S(rho||tau) = S(rho) + S(rho|tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But here, the formula is different. So in this case, del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), since S(rho) is Tr(rho ln rho) and S(tau) is Tr(tau ln tau).

Wait, but for the given rho, it's a pure state, so S(rho) is zero. So del_b would be - S(tau). So nG would be - S(tau). But that can't be right because non-Gaussianity is usually a positive quantity. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me read the question again.

The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So in this case, rho is the non-Gaussian state, tau is the
