Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet is bigger, 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have so that both transit and occultation events are observed.

Hmm, transit and occultation. I remember that transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we stop seeing its reflected light, I think. For both to happen, the planets must be aligned in such a way that their orbital periods allow them to be in the right positions for both events to occur.

Wait, but wait. If they're in the same orbital plane and both transiting, maybe they're in a resonant or a specific orbital configuration. Like, maybe they're in a chain where one is overtaking the other, but not sure.

Wait no, the key here is that for a second planet to transit and be occulted, it must have an orbital period that is either longer or shorter than the first. But the problem is asking for the maximum orbital period. So the longer period planet would have a slower orbit.

But wait, for both transit and occultation events to occur, the two planets must be in a situation where the second planet can pass in front of the star (transit) and the first planet can pass behind the star (occultation of the first by the star, but wait, occultation is when the planet is behind the star from our view. So for the second planet to cause the first to be occulted, the second would have to be moving in a way that it's behind the star, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the orbital periods and the conditions required for both to transit and occult each other. Wait, no, occultation is when one is behind the star, which might be a separate situation.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the second planet being able to transit (so it must be closer to the star than the first planet, because it's bigger) or maybe farther, depending on the star's size.

Wait, let me think again
