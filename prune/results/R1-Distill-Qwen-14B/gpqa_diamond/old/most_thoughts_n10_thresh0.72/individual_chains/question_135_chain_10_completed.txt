Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about boson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the bosonic field X has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not sure about the notation here. Oh right, I think the λ is the coupling constant, f represents different fermion flavors, and X is the boson field. So the interaction term is between the boson X and fermions.

Now, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which pairs of fermions X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in the rest frame of the boson, the fermions must have enough energy to be created.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of the known fermions to see which ones are possible.

Quarks:
- Up and down: very light, maybe a few MeV. So 2m_u or 2m_d would be way less than 6 GeV. So possible.

Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV each. So 2*1.5 = 3 GeV. 3 < 6, so possible.

Strange quark: around 100 MeV, wait wait, no, wait. I think strange quarks are heavier. Wait, I might be mixing up. Let me think. Up and down are light, charm is ~1.5 GeV, strange is maybe around ~100 MeV? Or wait, no, I'm wrong. I think strange quarks are actually around ~100 MeV as well, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing with the mass of the K meson. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the strange quark is around ~50-100 MeV? Wait no, that can't be. Because heavier quarks have higher masses. Let me think again. Wait, in reality, the masses are:

Up: ~2 MeV
Down: ~4 MeV (approx)
Strange: ~100 MeV (approx)
Charm: ~1.5 GeV
Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
Top: ~173 GeV

Wait, so strange is around 100 MeV. So 2m_s would be 200 MeV, which is 0.2 GeV. So 0.2 GeV is way less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into s sbar.

Similarly, for bottom quarks: each is about 4.5 GeV. 2*4.5 =9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. Because 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV, so it's not allowed. So any option that includes b bbar would be wrong. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A includes b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option C includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D includes b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So since X can't decay into b bbar, options A and D are out.

Now, what about the other fermions? Let's look at leptons.

Electron: mass ~0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e ~0.001 GeV. Well below 6 GeV. So possible.

Muon: about 0.1 GeV. 2m_mu ~0.2 GeV, which is fine.

Tau lepton: about 1.77 GeV each. 2*1.77 =3.54 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV? Wait, 3.54 is less than 6, so yes. So tau pairs are allowed.

What about the top quark? Oh, but top is way too heavy. Each top is 173 GeV. 2m_t is 346 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. So no t tbar decay. So options with t tbar in decays are invalid. So option C includes t tbar, which is impossible. So option C is out.

Now, what about the charm quark? Each is 1.5 GeV. So 3 GeV total. So 6 GeV is more than enough. So c cbar is allowed.

So looking at the options left: options B and C. Wait, no, C is out because it includes top.

So between B and the others. Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that's all the possible decays.

Wait, what about the bottom quark? Because I thought that X can't decay into b bbar. So the possible fermions are up, down, strange, charm, electron, muon, tau.

Wait, but also, wait, in the Lagrangian, what fermions are involved? The Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So f is an index for the fermion species, perhaps. So which fermions are allowed in the interaction?

Assuming that the interaction is with all fermions, because the problem doesn't limit it. So the decay can be to any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass allows.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, in the Standard Model, certain particles may not interact via a particular force. But in this problem, the Lagrangian is given as a general interaction, so I think X can decay into any fermion pair, provided kinematics allow it.

So, the possible fermion pairs are those where 2m_f < 6 GeV.

Which are:

u: 2m_u ~ 0.008 GeV (since m_u ~2 MeV, 2m_u ~4 MeV). So X can decay into u ubar.

d: similar, 2m_d is about 8 MeV. So yes.

s: 2m_s ~ 0.2 GeV, so yes.

c: 3 GeV. Yes.

e: 2m_e ~0.001 GeV, yes.

mu: 0.2 GeV, yes.

tau: 3.54 GeV, yes.

But not b (9 GeV), because 6 <9.

What about the bottom quark? So in the options, only options A and D include b bbar, which are invalid. So the correct decays are all except b bbar and top quark.

So looking at the options, option B is:

X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Which includes all the allowed fermions except b and top.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermions. So the answer is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair. The fermion masses are as follows:

- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_u \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \), which is much less than 6 GeV.
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_d \sim 8 \, \text{MeV} \), which is also much less than 6 GeV.
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_s \sim 200 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV.
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c \sim 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV.
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_b \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which is greater than 6 GeV, making \( b\bar{b} \) decay impossible.
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which is far greater than 6 GeV, making \( t\bar{t} \) decay impossible.
- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_e \sim 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \), which is much less than 6 GeV.
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu \sim 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV.
- Tau lepton (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.54 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV.

From this analysis, the allowed decays of \( X \) are into pairs of \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( c\bar{c} \), \( e^+e^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( \tau^+\tau^- \). Decays into \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \) are kinematically forbidden because their masses exceed 6 GeV.

Now, evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Hence, this is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. This is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Hence, this is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Hence, this is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
