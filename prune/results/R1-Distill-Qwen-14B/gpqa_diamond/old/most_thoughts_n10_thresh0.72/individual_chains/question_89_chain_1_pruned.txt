Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, I need to figure out what each step does and then find the structure of product 3 to determine the NMR signals.

Let me break it down step by step.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. So this should be dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the positions are such that elimination forms a double bond between 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Or perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused. The 1,3-dibromo would be on two non-adjacent carbons? Or are they adjacent in the structure? Maybe I should sketch it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But KOH in such a case would usually lead to elimination, especially with vicinal dihalides. So, product 1 is likely an alkene.

Wait, but wait! Another possibility: in some cases, when a dihalide reacts with a strong base, it can form an epoxide. But I think that's when it's a vicinal dihalide and the base is something else, like NaOH under certain conditions. Or maybe it's more about the structure.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. The product 1 has an IR absorption at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong indication of a carbonyl group (C=O). So, product 1 is an epoxide? Or maybe a ketone or ester?

Wait, no, if it's elimination, we'd get an alkene. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but then the product would be an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Unless it's a different reaction. Oh wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH in a substitution reaction to form a diol. Because KOH can act as a base or a nucleophile. For vicinal dihalides, treatment with aqueous KOH would typically produce a diol via SN2 substitution.

Wait, but that would give a 1,3-diol. But the NMR data for product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a quartet? Or maybe a doublet, but the integration is 2H. The other peaks are in the 2-2.5 ppm region, which are typical for CH2 or CH groups in alkanes or adamantane derivatives.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol (1,3-diol), then the OH groups would appear in the NMR. But in the given NMR, there's no broad peak around 1-5 ppm, which suggests no OH protons, so maybe the diol is not present. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is protonated or exchanged, but in D2O maybe? Or perhaps the diol is not present because the reaction went another way.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have a characteristic strain and their own NMR signals, but the IR at 1720 cm^-1 is more like a carbonyl, not an epoxide. Wait, epoxides have a C-O-C bond, but their carbonyl (if any?) isn't present. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. The IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a carbonyl. So if that's the case
