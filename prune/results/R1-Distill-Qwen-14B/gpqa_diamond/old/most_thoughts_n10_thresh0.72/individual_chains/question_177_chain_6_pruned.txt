Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key points given are:

1. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 R2.
2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 M2.
3. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest (their peak wavelengths) are the same. Hmm, that's interesting.
4. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. But wait, I'm not sure how this affects the luminosity yet. Maybe it's a redshift or blueshift consideration? Or perhaps it's about Doppler effect influencing observed brightness?
5. The question asks by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Alright, the question is about luminosity, so I should recall the formula for luminosity of a star. I remember that the luminosity of a star (L) is related to its radius (R), temperature (T), and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, since both stars are black bodies, their luminosities depend on R² and T⁴. The problem gives R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1 squared is (1.5)^2 times R2 squared, which is 2.25 times. But we also need to account for the temperature difference.

The next thing is the peak wavelengths. Both stars have the same peak wavelengths. Wait, from what I remember, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). So, if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So, T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, no, wait. Because the radial velocities are different. Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. Star_1 has zero radial velocity. So, does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh right! Because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength would be different if the star is moving relative to us.

So, in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Since the velocity is non-zero, its observed wavelength would be Doppler shifted. But the question says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, their observed (shifted) λ_max are the same.

Hmm, okay, that complicates things. Because the intrinsic temperature is different from the observed temperature due to Doppler shift. So, the observed peak wavelength λ_obs is the same for both. But their actual temperatures (T_intrinsic) might be different because of their velocities.

So, let's think about this. For Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, the observed wavelength is the same as the intrinsic wavelength. So, λ1_obs = λ1_intrinsic. For Star_2, because it's moving, the observed wavelength is different.

Wait, but the question states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, for Star_2, the observed λ_max (λ2_obs) is the same as Star_1's λ_max. But Star_2's intrinsic λ_max would be different due to the Doppler shift.

Wait, but how does the Doppler shift affect the observed wavelength? The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, I think I might have the sign wrong. If the object is moving away (v_r positive), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If it's moving towards (v_r negative), the wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).

So, Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. But the question doesn't specify direction, just that the radial velocity is 700. Let's assume it's moving away, so v_r is positive. Then λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait no, wait. Let me get the Doppler formula right. The relativistic Doppler shift formula when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But wait, if the source is moving away, v is positive, so the denominator is (1 - v/c), which is less than 1, so sqrt of that is less than 1, and the numerator is 1 + v/c, so sqrt of that is greater than 1. So, λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

But since v is 700 km/s, we can compute v/c. Let's compute that. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 is approximately 0.002333... So, 0.233% of the speed of light.

So, let's compute the Doppler shift factor. Let me compute (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) first.

(1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) = (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.00468.

Taking the square root of this, sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234.

So, the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * 1.00234.

But wait, in this case, Star_2's observed λ_max is the same as Star_1's. So, for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_obs1.

Star_1 doesn't have any Doppler shift because its radial velocity is zero. So, λ_obs1 = λ1_rest.

Star_2 has λ_obs2 = λ2_rest * 1.00234.

But
