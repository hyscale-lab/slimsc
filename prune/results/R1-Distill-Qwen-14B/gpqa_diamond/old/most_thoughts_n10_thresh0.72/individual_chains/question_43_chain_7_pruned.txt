Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I remember that IUPAC nomenclature for such compounds is based on the substituents' positions relative to the main functional group. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group), and a cyano group, all meta to each other. That means each of these three groups is in positions that are separated by one carbon, right? Because meta means they're three positions apart on the ring.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Actually, in a benzene ring, each substituent being meta to another would be two positions apart. Because the numbering starts at one substituent, and then the next is two carbons away. For example, if the first substituent is at position 1, the next meta would be at position 3, and the third would be at position 5. So the three groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5, but waitâ€”no, if they're all meta to each other, then each pair is meta. That would require the three substituents to form a sort of triangle, but wait, that's only possible if they're at 1, 3, and 5 positions, I think. Because in a benzene ring, each meta position is two apart from each other.

So the three groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are at positions 1, 3, and 5. But wait, the problem says all meta to one another. So, perhaps the main functional group is the carboxylic acid, which is the highest priority, so that's the reference point.

Wait, the main functional group in the IUPAC name is the carboxylic acid, because it has the highest priority. So the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, the other groups are numbered relative to that.

Now, the substituents:

- The carboxylic acid is the main group, so position 1.
- The carbaldehyde (formyl group) is meta to the carboxylic acid. So that's position 3 or 5? Because if it's meta, it's two positions away from position 1. So in a benzene ring, position 1 has the COOH, then the next substituent meta would be position 3 or 5. Wait, but the problem says all three are meta to each other. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the problem states: "A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another." So each of these is meta to the others. That implies that each substituent is positioned two carbons away from the others. So, placing them at positions 1, 3, and 5. Because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are meta. Wait, no, 5 and 1 would be para to each other, not meta. Because in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are meta, 1 and 4 are para.
