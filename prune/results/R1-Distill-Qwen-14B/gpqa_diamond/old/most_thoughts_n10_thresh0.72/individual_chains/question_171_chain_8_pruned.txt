Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that these reactions typically happen on aromatic rings, right? The question is about the substitution of bromine, and each of the given substances (1-6) has a different substituent attached to the benzene ring. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. 

Wait, weight fraction of para-isomer... that means for each compound, when bromine adds, how much of the product is the para-substituted version? The one with the lowest weight fraction of para would be the first in the order, and the highest would be last. 

So, I think the key here is understanding the directing effects of each substituent. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming electrophiles to ortho, meta, or para positions.

Let me list each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Methyl is a strong activating group, so it's ortho/para-directing. 

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a phenyl ester group, specifically a ethoxycarbonyl group (like a COOEt). Wait, the substituent is COOEt, which is an ester. Esters are electron-withdrawing groups because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So they are meta directors. But wait, esters are deactivating but ortho/para directors? No, wait. No, deactivating groups are meta directors. Because activating groups are ortho/para, deactivating (like nitro groups) are meta. So COOEt is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is attached to the benzene ring. Chlorine is a halogen; it's an interesting case. It's an electron-withdrawing group due to its electronegativity, but the lone pairs can donate some electrons through resonance. So chlorine is a deactivating (because it's more electronegative) but ortho/para-directing. Because although it's electron-withdrawing, the lone pairs can activate the ring in the ortho and para positions. So Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para director.

4) C6H5-NO2: That's a nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating group because it's a strong electron-withdrawing group. It is meta-directing. So when nitro is present, the incoming electrophile will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So the para isomer would be less favored here.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethyl group attached to benzene. Similar to methyl, ethyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So it's electron-donating, activating, and directs to ortho and para.

6) C6H5-COOH: That's a carboxylic acid group (COOH). Carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl and the -OH (which is also EWG). So, this is meta-directing. So, the substituent will direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. 

So, the substituents and their directing effects:

1) Methyl: activating, o/p
2) COOEt: deact, meta
3) Cl: deact, o/p
4) NO2: deact, meta
5) Ethyl: activating, o/p
6) COOH: deact, meta

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The more activating the group, the more the ring is activated, so substitution is more favored in the positions directed. Also, for deactivating groups, the ring is less reactive, so the para product may not be as favored.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for activating groups (like methyl, ethyl), the para isomer would be a significant product. Whereas for deactivating groups, especially meta-directing, the para might be less.

But wait, what about the substituents that are deactivating but o/p-directing, like Cl. So when Cl is present, the ring is less reactive, but the incoming electrophile is directed to para. So whether the fraction of para is high or low depends on the competition between the substituents and their directing effects.

Wait, but for each substituent, the substituent directs where the incoming electrophile goes. So for a meta director like NO2, the product would be meta.
