Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving a reaction. I need to figure out the major products for each and then choose the correct option from the given choices.

Let's start with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong base, so maybe it's promoting some kind of elimination or addition reaction. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Oh, right! When a ketone reacts with an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound in the presence of a base, it's probably a Michael addition or a conjugate addition. No, wait, Michael addition is when a nucleophile adds to the beta position. Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton, maybe it's an enolate forming.

Wait, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So, the structure is like a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, methyl groups at C2 and C6, and ethyl at C2 as well.

When ethyl acrylate is present, which is CH2=CHCOOEt, the base (t-BuOK) might deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate can then attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester in a conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexanone is undergoing enolate formation, and the ethyl acrylate is the Michael acceptor.

Wait, but wait, the cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The more substituted the enolate, the more stable it is. So the base will deprotonate the alpha hydrogen. The possible alpha positions are adjacent to the carbonyl. In this case, the ketone is at C1, so the alpha carbons are C2 and C6.

Wait, C2 has an eth
