Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has Earth's radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of this planet is 3 days. We need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 times Earth's radius, such that both transit and occultation events occur.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit its star from our point of view, the orbit must be edge-on, so the impact parameter has to be zero. Wait, but here the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. Oh wait, wait, impact parameter refers to the distance from the center of the star during transit, measured in units of the star's radius. So a higher impact parameter means the planet doesn't pass directly in front of the star's center.

Wait, but in the problem, the first planet has a transit, so I guess it's transiting regardless of the impact parameter. But the second planet needs to also transit. But the question is about the maximum period so that both transit and occultation happen. Oh, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star from our view, which also requires the orbit to be edge-on, I think. So for both events, the planet must pass in front and behind the star, which implies the same orbital plane and alignment.

Wait, but the first planet is in a circular orbit, and the second also shares the same orbital plane. So their orbital planes are aligned. Oh, but their orbital periods are different, so they won't necessarily always transit each other, but for the second planet to transit and be occulted as well, they must be in some kind of resonant or aligned orbit.

Wait, but I think the key here is the timing of their orbits. The second planet must have an orbital period that allows for mutual transits and occultations. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the Hill sphere or something else? Or perhaps it's about the synodic period.

Wait, another approach: The two planets must be in a configuration where, as seen from Earth
