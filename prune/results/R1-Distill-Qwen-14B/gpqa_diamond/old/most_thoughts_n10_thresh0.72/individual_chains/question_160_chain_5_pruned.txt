Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength lambda is coming along the z-axis and hits the aperture vertically. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can approximate tan(theta) as theta.

The options are A to D, with various lambda over a multiplied by numbers like 0.610, 0.500, etc. Hmm.

Okay, so I remember that when dealing with diffraction patterns, the structure of the aperture determines the pattern observed. For a circular aperture, we have the Airy disk with the first minimum at a certain angle. But this is a polygon with a very large N, so it's almost like a circular aperture but with more sides. Wait, but wait, perhaps it's more like a regular polygon with a large N approaching infinity, so it's effectively a circle. But wait, I'm not so sure. Because the problem is referring to a polygonal aperture, maybe it's different from a circular one.

Wait, no. If N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. So perhaps the angular distance between the first two minima would be the same as that of a circular aperture, which is the first dark ring at theta = 1.22 lambda/(diameter). Wait, the diameter of the circular aperture would be 2a, because the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? Because for a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon, the radius (distance from center to a vertex) is longer than the apothem. But wait, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem because the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, which in the limit becomes the same as the radius of the circle.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius (R) is the distance from the center to a vertex
