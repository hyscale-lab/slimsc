Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Let me see what I can figure out.

First, the FTIR part. The problem says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So combining these, it seems like the compound has a carboxylic acid group because they have both O-H (broad) and C=O (sharp) in their IR spectra.

So the compound is likely a carboxylic acid. Now, looking at the options, all of them end with COOH, except maybe I should check. Wait, no, all options have COOH at the end. So each option is a substituted pentanoic acid or something similar.

Next, the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, meaning there are no double bonds because vinyl protons are usually in the range around 4.5-7 ppm and have specific splitting patterns due to coupling. But in this case, since there are no vinyl peaks, all the hydrogens are either on single bonds or in other environments.

Now, looking at the specific NMR signals. There's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, complex splitting patterns. Those usually happen when a proton is next to multiple sets of neighboring protons. For example, if a CH has neighboring groups with more than one set of protons, each coupling with it.

Wait, let's think about the structures. Each option is a substituted butanoic acid or similar. Let me write them out.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like CH2CH2 where each C has two substituents. Wait, perhaps it's like this: the main chain is CH2CH2, but each of the middle carbons has substituents. Let me try to parse the formula correctly.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structures mentally. Let's see:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So that's like (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-COOH. Wait no, perhaps the backbone is longer. Alternatively, maybe it's more like:

Each "C(H)(...)" is a carbon attached to a hydrogen and another group. So for option A, it's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central two carbons each have
