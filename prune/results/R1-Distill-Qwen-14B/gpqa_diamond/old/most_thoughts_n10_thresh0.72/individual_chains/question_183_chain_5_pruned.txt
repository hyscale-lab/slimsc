Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, I remember the index of hydrogen deficiency is related to the degrees of unsaturation in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond as two, I think.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. I should probably draw its structure to visualize it better. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. Let me imagine the cyclohexene ring. The position is 3, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, maybe? No, wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, because numbering starts such that the double bond gets the lowest possible number. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So carbons 3 and 4 are double-bonded. Then, the substituents: 2-formyl and 5-vinyl. So, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached. So, position 5 has a CH2CH2 with a double bond? Or is it CH2CH2 as a substituent? Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is at position 5, so that would be a CH2-CH2? No, no, the substituent is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, no. The substituent is a vinyl group, meaning CH2=CH- attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. So, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group (
