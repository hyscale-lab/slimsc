Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as mu = γ * S_z. Wait, no, wait—that's probably mu = γ multiplied by the spin component in the z-direction. But wait, S_z is the spin operator, right? So mu is proportional to the spin. Got it.

The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with B. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So before the switch, the system was in an eigenstate of S_z because the magnetic field was along Z. When B is turned off, the Hamiltonian changes, right?

Wait, but when B is turned off, the magnetic field is zero, so the Hamiltonian would be zero, assuming it's H = -μ·B. But then they turn on another field along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H' = -μ·B', where B' is along Y. So H' becomes proportional to S_y, because mu is γ S_z, but wait, no— wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as mu = γ * S_z. Wait, that's only the z-component of mu. But when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B, so for B along Y, it's mu_y multiplied by B. But wait, mu is given as mu = γ S_z, which is only the z-component. Hmm, wait, that might be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the magnetic moment is μ = γ S, so that it's a vector. Then, when B is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B = -γ B S_z. But when B is turned off, the Hamiltonian is zero. Then, when the field is turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H' = -μ · B_y = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but the initial state was an eigenstate of S_z. Let me see. So before the field change, the state was |+z> or |-z>, since the field was along Z. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero, so the state doesn't change immediately. But then
