Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's read it carefully.

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. So, a benzene ring (which is 6 carbons), plus two substituents. Wait, but wait, the total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so each substituent must add up to 2 more carbons. Or maybe one substituent has 2 carbons and the other has zero? No, wait, it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. So each substituent contributes to the total.

Hmm, the FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So, two substituents on the benzene ring: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the substituents can be in different positions. Di-substituted, so the two groups are either para, meta, or ortho to each other.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures.

So the ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else), and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I, but probably Cl or Br since those are common).

Wait, but the ring is a six-membered aromatic ring, so benzene with two substituents. Let me think about the possible substituent groups.

Wait, but I have to make sure that the total number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents must add 2 carbons. So each substituent would add one carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is a -CO- group, which might have more carbons.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me count. The compound has 8 carbons in total. So, benzene (6 C) plus substituents.

So substituent 1 and substituent 2 must account for 2 C. So each substituent contributes one C (since 1 + 1 = 2). Or perhaps one substituent is
