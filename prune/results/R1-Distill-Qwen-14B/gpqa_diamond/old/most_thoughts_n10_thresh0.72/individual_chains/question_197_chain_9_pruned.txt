Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different structure.

First, I should look at the spectral data provided for Compound X: the IR and the 1H NMR.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since we're dealing with organic compounds, it's more likely an O-H stretch, possibly from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, but those are usually around 10-12 ppm and as a broad peak. However, a broad peak at 10.5 could also be an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Hmm. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange with D2O, but in the NMR, if it's a broad singlet, perhaps it's a -COOH proton. Because aldehyde protons are more upfield.

Wait, but the next peak is at 8.0 ppm, which is a doublet (d) integrating for 2H. Then 7.2 ppm, another doublet for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para-substituted rings, the protons are split into two doublets each integrating to 2H. For example, if the benzene has two substituents in para positions, like a carbonyl group and another group.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is probably not an aldehyde. Because aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm and can be sharp, but in this case, it's a broad singlet, which might be more consistent with a carboxylic acid. Oh, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would show up as a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid. Let me think about that.

But let me look further. The next peak is at 2.9 ppm, a multiplet integrating for 1H. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

So, the 0.9 ppm triplet with 3H suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain, like a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H looks like a methylene group adjacent to a methyl (maybe CH(CH2CH3) something). Or wait, a doublet for 3H—wait, but that's probably a CH3 group attached to something else. Like a CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think: The 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which is commonly seen as a CH3 group attached to a CH that's next to something else. For example, in an isobutyl group.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm multiplet with 2H could be a CH2 group between two different environments. So maybe it's part of a
