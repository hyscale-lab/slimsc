Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. My job is to pick the correct starting materials A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that when you treat certain compounds with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it's often related to diazotization reactions, maybe something with amines or perhaps something else. Oh wait, another possibility is the formation of oximes from ketones, but that usually involves hydroxylamine. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the production of carbonyl groups from some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, another thought: I've heard about the Hock rearrangement, which involves the treatment of certain substrates with nitrous acid (from NaNO2 and HCl) under aqueous conditions. The Hock rearrangement typically converts a ketone with adjacent hydroxyl groups into a diketone. Or wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyclic intermediate, like a hydrate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think about the formation of beta-keto acids or similar structures. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, the products are diketones. So each of the starting materials, when treated with these reagents, produces a compound with two ketone groups. Let's think about how that could happen.

One scenario is the oxidation of alcohols to ketones. But wait, oxidation usually requires oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or CrO3, not HCl and NaNO2. So that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: the treatment could be leading to the elimination of certain groups, generating ketones. For example, if the starting material is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a leaving group, maybe in an elimination reaction? But I'm not sure what would form two ketones from that.

Wait, another approach: the reagents HCl, NaNO2, and H2O are often used in the production of nitrous acid, which can react with amines or other functional groups. But if the starting materials aren't amines, then maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the formation of a geminal diol from a ketone. Wait no, that usually requires something like hydrob
