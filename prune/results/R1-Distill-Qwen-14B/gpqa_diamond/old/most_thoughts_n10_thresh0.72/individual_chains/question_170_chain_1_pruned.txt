Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means it's a two-component vector. So I guess the state vector is [3i, 4] in some basis, probably the eigenbasis of S_z or something. But I'm not entirely certain about the basis here.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator. In this case, we're looking for the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin along the y-axis. I remember that the spin operator S_y for a spin-½ particle is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix. Oh wait, the note in the problem gives the sigma_y matrix as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ would be the expectation of sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Since the problem asks for S_y, I can compute sigma_y's expectation first and then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write down the state vector ψ. It's a column vector [3i; 4], right? So ψ = [3i; 4]^T. Wait, but wait, the state vector in quantum mechanics is usually a column vector, but sometimes it's written as a row. Oh, but here the notation is (3i, 4), so probably a row vector. Hmm, but when computing the expectation value, I think the bra is the conjugate transpose. So I'll proceed accordingly.

The expectation value of sigma_y is ⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩.

So first, let me compute sigma_y multiplied by the state vector |ψ⟩.

Wait, sigma_y is a 2x2 matrix. Let's compute sigma_y * |ψ⟩.

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let's do the matrix multiplication.

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i²
