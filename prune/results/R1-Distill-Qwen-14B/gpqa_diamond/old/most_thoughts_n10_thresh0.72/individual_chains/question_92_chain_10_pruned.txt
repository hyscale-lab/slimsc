Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a pretty complex organic molecule. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to remember what the enthalpy of formation is. Oh right, it's the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I need to figure out how many of each type of bond are formed and broken when this molecule is made from carbon and hydrogen.

The problem gives me the bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. That's the energy needed to break a C-C bond into two carbon atoms, right? So the bond energy for C-C is 200 kJ/mol. Wait, no wait. Oh, I think I might have that reversed. The bond energy is the energy released when the bond forms. So if it takes 200 kJ/mol to break a C-C bond, then the bond energy (the energy released when the bond forms) is 200 kJ/mol. Or wait, maybe I have it the other way around. Let me think. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of the substance into atoms. So for carbon, that would be if it's in a solid or something. But I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should just proceed and see.

The molecule is a hydrocarbon with several double bonds and branching. Let me count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me draw this out mentally. So starting from the left: 

- There's a (CH3)2C=CH group. So that's a C with two CH3 groups attached, double bonded to CH. Then a CH2, followed by CH(CH3), another CH2, then a CH which is double bonded to C(CH3)2.

So each of the double bonds is a C=C. Let me count the number of C=C bonds. I see two double bonds: one on the left part and another on the right part. So two C=C bonds.

Now, the single bonds. Let's count the number of C-C, C-H, and H-H bonds.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question provides bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. So I need to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule and compare that to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the enthalpy of formation calculation typically involves the bonds in the reactants (elements) and the bonds formed in the product. So the formula is:

Enthalpy of formation = [sum of bond energies in reactants] - [sum of bond energies in products]

Wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? I think it's the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants minus the energy released when forming the bonds in the product. So, enthalpy of reaction is (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed). Wait no, wait. When bonds are broken, you have to put in energy (endothermic), and when bonds are formed, you release energy (exothermic). So for the formation, the molecule is being formed from its elements. So the process would be:

Elements (in standard states) â†’ Molecule.

So the bonds in the elements (like H2 and C) need to be broken, and new bonds in the molecule are formed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon like this, the elements would be H2 and C (graphite or something, but maybe they're using the atomization approach here).

Wait, the problem gives the "enthalpy of atomization of carbon" as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm. So for each carbon atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol to break it into an atom. But wait, that doesn't sound right because carbon in a solid (like graphite) has C-C bonds. So the atomization would break C-C bonds into C atoms. So if the bond energy of C-C is 200 kJ/mol, then breaking a mole of C-C bonds would require 200 kJ. But the problem says the atomization enthalpy is 1000 kJ/mol. So perhaps the question is treating each C atom as being in its atomic form, meaning that each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to form. Wait, but that can't be right because, for example, in
