Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that the pion is at rest, and it's a charged pion, Pi(+), which decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they produce other particles. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options given are A, B, C, D with different values for the kinetic energies.

The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos are very light, but in these particle physics problems, sometimes we assume their rest mass is negligible compared to the others. So maybe the neutrino's mass is zero for this calculation. That simplifies things a bit.

So, the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and neutrino after decay must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its momentum will be approximately equal to that of the muon, but opposite.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here. The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, wait. The energy and momentum must both be conserved. So let me set up the equations.

Let me denote:
m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
m_nu ≈ 0 (since it's a neutrino)

Let me denote the energies of muon and neutrino as E_mu and E_nu, respectively. The momenta as p_mu and p_nu. Since momentum is conserved, the vectors must add to zero. So p_mu = -p_nu, which means their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is E_nu = p c. For the muon, its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, wait. Energy for a particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? No, wait, E is in units of MeV. So let me get the units right. Let me think in units where c=1. That's probably easier. So in natural units, c=1, so E = sqrt(p² + m²).

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. The initial energy is m_pi, since the pion is at rest. So:

m_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

And the momentum conservation gives p_mu = p_nu, but opposite in direction. So their magnitudes are equal. So:

p_mu = p_nu = p.

But since neutrino is massless, E_nu = p.

So substituting E_nu = p into the energy equation:

m_pi = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) + p.

Let me write this as:

m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

m_pi - p = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

Then, square both sides:

(m_pi - p)^2 = p² + m_mu².

Expanding the left side:

m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p² = p² + m_mu².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_pi² - 2 m_pi p = m_mu².

Then,

-2 m_pi p = m_mu² - m_pi².

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So,

p = (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi).

Wait, I think that's right. Let me compute m_pi² and m_mu² first.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So, m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 = let's calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is a bit less. Let me compute 139.6 *139.6.

139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 gives 19488.16. So approximately 19488.16 (MeV)^2.

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2.

Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and the cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 10000+1140=11140 +32.49=11172.49.

So, m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then, 2 m_pi = 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2. Let's compute that.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2 ≈ Let me see, 279.2 * 30 is 8376. So 30 gives 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So 30 * 279.2 is 8376. So 8315.67 is 8376 - 60.33. So 30 - (60.33/279.2). 60.33/279.2 ≈ 0.216. So p ≈ 29.784. Let me compute precisely.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.784 = let's see, 279.2 *30=8376. 279.2 *0.216= approx 279.2 *0.2=55.84, 0.016 is 4.4672. So 55.84+4.4672=60.3072. So 8376 - 60.3072=8315.6928. Close enough. So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, that's for p in units where c=1. So in MeV/c? Or is it in MeV? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of units.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, so momentum p has units MeV/c. But when we calculate p, it's in MeV/c. Because in E = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4), but if c=1, then E = sqrt(p² + m²), with p in MeV/c, m in MeV/c². But perhaps I should think in terms of units correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that in natural units, c=1, and E is in MeV, p is in MeV/c, m is in MeV/c².

But in any case, the value of p is approximately 29.784 MeV/c.

So, E_nu = p c, but since c=1, E_nu = p = ~29.784 MeV.

Then, E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.784^2: approx 29.78^2= about 887.

Wait, 30^2=900, so 29.784^2 is (30 - 0.216)^2=900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2=900 -12.96 + 0.046656= approx 887.086656.

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2=11172.49.

So adding 887.086656 +11172.49=12059.576656.

The square root of 12059.576 is approx sqrt(12059.576). Let's think: 110^2=12100, which is a bit higher. So 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059.576) is about 109.81, since 109.8^2= (110-0.2)^2=12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04. Which is a bit less than 12059.576. So let me compute 109.8^2=12056.04. Then, 109.81^2: (109.8 + 0.01)^2=109.8^2 + 2*109.8*0.01 + 0.01^2= 12056.04 + 2.196 +0.0001≈12058.2361. Hmm, I need 12059.576. So the difference is about 1.34. So perhaps adding 0.013. Let me see, 109.82^2= (109.81+0.01)^2=109.81² + 2*109.81*0.01 +0.0001 ≈ 12058.2361 + 2.1962 +0.0001≈12060.4324. Hmm, that's a bit over. So maybe 109.815^2?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just approximate E_mu as sqrt(12059.576) ≈ around 109.81 MeV.

Wait, perhaps using exact calculation would be better. Alternatively, since I'm using approximate numbers, maybe I can just proceed.

E_mu ≈ 109.81 MeV, E_nu =29.784 MeV.

Now, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 109.81 +29.784≈139.594 MeV, which is close to the initial energy of 139.6 MeV, so that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy (KE) of each particle is their total energy minus their rest energy.

For the muon: KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

For the neutrino: KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu. But since m_nu≈0, KE_nu ≈ E_nu=29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait, neutrinos are relativistic? Or perhaps in this context, their kinetic energy is just their total energy since rest mass is negligible. So KE_nu is approximately 29.784 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV (muon) and 29.784 MeV (neutrino).

Looking at the options:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I got.

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for p.

p = (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi).

We calculated m_pi² as 19488.16, m_mu² as 11172.49.

So m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by 2*m_pi: 2*139.6=279.2.

8315.67 / 279.2 = Let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 279.2 *29 = 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. That's 29 * 279.2=8096.8.

Wait, but 279.2 *29.784 is 279.2*(29 + 0.784) = 8096.8 + 279.2*0.784.

Wait, 0.784 is approximately 784/1000. So 279.2 * 784 = let's see, 279.2 *700=195440, 279.2 *84=23536.8 → total 195440+23536.8=218,976.8. Divide by 1000: 218.9768.

So 279.2 *0.784 ≈218.9768.

So 279.2 *29.784 ≈8096.8 +218.9768=8315.7768.

Which is very close to 8315.67. So 29.784 is correct, considering the approximated calculation.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV. So KE_nu is about 29.78 MeV.

KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D gives 4.12 and 29.8, which is very close. So the answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary charged pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon (\( \mu^+ \)) and a neutrino (\( \nu \)). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The neutrino is assumed to be massless (\( m_\nu \approx 0 \)).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} \). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu
   \]

### Solving for Momentum
Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, \( E = \sqrt{p^2 + m^2} \), and assuming the neutrino is massless (\( E_\nu = p_\nu \)), we substitute into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p
\]
Rearranging and solving for \( p \):  
\[
m_{\pi^+} - p = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
\]
Squaring both sides:  
\[
(m_{\pi^+} - p)^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p = m_{\mu^+}^2
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}
\]
Substituting \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):  
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
The energy of the neutrino is equal to its momentum (\( E_\nu = p \)):  
\[
E_\nu \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}
\]
The energy of the muon is:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
\]
Substituting \( p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy of each particle is its total energy minus its rest energy:  
- For the muon:  
  \[
  KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
  \]
- For the neutrino:  
  \[
  KE_\nu = E_\nu - m_\nu \approx 29.784 - 0 \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}
  \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) for the muon and \( 29.784 \, \text{MeV} \) for the neutrino. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Answer: D
