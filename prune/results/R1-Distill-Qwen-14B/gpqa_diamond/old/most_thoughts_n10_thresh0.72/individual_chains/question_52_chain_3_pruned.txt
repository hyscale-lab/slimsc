Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand everything.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics—1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in atoms. The equation is something like (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So when spots are present, the temperature is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 (I think the question is about the ratio in two levels, so maybe n1 is lower level, n2 higher) would change based on temperature.

Wait, the observed ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. That suggests that when the overall temperature is lower, the ratio is lower. So when the temperature decreases from 6000K to 5500K, the ratio decreases. Let me think about how the ratio behaves with temperature.

The ratio n1/n2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Because E2 > E1, the exponent is positive. So as T decreases, exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) ) increases, making the ratio n1/n2 increase. Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that doesn't match my initial thought.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. The problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2. So, when the spots are present, the ratio decreases. So with spots, the ratio R = n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots. So R_spot < R_no_spot.

Wait, no. Let me think. If the star is cooler (spots), the ratio R = n1/n2 goes down. So when it's cooler, R is lower. So when the temperature decreases, R decreases. So how does that happen?

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So if
