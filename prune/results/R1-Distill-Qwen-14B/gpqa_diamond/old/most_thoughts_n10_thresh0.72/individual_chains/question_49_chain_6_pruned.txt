Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning about these reactions. But let's try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, each involving a different reaction, and we have to match them with the given options A, B, C, D. Each option provides possible products for A, B, and C. So I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat → A.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a dienol (a compound with both an alcohol and an enol group) reacting with an amine, it could form a ring via a Cope or Claisen rearrangement, but wait, that's sigmatropic rearrangement. Oh wait, but that's more when you have an enol ether or something. Wait, wait. Alternatively, I think about the formation of a ring via a [3,3] sigmatropic shift.

Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine—so that's (CH3O)2CHNH2. But wait, no, wait: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be NH2-C(OCH3)2. Because ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure is (CH3O)2CHNH2.

So when that reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is (from the numbering) position 2: so it's CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3, but wait, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe it's better to think of it as (CH2)2CH(OH)CH2? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? But wait, but-3-en would imply a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C3. So, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2, but that's not possible. Wait, no, for but-3-en-2-ol, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the hydroxyl is on C2. So it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, that would be but-2-en-3-ol. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol:
