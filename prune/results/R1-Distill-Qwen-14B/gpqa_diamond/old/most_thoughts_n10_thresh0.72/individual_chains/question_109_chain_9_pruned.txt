Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, I remember that when particles are emitted, certain quantum numbers have to be conserved, like angular momentum and parity. Let me try to think through this.

The question says that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Wait, so the initial state is 1S0, which I think means S=0 because the S in the term symbol is the spin. Oh wait, the term symbol is defined as (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 would mean (2*0 +1) = 1, so S=0, L is S (so L=0?), and J=0. So initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, total angular momentum 0.

The Pauli statistics condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, and L is orbital angular momentum. But in the initial state, the NN system has T=0 (since it's 1S0, which I think refers to the triplet or singlet state; wait, no, T=0 would be a singlet, T=1 is triplet. Since 1S0 is the singlet state, T=0. So in the initial state, T=0, S=0, L=0.

After emission of particle X, the final NN state has T=0. So I guess the isospin doesn't change because the system's T is still 0. But I'm not entirely sure about isospin conservation; maybe it's more about angular momentum and parity here.

The problem is about which partial wave isn't allowed. Partial waves refer to the orbital angular momentum L in the emitted particle's state. The options give different final NN states and the possible emitted particles with different L's.

Wait, the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So its parity is negative. The parity of the system before and after must be conserved. The initial parity is for the 1S0 state. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L + something?), I think. Oh wait, the parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is
