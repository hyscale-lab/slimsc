Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I think it's a diene or something similar with multiple double bonds. Wait, looking again, I see two double bonds maybe? Because I see C=CH and CH=C, so two double bonds perhaps?

The question is asking for the enthalpy of formation, which I remember is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, to calculate that, I think we need to use bond energies for all the bonds in the molecule and compare them to the bonds in the elements (like H2 and O2, but wait, here it's just C and H).

Wait, the problem gives us some bond energies. Let me list them out:

- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon: 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, so that's the energy needed to break a carbon atom into its constituent parts, like into C atoms.
Hmm, but maybe I don't need that for the calculation. Or perhaps I do, because maybe we're considering all the bonds from the elements.

Wait, the usual approach for calculating enthalpy of formation via bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the reactants (elements)] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the products (the molecule)]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products).

Wait, no, actually, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by assuming that the molecule is formed from its constituent elements. So, if the molecule is made of C and H, we'll break the bonds in the elements (C atoms are in graphite or some standard state, H in H2) and form the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, but in this problem, I don't see any O's or other elements, so the molecule is made of C and H. So, the formation reaction would be something like:

a C (graphite) + b H2 → (CH3)2C
