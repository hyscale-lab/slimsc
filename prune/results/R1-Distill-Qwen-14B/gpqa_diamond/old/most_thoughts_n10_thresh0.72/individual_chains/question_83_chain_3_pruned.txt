Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when you titrate it with NaOH (a strong base), the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. At various points in the titration, different species are present, and we can calculate pH based on that.

First, let's figure out the initial situation after dilution. So, before adding any NaOH, we have diluted acetic acid. The initial concentration after mixing is important.

Wait, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is calculated by:

M1V1 = M2V2 → (0.05 M)(0.02 L) = M2*(0.04 L)
So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait: 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 moles. Divided by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point will be when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001. So volume is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 mL. So equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 2.5 mL added.

Wait
