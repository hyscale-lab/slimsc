Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through the question again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots. So, the reaction must have produced two products. I need to choose between the options A, B, C, or D.

Hmm. I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's usually an addition reaction. The HBr adds across the double bond. But wait, the starting material here is an aryl ether, right? The structure is an oxygen connected to a benzene ring and a substituent which is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. So the substituent is a four-carbon chain where the first carbon is attached to the oxygen of the ether, and the third carbon has the double bond.

Wait, the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which can be written as CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it out:

The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So, the chain is four carbons long. The double bond starts at C3, so it's between C2 and C3? Wait no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at C3? Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, but that would be but-1-en-3-yl, or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, the correct way is: but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's impossible because but has four carbons. So, the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2
