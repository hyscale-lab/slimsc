Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) variations for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The masses are the sum of both stars in each system.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity curves are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity because it's moving less due to the gravitational pull between them. So, the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star.

Wait, wait. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the stars' spectra. Each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit (and thus a smaller velocity), while the less massive star has a larger orbit (and higher velocity). So, the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses.

So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say the masses are M1a and M1b. Since mass is inversely proportional to velocity, M1a/M1b = velocity_b / velocity_a. So M1a/M1b = 5/10 = 1/2. So the mass ratio is 1:2. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is M1a + M1b = M1a + 2*M1a = 3*M1a.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10 km/s. So, system_2's mass ratio is 10/15 = 2/3. So, M2a/M2b = 2/3. So, the total mass is M2a + M2b = M2a + (3/2)*M2a = (5/2) M2a.

Wait, but how do these relate to each other? Let me think about the mass function. Oh, right, the mass function in binary stars is given by (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where i is the inclination. But since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1.

Wait, but without knowing the inclination, maybe I can't directly use the mass function. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities relate to the masses in a way that's independent of the period. So, the mass ratio is velocity secondary / velocity primary.

Wait, but the period is the same for each system's eclipses. Oh no, wait, the periods are different. System_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year. Hmm, but the period is the same for both stars in a binary system, right? Because they orbit each other with the same orbital period.

Wait, wait. The eclipse period is the same as the orbital period, right? So for
