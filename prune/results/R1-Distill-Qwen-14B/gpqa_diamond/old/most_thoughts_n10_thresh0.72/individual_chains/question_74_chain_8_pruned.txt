Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the exact concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The question is about the probability of an atom decaying. We’re told that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Then, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, so the next 150 minutes starting from now (after 50 minutes have passed). So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

Wait, but I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. The key here is that the decay process is memoryless. Oh right, that's the property of the exponential distribution. So the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it only depends on the remaining time.

So the initial 32% probability is for a 100-minute period. Let me think: if the decay probability in time t is P, then P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Or wait, wait, actually, the probability that it has decayed by time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). But wait, the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that would be the probability that the atom decays at some time between 0 and 100 minutes. So that's P = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). 

Alternatively, maybe they mean the probability that it decays within that time. So yes, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So from that, we can find λ.

But wait, the question is about the next 150 minutes. But since the process is memoryless, the fact that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet doesn't change the future probability. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays between t=50 and t=200 minutes.

Wait, but another way to think about it is: the probability of decay in any time interval of length T is the same regardless of when
