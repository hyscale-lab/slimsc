Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector made up of the Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, right? And their trace is zero, so they're traceless. But more importantly, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Oh, but wait, the Hamiltonian here is a dot product of σ and n, multiplied by ε.

So, the general form of such a Hamiltonian would look like H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

Eigenvalues of σ · n. Hmm, wait, I think the eigenvalues of σ · n are just ±1 because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and since n is a unit vector, the combination should also have eigenvalues ±1. Because when you take a linear combination of Pauli matrices with coefficients that satisfy n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1, the resulting operator's eigenvalues are ±√(ε² (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²)), but since that's 1, it's ε times ±1.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The eigenvalues of σ·n would be ±1, because σ·n is a Hermitian operator. The trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the two eigenvalues must be +1 and -1. Then, when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues become ε * 1 and ε * (-1), so +ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B says +ε and -ε. That fits. Let me see the options again.

Option A is ±1, which doesn't have ε. So that's probably if ε was 1, but here ε is a general energy constant. So A is not correct unless ε is 1, which isn't stated.

Option C has ε multiplied by ħ/2. Oh, wait, wait! Wait, let me think about the Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, has eigenvalues ±1. So if H is ε times σ·n, then H's eigenvalues would be ε*(±1) — so B is correct.

Wait, but sometimes I've seen spin Hamiltonians written as (σ · n) multiplied by some factors. For example, maybe if the spin is 1/2, then the eigenvalues would be (something with ħ). Oh wait, but wait! Wait a second. Wait, σ is the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues ±1. So H = ε σ · n would have eigenvalues ±ε. Unless perhaps there's a factor of something else, like maybe when spin matrices are involved with factors of ħ/2.

Wait, no. Hold on. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. So when you scale them by ε, the eigenvalues would be ±ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε, which is option B.

Wait, but wait—could there be a factor of ħ involved here? Let me think. The Pauli matrices are often used in the context of spin, where the spin operator is (ħ/2) σ. So if the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ, then the eigenvalues of S·n would be ± ħ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ·n. So unless ε already includes the ħ/2 factor, the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

So the question says ε is a constant with dimension of energy. So that must include any necessary factors, like if ε = (ħ ω) or something. So in this case, the answer is ±ε, option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are \(\pm 1\), and since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are also \(\pm 1\). When multiplied by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\(\pm 1\))**: This corresponds to the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) alone, but it does not include the factor of \(\varepsilon\), which is part of the Hamiltonian. Hence, this is incorrect.
- **Option B (\(\pm \varepsilon\))**: This correctly accounts for the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) scaled by \(\varepsilon\). This matches the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian.
- **Option C (\(\pm \varepsilon \hbar/2\))**: This introduces an additional factor of \(\hbar/2\), which is not present in the given Hamiltonian. Hence, this is incorrect.
- **Option D (\(\pm \hbar/2\))**: This corresponds to the eigenvalues of the spin operator \((\hbar/2) \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), but it does not include the factor of \(\varepsilon\). Hence, this is also incorrect.

The correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
