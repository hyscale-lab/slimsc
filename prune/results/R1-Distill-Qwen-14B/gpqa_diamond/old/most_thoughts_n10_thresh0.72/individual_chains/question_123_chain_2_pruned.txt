Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I remember that in physics, when dealing with different reference frames, especially moving ones, I might need to use special relativity. But wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames don't accelerate, so that's good because it simplifies things. 

The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that's like saying the ejecta is stationary and the galaxy is moving. But wait, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at that speed. Oh, because of the relative motion.

The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? So we're given the time in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame.

I think this involves time dilation. Because in special relativity, moving clocks run slower. So the time experienced in the galaxy's frame would be longer than the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, let me think. The ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the galaxy. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is
