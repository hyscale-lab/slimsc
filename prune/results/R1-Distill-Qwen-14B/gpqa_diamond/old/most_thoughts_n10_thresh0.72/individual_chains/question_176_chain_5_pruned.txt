Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, so I'll take it slowly.

The problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they need to be normalized. Let me check the norm of this vector. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. But maybe I can proceed without normalizing it for now because probabilities might involve the squared magnitudes, and maybe the normalization cancels out? Let me see later.

We have two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as matrices. The operator for P has elements: first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The operator Q has a diagonal matrix with elements (1, 0, -1).

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure one observable, it affects the state of the system. So measuring P first will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q on that new state will give another probability. But wait, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P"â€”so it's sequential measurements. So the process is: measure P, get outcome 0, then measure Q on the resulting state and get outcome -1. What's the combined probability?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 in sequence. But I think the way to approach this is to find the state after measuring P=0, then compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 in that new state.

Wait, but first, I need to find the possible eigenvalues of P. Because when you measure P, you get one of its eigenvalues. The operator P is given
