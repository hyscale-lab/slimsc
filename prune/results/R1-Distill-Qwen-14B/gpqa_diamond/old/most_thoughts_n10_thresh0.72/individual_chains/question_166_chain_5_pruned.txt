Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the Standard Model extension with some Lagrangian given. The question is about finding the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. Hmm, okay.

So, the Lagrangian has several terms. Let me look at the terms: there's the Dirac term for NR, which is a singlet fermion. Then there's the kinetic term for the scalar phi, and the covariant derivative squared term for S, which is a scalar doublet. Oh wait, S is a doublet, so it's probably involved in electroweak symmetry breaking. Then there are some terms with y_i and g_{iα}, which are coupling constants. And a potential V involving phi, S, and H. Wait, H isn't mentioned in the fields, so maybe H is part of S or another field?

The fields given: N_i R is a singlet fermion with quantum numbers (1,1,0), meaning it's a right-handed singlet under SU(2) and maybe under some other group. The scalar S is a doublet, (1,2,1), so it's an SU(2) doublet, and the singlet scalar phi is (1,1,0). 

The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given: ⟨phi⟩ squared is x² + v², so phi's VEV is x, and another field's VEV is v. Wait, wait, looking back, the problem says ⟨phi⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. Oh wait, did I miss the h scalar? The scalar S is a doublet, so maybe h is one of the components of S. Like, S could be written as (h+, (v + h)/√2), where v is the VEV. But wait, the given VEV ⟨phi⟩ is x, and ⟨h⟩ is v. Hmm, maybe phi is another field that gets a VEV.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. The problem says that N_i R are singlet fermions, scalar doublet S, and singlet scalar phi. So the potential V(phi, S, H) must involve all these fields. Let me think about how the symmetry breaking works here. 

In the Standard Model, the Higgs is a doublet that gets a VEV. Here, phi is a singlet scalar that also gets a VEV. So perhaps we have two Higgs fields: the doublet S and the singlet phi. The potential V would then lead to some mixing between them, maybe. But in the given Lagrangian, I don't see any direct coupling between phi and S, except through the terms given. 

Wait, the Lagrangian has terms like (D^μ S)^2, which is the kinetic term for the gauge interactions of S. Then there's a term with phi times N's, which are the Yukawa terms
