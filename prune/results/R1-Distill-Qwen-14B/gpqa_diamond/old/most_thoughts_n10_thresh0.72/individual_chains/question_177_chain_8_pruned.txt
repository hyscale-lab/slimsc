Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, that probably relates to their temperatures, right? Because for black bodies, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. Oh wait, yes, Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same? So T1 equals T2. That's a key point.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us at that particular moment. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, does radial velocity affect the luminosity as observed from Earth? I'm not sure. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, the total energy emitted per second. But wait, when a star is moving towards us, there's a Doppler shift which can affect the observed brightness, but I think that's more about the flux we receive rather than the intrinsic luminosity. So for calculating luminosity ratio, perhaps we can ignore the radial velocities because luminosity is independent of velocity. Or maybe it's about the relativistic effects on the star's properties. Hmm, I'm not too sure about that, but since the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, perhaps the velocities don't directly affect the calculation—maybe we can set them aside for this part.

So the question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are around 2.2 to 2.35, so the factor is something like that.

Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh wait, but when we observe the star, the flux (apparent brightness) depends on distance, but the problem is about luminosity, which is intrinsic.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers
