Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian distributions, which are typical for coherent states, for example.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, I think |alpha> is a coherent state. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, right? And they are Gaussian states. So this state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, scaled by cos(phi) and sin(phi) respectively.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). That makes sense because when you have a superposition of two states, the normalization factor comes from the inner product of the state with itself. So |cos(phi)|^2 ||alpha>||^2 + |sin(phi)|^2 ||-alpha>||^2 + cross terms. Since coherent states have a norm of exp(-2|alpha|^2) when you take <alpha|beta> where beta = -alpha, which would be exp(-2|alpha|^2) * exp(i (alpha - beta) ... but wait, I think for |alpha> and |-alpha>, the inner product is <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|^2) * something. Wait, no, the inner product is actually <alpha|beta> = exp(-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha* beta ). So when beta is -alpha, it becomes exp( -|alpha|^2 + alpha*(-alpha) )= exp( -|alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2 )= exp(-2 |alpha|^2). Oh wait, that's the cross terms.

So the normalization N squared is [cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi)] + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2). Because the diagonal terms are cos^2 and sin^2, and the cross terms come from the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is exp(-2 alpha^2). So N squared is [1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)], hence N is the square root of that.

The problem says to calculate the non-Gaussianity, which is given by delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussianity is usually a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity would be the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition here. I think the relative entropy is also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence in some contexts, but here it's being used to measure the difference between two quantum states.

So, the formula given is delta_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. The von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho). So when you subtract S(tau) from S(rho), you get the non-Gaussian part, I guess.

But wait, how do we choose the reference Gaussian state tau? Because for non-Gaussian states, the reference Gaussian state is the one that best approximates it in some sense, perhaps the one that minimizes the relative entropy. So the non-Gaussianity is the minimal relative entropy between the state rho and any Gaussian state tau.

But in this problem, I think they're giving us the formula as delta_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], so it's the difference in entropies. But to compute this, I need to find the von Neumann entropy of rho and compare it to that of tau.

But wait, wait. No, because the
