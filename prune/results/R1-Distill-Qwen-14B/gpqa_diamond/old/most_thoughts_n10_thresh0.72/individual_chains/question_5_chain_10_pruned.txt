Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, right? Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the operator is P, and it's a vector operator—so it has components Px, Py, Pz. The direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, the x-z plane? That means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz). But since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the operator P is being considered in the direction of some vector that lies entirely in x and z.

Wait, but then the problem says we need the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator in the direction n would be P · n, right? Because when you have an operator along a direction, you take the dot product of the vector operator with the unit vector in that direction. So the operator in question is P along n: that would be P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

But wait, the problem says "for a muon", but I don't think that affects anything because muons are just like electrons in terms of spin—so spin-1/2 particles.

So the operator P is a vector operator, and each component is given. Let me write down each component matrix.

Given:
P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1
