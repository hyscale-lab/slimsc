Okay, I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me think through this step by step.

So the setup is three spins, S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). And we need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Since β is 1/(kT), so each term is e^(-E/(kT)).

Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1, so each has two possible states. For three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to consider all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the structure of the energy.

The energy is E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Let me think about each term: each product S_i S_j will be +1 if the spins are aligned, and -1 if anti-aligned.

So the total inside the energy is the sum of the three pairwise products. Let me denote this sum as H = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3.

So E = -J H. Therefore, each state's energy is proportional to -J times H. So the exponent in the partition function will be β E = β (-J H) = -β J H.

So for each state, the Boltzmann factor is e^{β E} = e^{-β J H}.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, the partition function Z is the sum of e^{-β E} over all states. Because Z is Sum_{states} exp(-E/(k T)).

So since E = -J H, then exp(-E/(k T)) becomes exp( (J H)/(k T)) ) = exp( β J H ). So each term in the sum is e^{ β J H }.

So Z = sum_{all states} e^{ β J H }, where H is S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3
