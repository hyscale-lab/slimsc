Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I think I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of relativity. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula.

So the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy.

Wait, I need to clarify: when they're moving in the same direction, how do I find the relative speed? Oh, right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

But wait, the astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds. Let me think: So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So substituting into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Simplifying numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed should be 0.14c, which matches options C and D.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the relative speed the speed of one as seen from the other's frame? Because in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A (2m, 0.6c) would see astronaut B (3m, 0.5c) moving at a relative speed of (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1428c. So yeah, approximately 0.14c.

But wait, the problem says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." So I need to compute both. Let me switch to calculating the total energy.

Total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. So energy E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c²
