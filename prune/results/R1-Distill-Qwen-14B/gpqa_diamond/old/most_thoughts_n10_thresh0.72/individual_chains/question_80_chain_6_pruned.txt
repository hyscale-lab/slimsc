Okay, so I've got this problem where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and gives a number as output. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I need to figure out what the value is for the input ACAGTGACC.

Hmm, let me start by looking at the examples. I should try to find a pattern or a rule that converts the DNA sequence into a number.

First, let's break down the first example: AGG. The output is 115. DNA sequences are made of nucleotides A, T, C, G. Maybe each nucleotide is converted into a number and then summed up, multiplied, or something like that.

Let's list the nucleotides in AGG: A, G, G.

Wait, the output is 115. Let's see if each letter corresponds to a number. Maybe A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4? Let me test that.

AGG would be A=1, G=4, G=4. So 1 +4 +4 =9. That doesn't match 115. Maybe it's multiplication? 1*4*4=16. Not 115. Hmm, not that either.

Another approach: Maybe each letter is mapped to a single digit, and then the digits are concatenated. Wait, AGG is three letters, output is three digits. Let's see: A=1, G=4, G=4. So 144? Not 115. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe each nucleotide is converted into two digits. A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Then AGG would be 10 +40 +40 =90. No, not 115. Or maybe the sum of the digits: 1+4+4=9. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's something with the positions of the letters in the alphabet. A is the first letter, which is 1. G is 7, so 1,7,7. If I sum them, 1+7+7=15. No, that's not 115. Maybe 177? No, 115.

Wait, perhaps it's something else. Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a different
