Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The setup involves finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r at time t, given that t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct based on the theory I remember.

Wait, right, potentials in electrodynamics. So, the scalar potential V is usually associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A with the magnetic field. The potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations, I think. They are used in the Lorenz gauge condition or something like that.

I remember that the scalar potential due to a charge is similar to Coulomb's law, but with some modifications when the charge is moving. Oh wait, but when charges move, things get more complicated because of their velocity and possible acceleration. But I'm not sure how that directly affects the potentials here.

So, let's think about the general form of the potentials. For a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials are given by retarded potentials. The scalar potential V is given by q/(4πε0 r), but wait, no—wait, because when the charge is moving, the expressions might involve some terms with velocity. Or maybe not for V. Hmm. Alternatively, I think the scalar potential comes from the charge's contribution,
