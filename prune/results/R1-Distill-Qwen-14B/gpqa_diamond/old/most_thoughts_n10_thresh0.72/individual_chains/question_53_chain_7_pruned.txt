Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group, so the IR peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ would indicate that.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

- Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's di-substituted, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. If the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would split into two sets: two protons each as a doublet. But wait, in the case of ortho and para, maybe the environment is different. Also, I remember that in di-substituted rings, the coupling between aromatic protons can give rise to different splitting patterns. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll keep that in mind.

- Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in an ester group. Wait, esters have R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R. So, maybe the vinyl groups are part of a substituent like an ethyl group attached to the oxygen, or perhaps part of an aromatic substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene could be ester groups. For example, maybe something like a methyl ester or ethyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are vinyl groups, but that doesn't seem to fit with the ester IR peak. Hmm.

Wait, the ester group would be something like O-CO-O-R. So, the substituents on the benzene would be ester groups. Or maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, but since it's di-substituted, perhaps both are ester groups. But wait, that might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, the substituents could be groups that have vinyl protons. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet, one doublet of quartets. That makes me think of coupling between two sets of protons. For example, in an ethylene group where each set of protons is split by adjacent protons. Like in an ethyl group attached to an oxygen in an ester. Wait, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. So, if R is an ethyl group, then the ethyl protons would be split in a certain way. But wait, the ethyl group in an ester (like OCH2CH3) would have the CH2 protons split into a quartet (due to coupling with the adjacent CH3), and the CH3 as a triplet. But in this NMR description, the vinyl-H's are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm.
