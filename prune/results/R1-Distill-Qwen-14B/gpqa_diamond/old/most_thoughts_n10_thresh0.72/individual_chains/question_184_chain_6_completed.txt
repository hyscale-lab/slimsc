Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about which sequence of reactions would give a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me try to visualize the structure.

So, the target has three substituents on the benzene ring: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be a bit confusing. Let me think: the compound is named 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at adjacent positions, 1, 2, 3. So the ring is like ethoxy at position 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2. So how do I arrange that?

Now, the problem is about which reaction sequence achieves this. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. Let's think about what each reaction does.

Starting with benzene, the general approach to introduce substituents is through electrophilic substitution. So each substituent is added one by one, but the order matters because the position of substitution is influenced by the directing groups of the existing substituents.

First, let's note the substituents:

1. ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)
2. tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)
3. nitro group (-NO2)

Each of these can be introduced via different reactions. 

I recall that nitration (adding nitro groups) is done with HNO3 and H2SO4 as a catalyst. Similarly, tert-butyl chloride can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, no, wait: Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl halides, but tert-butyl chloride might be difficult because it's a tertiary alkyl halide, but wait, Friedel-Crafts typically doesn't work well for tertiary alkyl halides because of carbocation rearrangements. Oh wait, I think that's for alkylation. So maybe another method is needed.

Wait, the tert-butyl group is a bulky substituent. How is that added to benzene? Friedel-Crafts for alkylation might not be the best because of possible carbocation rearrangements. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use some other method, like maybe using a Grignard reagent or something else. Or wait, perhaps tert-butyl chloride can still be used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation despite being tertiary? Or does it require a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3. Alternatively, another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents' directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director, and alkyl groups (like tert-butyl) are activating, ortho/para directors. Wait, but once a substituent is added, the next substitution will depend on the directing effects of all existing substituents.

Wait, let me list the substituents in terms of their activating or deactivating nature and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy (-OCH2CH3): activating (because it's an electron-donating group via lone pairs), ortho/para-directing.
- Nitro (-NO2): deactivating (electron-withdrawing), meta-directing.
- tert-Butyl: activating (electron-donating via alkyl groups), ortho/para-directing.

So, the order in which these substituents are added will affect where the next substituent goes.

Now, the target compound has the substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let's number the positions such that substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So in a row, 1,2,3. So the substituents are adjacent. How can this happen?

Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a meta arrangement? Or wait, no, in a benzene ring, any three adjacent positions would be 1,2,3, which would form a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But the substituents here are in positions 1,2,3, which are adjacent. So the substituents are all in the 1,2,3 positions, which are adjacent in a row. So, if benzene has substituents in the 1,2,3 positions, that's a vicinal arrangement for the substituents.

Wait, but in benzene, each substituent can influence where the next goes. So, the problem is about the order in which substituents are added so that each new group goes to the correct position.

Let me think about the possible steps. Suppose we start with benzene. The first substituent could be ethoxy, nitro, or tert-butyl. Let's see.

If I add ethoxy first, that's an activating group, ortho/para-directing. Then, adding the next substituent would be influenced by the ethoxy.

If I add nitro first, that's a deactivating group, meta-directing. Then the next substituent would come in a position influenced by the nitro group.

Alternatively, adding tert-butyl first: activating, ortho/para-directing. Then the next substituent would come in ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Hmm, but in the target, the substituents are in adjacent positions. So maybe the first substituent is one that directs the next into an adjacent position.

Wait, but perhaps the order of substitution is such that the second substituent is added ortho to the first, and then the third in the adjacent position.

Wait, but let's think about the target structure: substituents at 1,2,3. So perhaps the substituents are added in a way where each new substituent is ortho to the previous one. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are added in a certain order that allows the directing effects to guide the next substitution into the desired position.

Let me think about possible sequences.

Option D: Let's look at the options. The options are given as steps i through ix, each a reaction.

But perhaps I should think of each possible reaction step, considering what each reagent does.

Each step in the options is a reaction step. Let's take a general approach to figure out the correct order.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is a meta director, but if it's added after ethoxy, which is para/ortho, perhaps the nitro would go in a position relative to ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

But let's think about the directing effects.

Suppose benzene is first nitrated. That would add a nitro group. Then, the next substitution would be influenced by nitro, which is meta-directing, so the next group would come in a meta position relative to nitro. But in the target, the substituents are adjacent, so perhaps this isn't the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps benzene is first ethoxy-substituted. Then, the next substitution is tert-butyl, which would go ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, the third substituent (nitro) would be added in a position influenced by both ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, but let me think step by step.

Let's say the first substituent is ethoxy. So benzene becomes ethoxybenzene. Next, we add tert-butyl. Since ethoxy is an activating group and ortho/para directing, the tert-butyl would add either ortho or para to the ethoxy group.

Suppose it adds ortho to ethoxy. Then the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl). Now, adding the nitro group.

In this case, the ring now has two groups: ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So the next substituent, nitro, which is a deactivating, meta-directing group, would be influenced by both substituents.

Wait, but when multiple substituents are present, the most activating group usually directs the incoming group. Alternatively, the positions available are influenced by all substituents.

In this scenario, the ethoxy and tert-butyl are both activating, so perhaps the next group (nitro) would be added in a position that is ortho or para to one of them, unless hindered by the other substituents.

Wait, but nitro is meta to the existing substituents because it's a deactivating group. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added first. Let's say benzene is first nitrated, adding a nitro group. Then, the next substituent would be directed to a position meta to nitro. Then, the third substituent would be added.

But in the target, the substituents are at 1,2,3. So if nitro is at position 3, then ethoxy is at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. Or perhaps another arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. Let's see.

Wait, first step: nitration. So benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

Second step: introduce ethoxy. Nitro is a meta director. So ethoxy would add in the meta position relative to nitro. So nitro is at position 1, ethoxy at position 3, perhaps?

Wait, but in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Let me try that:

1. Ethoxy is added to benzene: becomes ethoxybenzene.

2. Then, tert-butyl is added: since ethoxy directs ortho/para, the tert-butyl will add either ortho or para to ethoxy.

Assuming it's added ortho, the substituents would be at positions 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl). Now, the ring has two substituents: ethoxy (activating) and tert-butyl (activating).

3. Next, add nitro group. Now, the nitro group is a meta director. But in this case, the existing substituents are both activating. So where would the nitro group go?

The nitration reaction is a deactivating step. The incoming nitro group would typically enter a position that is meta to any existing substituent, but considering the existing substituents, which are activating, they would direct the nitro group to their ortho or para positions.

Wait, no. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, but when it's being added, the directing effect is based on the existing substituents. When adding a nitro group, the existing substituents (ethoxy and tert-butyl) are activating, so they would direct the incoming nitro group to their ortho or para positions.

Hmm.

Wait, but once the nitro group is added, it will deactivate the ring, making subsequent reactions more difficult. But in this case, we are only adding three substituents. So maybe the nitro is added last.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added before the tert-butyl. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: add ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Wait, let's think about that.

1. Ethoxy is added to benzene: ethoxybenzene.

2. Next, nitration: since ethoxy is activating and ortho/para directing, the nitro group would add in the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy.

If it adds in ortho, then ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 2. Now, when adding tert-butyl, the directing would be influenced by both ethoxy and nitro.

But nitro is a deactivating group and meta-directing. Ethoxy is activating and ortho/para.

So when adding tert-butyl, the available positions would be influenced by both substituents. Let's imagine the ring with ethoxy at position 1 and nitro at 2.

The tert-butyl would have to go where both ethoxy and nitro can direct.

Ethoxy (position 1) is ortho/para-directing, so possible positions are 2 (already has nitro), 4 (para to 1), or 6 (ortho to 1, which is already taken by nitro at 2? Wait, no, in benzene, position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has nitro.

So the possible positions for tert-butyl would be influenced by both substituents. Nitro at position 2 is meta-directing, so it would direct incoming groups to positions 5 (meta to 2) and maybe 4 and 6? Or perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, since ethoxy is at 1, and nitro at 2, the tert-butyl could be added at position 3 or 4 or 6?

Wait, ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 2. The ring:

Positions:

1: ethoxy

2: nitro

3: empty

4: empty

5: empty

6: empty

Now, adding tert-butyl. Ethoxy directs to ortho/para: ortho would be 2 and 6, but 2 is taken. Para would be 4. Nitro at 2 is meta-directing, so directs to 5 and 6.

So the possible positions for tert-butyl are 4 and 5 and 6? Wait, no. Ethoxy directs to 2 (taken), 6 (ortho), and 4 (para). Nitro directs to 5 and 6 (meta to 2). So the tert-butyl could go to 4 or 5 or 6.

But in the target, tert-butyl is at position 2, which is already taken by nitro. So that can't be. So maybe my initial assumption about the order is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl is added before the nitro.

Let me try this order:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation is tricky for tertiary alkyl halides because of carbocation rearrangements. So perhaps that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe it's a better approach to use a directing group that would allow the tert-butyl to be added in a specific position.

Wait, perhaps the first substituent is tert-butyl. Then, the next is ethoxy, then nitro.

So:

1. Add tert-butyl to benzene. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene. Since tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para-directing.

2. Next, add ethoxy. Since the ring is activated, the ethoxy group will add either ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.

If added in ortho, then substituents are at positions 1 (tert-butyl) and 2 (ethoxy). Then, nitro would be added.

3. Now, adding nitro. The ring has tert-butyl at 1 and ethoxy at 2. Both are activating groups, so they direct incoming nitro to their ortho or para positions. But nitro is a deactivating group, so once added, it will deactivate the ring.

But in this case, where would the nitro group go? Let's imagine position 3.

If tert-butyl is at 1, ethoxy at 2, then possible positions for nitro would be influenced by both.

Ethoxy at 2 directs to 1 (taken by tert-butyl), 3, and 6.

Tert-butyl at 1 directs to 2 (taken by ethoxy), 4, and 6.

So possible positions for nitro would be 3 and 4 and 6.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3. So if in step 3, the nitro group is added at position 3, that would be the desired position.

But wait, the target is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. Hmm, no, target is 2-tert-butyl, 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. Wait, no, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So maybe the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl (in ortho), then nitro.

So step 1: benzene → ethoxybenzene.

Step 2: ethoxybenzene → add tert-butyl ortho to ethoxy.

So now, substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl).

Step 3: add nitro group. Now, the ring has ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So nitro group will be directed to a position that is ortho or para to either substituent.

But since nitro is a meta director, perhaps the existing substituents (both activating) will direct it to their ortho or para positions.

Wait, but the nitro group is being added, so the existing substituents are ethoxy and tert-butyl, both activating. So the nitro will go to a position that is ortho or para to either of them.

So with ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, the possible positions for nitro would be:

- Ortho to ethoxy: 2 (taken by tert-butyl) or 6.

- Para to ethoxy: 4.

- Ortho to tert-butyl: 1 (taken by ethoxy) or 3.

- Para to tert-butyl: 5.

So the possible positions are 3,4,5,6.

But in the target, nitro is at 3. So if the nitro group is added at position 3, that would be ortho to tert-butyl (at 2) and meta to ethoxy (at 1). So yes, that could work.

So the order of substituents would be ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

But wait, how would the nitro group be added in that case. Let's see.

But let's think about the reaction conditions. Nitration is done under strong acidic conditions with H2SO4 as a catalyst. So when adding the nitro group after ethoxy and tert-butyl, will the nitro group add in the correct position?

Wait, but in the scenario where the ring has activating groups, the nitro group will enter at a position that is most activated. But since both ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating, the incoming nitro group would be directed to their ortho and para positions.

In the case where ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, the possible positions for nitro would be 3 (ortho to 2), 4 (para to 1), 5 (para to 2), and 6 (ortho to 1 and meta to 2). Hmm, in this case, position 3 is ortho to 2 (tert-butyl) and meta to 1 (ethoxy). So nitro could go there.

So the sequence would be: ethoxy added first, then tert-butyl in the ortho position, then nitro in the meta position relative to ethoxy or ortho to tert-butyl.

So the steps would be:

1. Ethoxylation: benzene → ethoxybenzene using ethoxy group introduction. (Friedel-Crafts for ethers? Wait, no, ethoxy is usually introduced by nucleophilic substitution, but wait, benzene doesn't have a leaving group. Oh wait, perhaps it's better to use a different method. Oh right, ethoxy group can be introduced via the Williamson ether synthesis using an alkoxide and a suitable alkyl halide, but benzene's electrophilic substitution would require a different approach. Oh wait, no, I think that the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl or acyl groups. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group already present, which benzene doesn't have. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction with an ethyl halide in the presence of a strong base, but that's not standard for benzene. Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but that's usually for forming ethers. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution where a leaving group is present, but benzene doesn't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced as a side reaction, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh, wait! The ethoxy group is introduced via nitration followed by some other steps. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an O-alkylation, but that requires the presence of a good leaving group on oxygen, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via the hydrolysis of an ethyl sulfonate group, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an electrophilic substitution using an ethyl halide with a Lewis acid catalyst, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation usually deals with alkyl halides, but for alkylation, the usual method is Friedel-Crafts, but as I thought earlier, with tert-butyl chloride, it might not work due to carbocation rearrangements. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added via the Pummerer rearrangement, but that's for acetophenone derivatives. No, perhaps I should think differently. Oh, wait! The ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group, like a nitro group, which is actually deactivating. Wait, no, nitro is deactivating, meta-directing. So maybe ethoxy is added via some other method.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction where an ethyl group is attached to the ring, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that would give an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options more carefully. Let's look at the options and see which one might have the correct order.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction? Fe/HCl is often used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but wait, in the presence of an aromatic ring, perhaps it's used for something else. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used for the Bechamp reduction, which reduces nitro groups to amines. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, after nitration, maybe the next step is something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation?

Then, NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

H3O+ H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

EtBr/NaOH → ethoxy group via Williamson?

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me try to outline each option's steps.

Option A:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butylCl → adds t-butyl to benzene.

2. Nitration → adds nitro group.

3. Sulfonation.

4. Diazotization.

5. Hydrolysis.

6. NaOH with EtBr → perhaps O-ethylation.

Wait, but after nitration and sulfonation, I'm not sure how that would lead to the target. Also, the target has ethoxy, nitro, and t-butyl groups.

Option B:

i) t-butylCl/AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction (could reduce nitro to amine?)

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again?

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → O-ethylation.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

This seems complicated. Maybe adding another nitro group isn't right.

Option C:

i) t-butylCl/AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → O-ethylation.

Hmm, multiple steps, including multiple nitrations and reductions. Not sure.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iii) t-butylCl/AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → O-ethylation.

Wait, but the target has an ethoxy group. So perhaps the final step is ethoxylation via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but to get an ethoxy group, perhaps a substitution reaction is needed. For example, if there's a good leaving group like a tosylate or mesylate, then replacing it with ethoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a ring that's activated towards nucleophilic attack, usually with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, looking back at the target molecule, the substituents are ethoxy (activating), nitro (deactivating), and t-butyl (activating). So the ring is a mix of activating and deactivating groups, making it difficult for nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an O-alkylation, which typically requires an alkoxide. For example, using NaOH and EtBr (option A, step vii) would give an ethoxy group via SN2, but that requires a good leaving group attached to oxygen. But in this case, perhaps the O is part of a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group.

Wait, sulfonic acid groups can act as leaving groups. So perhaps the reaction involves introducing a sulfonic acid group, then substituting it with an ethoxy group.

Looking back at option A, step iii is sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4), which adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). Then, perhaps that group is replaced with ethoxide via NaOH and EtBr. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in option D, step vi is sulfonation, then step ix is NaOH and EtBr. So perhaps the sulfonic acid group is replaced with ethoxy.

Wait, but how does that happen? If we have a benzene ring with a sulfonic acid group, then treating with NaOH and EtBr would substitute the sulfonic acid (which is a good leaving group under those conditions) with an ethoxy group.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine? Fe/HCl is used for that. So nitrobenzene → aniline.

Wait, but then step iii is Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride. Aniline is an activating group, so t-butyl would add ortho/para to the amine group.

But then step iv is another nitration. Aniline is a strong activating group, so nitration would add nitro in ortho/para. But that's adding a nitro group into an already substituted ring, which may complicate the structure.

Hmm, perhaps option D is not the correct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro. Let me think about which option would allow that.

Looking at the options, option B: first t-butyl, then nitrate, then Fe/HCl (reduction?), then nitrate again, etc. Doesn't seem right.

Option C: starts with t-butyl, then sulfonate, then nitrate. Hmm, not sure.

Option A: starts with t-butyl, nitrates, sulfonates, etc.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-butyl Cl via Friedel-Crafts to benzene. Now, benzene is t-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate t-butylbenzene. Since t-butyl is activating and ortho/para, nitro group would add either ortho or para to t-butyl.

3. Then, introduce ethoxy group. How?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. But benzene derivatives with a nitro group would be deactivating. So after nitration, the ring is deactivating, making electrophilic substitution difficult. So adding ethoxy (which requires an activating group) would be hard unless there's another activating group present.

Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe the order should be ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

In that case, the steps would be:

1. Ethoxylation: benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-butyl.

3. Nitration.

But again, the issue is adding ethoxy to benzene via Friedel-Crafts. Wait, no, ethoxy is not an alkyl halide; Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups. To introduce an ether group (ethoxy), perhaps a different method is needed.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group, which benzene doesn't have. So that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's beyond basic synthesis steps.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about each option's steps and see which one logically adds the substituents in the correct order.

Option D: The steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butylCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → add t-butyl to aniline.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+ H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → O-ethylation.

Wait, after nitration, reduction gives aniline, then t-butyl adds. Aniline is activating, so t-butyl would add ortho or para. Then another nitration would add nitro in para to aniline, perhaps. Then diazotization and hydrolysis would form something else, and finally O-ethylation.

But in the target, the substituents are ethoxy, nitro, and t-butyl. So perhaps this sequence isn't leading to the correct substituents.

Option C:

i) t-butylCl/AlCl3 → add t-butyl to benzene → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate → t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → add nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+ H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → O-ethylation.

Hmm, after t-butyl and sulfonate, nitration would add nitro. Then reduction to amine, diazotization, etc. I don't think this leads to the correct substituents.

Option B:

i) t-butylCl/AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) nitrate → add nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate → add another nitro? Unlikely, since target has one nitro.

So probably not.

Option A:

i) t-butylCl/AlCl3 → add t-butyl to benzene.

ii) nitrate → add nitro, which would go ortho or para to t-butyl.

iii) sulfonate → add sulfonic acid group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis (maybe of a diazonium salt to a phenol?).

vi) NaOH and EtBr → O-ethylation (substituting a leaving group with ethoxy).

vii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate again.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So this seems like it's adding multiple nitro groups, which isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to outline each option to find the one that adds the substituents in the correct positions.

The target molecule has the substituents in the order: ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So the substituents are at positions 1,2,3 in a row. That implies that each substituent is added adjacent to the previous one.

But in electrophilic substitution, substituents are added based on the directing effects of the existing groups.

So perhaps the first substituent is t-butyl, then ethoxy is added ortho to it, then nitro is added meta to ethoxy, but ortho to t-butyl. Hmm.

Wait, here's another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after the nitro group.

But that would require the ring to be activated, which it wouldn't be if the nitro group is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Then, ethoxy is added in a position that's meta to nitro, and tert-butyl in a position ortho to ethoxy.

Let me try this order:

1. Nitration → add nitro at position 1.

2. Ethoxylation → add ethoxy at position 3 (meta to nitro).

3. Add tert-butyl in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy and meta to nitro).

But how?

Wait, when nitro is at position 1, the next substituent (ethoxy) would be added meta to nitro, which would be position 4. Then tert-butyl would be added ortho to ethoxy (position 3 or 5). But that doesn't give the desired positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, then ethoxy in para to nitro, then tert-butyl in ortho to ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing, so ethoxy would be added in position 4 (meta to nitro at 1). Then, tert-butyl would be added ortho to ethoxy at 4, which would be positions 3 or 5. So that would place substituents at 1 (nitro), 4 (ethoxy), and 3 (tert-butyl). But the target has substituents at 1, 2, 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, let's think about the nitro group being added last. So the first two groups are ethoxy and t-butyl, and the nitro is added in the correct position.

But the problem is adding ethoxy and t-butyl before nitro.

But how to add ethoxy to benzene? Maybe that's the first step.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add ethoxy via a different method. Wait, perhaps using an ethyl halide and a Lewis acid. But I thought Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a good leaving group, but that's tricky.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me switch to considering the options again. Let me look for an option where the nitration is done after adding ethoxy and t-butyl.

Looking at option A, the steps are:

i) t-butylCl/AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) H3O+ H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vi) NaOH/EtBr → O-ethylation.

So, step vi would substitute a leaving group with ethoxy. But what leaving group is present? Sulfonate groups are good leaving groups. So step iii adds a sulfonate group, which in step vi is replaced with ethoxy.

So, the substituents would be t-butyl (from step i), nitro (step ii), and sulfonate (step iii). Then, step vi replaces the sulfonate with ethoxy.

So the order of substituents would be: t-butyl, nitro, ethoxy.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So if the substituents are added as t-butyl, nitro, ethoxy, then the positions would need to be 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro), and 1 (ethoxy). Let me see.

First, benzene → t-butyl group added (step i).

Now, t-butyl is at position 1 (assuming). Then, nitration (step ii) → adds nitro at position 2 (ortho to t-butyl). Now, substituents at 1 (t-butyl) and 2 (nitro).

Then, sulfonation (step iii) → adds sulfonate group. Where? The ring now has t-butyl (1) and nitro (2). The sulfonate would be added in a position that is directed by these substituents. Nitro is deactivating, meta-directing; t-butyl is activating, ortho/para-directing.

So the possible positions for sulfonate would be influenced by both. Let's say the sulfonate adds at position 3 (meta to nitro at 2, and para to t-butyl at 1) or position 4 (para to t-butyl at 1, meta to nitro at 2). So sulfonate could be at position 3 or 4.

In step vi, the sulfonate is replaced with ethoxy. So the ethoxy would be at position 3 or 4.

In the target, ethoxy is at position 1. So this doesn't fit, unless the t-butyl is at position 2, nitro at 3, and ethoxy at 1. But according to option A's steps, the sulfonate is added after nitro, so it's not in position 1.

Hmm, perhaps this is not the correct option.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → amine at position 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl → adds t-butyl at position 2 (ortho to amine).

iv) Nitration → adds nitro group. Now, the ring has amine (1), t-butyl (2). So nitration would add nitro at position 4 (para to amine) or position 3 (ortho to t-butyl). But the target has nitro at 3.

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine. Wait, but after step iv, there's a nitro group, so maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps after step iv, the ring has nitro groups, but this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think about the correct order of substituents based on the target.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at position 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So the order in which they are added must be such that each substituent is added in the correct position relative to the others.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy ortho to tert-butyl.

3. Add nitro meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

So the steps would be:

i. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl → adds to benzene.

ii. Introduce ethoxy → ortho to tert-butyl.

iii. Nitrate → adds nitro in the correct position.

But I'm not sure how to introduce the ethoxy group. Another approach: maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is present.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me check.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → nitro to amine at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-butyl at position 2.

iv) Nitration → add nitro at position 4 (para to amine) or position 3 (ortho to t-butyl).

Wait, after step iii, the ring has amine (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2). Nitration (step iv) would be directed by the most activating group. Amine is a strong activating group, so nitration would add nitro in the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. So possible positions are 2 (taken by t-butyl), 4, or 6.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is ortho to t-butyl at 2 and meta to amine at 1. So perhaps the nitro is added in position 3, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the order in option D doesn't lead to the correct product.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the steps in option D more carefully.

Option D steps:

1. Nitration → benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl is added. Aniline is ortho/para-directing, so t-butyl could go to position 2 (ortho to amine) or 4 (para to amine).

4. Nitration → nitro group added. Aniline is activating, so nitro would go ortho or para. But the ring now has amine (1) and t-butyl (2 or 4). Let's say t-butyl is at 2. Then, nitration would add nitro at position 4 (para to amine) or position 3 (ortho to t-butyl).

If nitro is added at 3, then the substituents are 1 (amine), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro). Then, in step v, NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of amine → N2+Cl-.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Then, step vii: dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol?

Wait, after diazotization, if you hydrolyze with H2O and H+ (step viii), you would form a phenol. So substituting the amine with a hydroxyl group.

Then, step ix: NaOH/EtBr → O-ethylation. So the hydroxyl group would be replaced with ethoxy.

So let's track the substituents:

1. After nitration (i): nitro at 1.

2. Reduction (ii): amine at 1.

3. Friedel-Crafts (iii): t-butyl at 2 (ortho to amine).

4. Nitration (iv): nitro at 3 (ortho to t-butyl at 2).

5. Diazotization (v): amine at 1 → N2+Cl-.

6. Sulfonation (vi): sulfonate added. Where?

The ring now has N2+Cl- (position 1), t-butyl (2), nitro (3).

Sulfonate would be added where?

The directing effects: the nitro group is deactivating, meta-directing; t-butyl is activating, ortho/para; and the diazonium group is deactivating, meta-directing.

So the available positions would be 4,5,6.

Suppose sulfonate is added at position 4.

Then, step vii: dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol → OH at 1.

Step viii: H3O+, H2O, heat → maybe hydrolysis of sulfonate? Not sure.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → O-ethylation → ethoxy replaces the leaving group (like if there's a good leaving group like sulfonate).

So after step ix, ethoxy is added at position 4.

But the target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So this doesn't fit. So perhaps option D isn't correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to think of the steps in each option and see which one logically leads to the target.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts with t-butyl → adds t-butyl at 1.

ii) Nitration → nitro adds at 2 (ortho to t-butyl).

iii) Sulfonation → adds sulfonate at 3 (meta to nitro, ortho to t-butyl).

iv) Diazotization → where is the amino group coming from? Oh wait, option A doesn't have a reduction step before this. So perhaps the nitro isn't reduced. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction after a leaving group is present. So if the ring has a good leaving group, like a sulfonate, then it can be replaced with ethoxy.

Looking at option A's steps:

After steps i, ii, iii, the substituents are t-butyl (1), nitro (2), sulfonate (3).

Then, step iv: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But where is the amine? Unless there's an amine present, I'm not sure how this step would proceed.

Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the correct option is D. Because the steps involve adding the substituents in an order that allows their correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro. But how to introduce ethoxy?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a leaving group is introduced. For example, introducing a tosyl group (good leaving group) then substituting with ethoxide.

But in that case, the steps would involve tosylation, then O-ethylation.

Looking back, option A includes sulfonation as step iii, which would add a sulfonate group, which is a good leaving group. Then, step vi is O-ethylation with NaOH and EtBr, which would substitute the sulfonate with ethoxy.

So, option A's steps would be:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro.

3. Sulfonate → SO3H.

4. Diazotization → where is the amine coming from? Unless it's from a previous nitro group, which was reduced.

Wait, perhaps step iv in option A is diazotization of an amine group. But where would that amine come from? Unless step ii added nitro, which was then reduced.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Because after the steps, the substituents would be arranged correctly.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the substituent order.

The target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

The correct order of addition would be ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro. But since ethoxy is difficult to add directly, perhaps it's added last through a substitution.

Looking at option D, the steps are:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduction → amine at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl at 2.

iv) Nitration → nitro at 3.

v) Diazotization → N2+ at 1.

vi) Sulfonation → SO3H at 4.

vii) Dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis of diazonium to OH at 1.

viii) H3O+ H2O/Heat → maybe nothing.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → O-ethylation → ethoxy at 1.

So after all steps, substituents are:

1: ethoxy

2: t-butyl

3: nitro

Which matches the target.

So option D would give the correct product.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds the tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, which would likely be ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonate group, which is a good leaving group.
4. **Step iv**: Diazotization requires an amine group, but no reduction step is present to convert the nitro group to an amine.
5. **Step vi**: NaOH and EtBr would replace the sulfonate group with an ethoxy group.
6. However, the sequence does not lead to the correct positions of the substituents in the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
3. **Step iii**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.
4. **Step iv**: Another nitration step is unlikely to yield the correct product, as the target molecule has only one nitro group.
5. This sequence does not align with the desired substituent positions.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonate group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
4. **Step iv**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.
5. Subsequent steps involve diazotization, nitration, and sulfonation, but the sequence does not lead to the correct arrangement of substituents in the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group ortho to the amine.
4. **Step iv**: Nitration adds a nitro group at position 3, ortho to the tert-butyl group.
5. **Step v**: Diazotization converts the amine to a diazonium salt.
6. **Step vi**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonate group.
7. **Step vii**: Dilute H2SO4 hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
8. **Step ix**: NaOH and EtBr replace the hydroxyl group with an ethoxy group.

This sequence results in the correct substituent positions: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The steps ensure that the substituents are added in the correct order and positions to match the target molecule.
