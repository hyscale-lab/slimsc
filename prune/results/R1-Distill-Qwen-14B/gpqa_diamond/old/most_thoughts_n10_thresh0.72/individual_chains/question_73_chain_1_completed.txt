Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity. Oh right, because at high speeds, the rules change.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, I think the first part is about finding the relative speed between them, and the second part is about the total energy.

Wait, but relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two velocities. I remember the formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. So, let me write that down.

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So their speeds are in the same direction. The relative speed should be the speed of one as seen from the other. Let me plug into the formula.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2)).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c. Hmm, around 0.143c. Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel=0.14c. So that could be correct.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. I think the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let me compute the energy for each.

First astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)c² / c²) = 1/sqrt(1-0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(4/3)=approx 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². Hmm, so approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B is 4.96, which is lower. So option C would be correct if both the relative speed and energy match.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.

For gamma1: 0.6c speed.

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36)=1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc². Correct.

Gamma2: 0.5c.

1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. So 1/0.866≈1.1547.

E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.4641 m c². So adding 2.5 and 3.4641 gives 5.9641 mc², which is about 5.96 mc².

So the total energy is about 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, that's option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but what about the center of momentum frame? Oh, no, because the question asks for the total energy of the system, which would be the sum of their energies in the same frame. Because in the same frame, each has their own energy, so sum them.

Alternatively, if the frame is moving, but the problem doesn't specify. No, the question is about the total energy of the system as observed from the same frame where each is moving. So I think the calculation is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \(0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.143c
\]

This rounds to \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
- Mass: \(2m\), Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
- Mass: \(3m\), Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

This rounds to \(E_{\text{total}} = 5.96mc^2\).

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E = 5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
