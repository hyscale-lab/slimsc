Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both have the same albedo, so that part is the same for both. So I can ignore albedo in my calculations.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_planet = T_star * ( ( L_star / (16πσ) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - A) / ( (1 + e cos θ) ) ) )^(1/4) * ( ( R_star ) / (2 D) )^(-1/2) ), but wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Oh right, the simplified version when the orbit is circular and we're considering the effective temperature, the formula is T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 D) ), but wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4π R_*^2 σ T_*^4. For the planet, equilibrium temperature would relate to the star's flux at the planet's distance. The formula is T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance. Because the flux from the star at distance a is F = L/(4π a²) = (σ T_*^4 R_*² )/( a² ). So F = (σ T_*^4 R_*² )/( a² ). Then the planet absorbs (1 - A) F, and because of the balance between absorbed energy and emitted, F*(1-A) = σ T_p^4. So substituting F, we get (σ T_*^4 R_*² )/( a² ) (1 - A) ) = σ T_p^4. Canceling σ, then T_p^4 = (T_*^4 R_*^2 (1 - A)) / a². So T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* ) / sqrt(a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). But since A is the same for both planets, we can ignore that for the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature depends on sqrt(R_*) / sqrt(a), multiplied by T_*. So the ratio T1/T2 would be ( (sqrt(R_*/a1) ) / (sqrt(R_*/a2) ) ) ) * (T_* same for both). Wait, no, because R_* is the same for both planets, right? Because both are orbiting the same star. So R_* is same, so sqrt(R_*) cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because T_p is proportional to sqrt(R_* / a). So T_p ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So I need to find a1 and a2.

Wait, but how do I find the orbital distances a1 and a2? The question gives us information from both the transit and radial velocity methods. Each method provides some data.

For the transit method, the main thing is the depth of the transit, which relates to the planet's size relative to the star. The depth is (Rp / R_*)^2. But I don't think that's directly given here. The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and the star's mass. Oh right, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance.

Wait, in the question, both planets induce a Doppler shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Hmm. The RV method measures the Doppler shift (K), which is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / (c) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to think about the RV semi-amplitude formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ] 

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, and sin i is approximately 1 (edge-on orbit for transiting planets). So K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but another way to express K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the relationship between K, planet mass, and orbital period. Alternatively, perhaps we can relate the semi-amplitude K to the orbital distance a using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M_star + M_planet)). Since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to P² ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_star )

So a³ = G M_star P²/(4 π² )

But how does this connect with K?

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_planet) / (c) )^(1/3) * (1/( (M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, perhaps we can approximate K as proportional to (M_planet / M_star²) )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) ). Hmm, but perhaps using the formula:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i)/( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / ( M_star^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Let me see, perhaps I can find the ratio of K1 to K2 and then relate it to the parameters of the planets.

The question says that the shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So K1 = 0.03 Å and K2 = 0.04 Å. Hmm, but wait, these are shifts in the forbidden line's wavelength. So the RV semi-amplitude K is in velocity units, not wavelength shift. Hmm, perhaps I need to relate the Doppler shift in wavelength to velocity.

The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So the velocity K is related to Δλ as K = (Δλ) / λ * c.

Wait, the forbidden line is at [OI] 6300 Å. So λ = 6300 Å.

So for Planet1, K1 = (0.03 Å) / (6300 Å) ) * c.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 Å) / (6300 Å) ) * c.

So K1 = (0.03 / 6300 ) * c = (3e-5) * c.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c ≈ (6.33e-6 ) * c.

Wait, let me compute those:

For Planet1: K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e-3 = wait, no. Let me compute 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e-3? Wait, 0.03 is 3e-2, 6300 is 6.3e3. So 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3 / 6.3) ) * 1e-5 = approximately 0.476 * 1e-5 = 4.76e-6.

Wait, 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6300) = 0.00047619 = 4.7619e-4. Oh wait, I think I miscalculated exponents. 0.03 is 3e-2, 6300 is 6.3e3. So 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3 / 6.3) ) * 1e-5 = 0.47619 * 1e-5 = 4.7619e-6.

So K1 = 4.7619e-6 * c.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c = (4e-2) / (6.3e3) = 4/(6.3e5) ) = 6.349e-6 * c.

Wait, 0.04 is 4e-2. 4e-2 / 6.3e3 = (4 / 6300 ) = approx 0.0006349, which is 6.349e-4. Wait, no, 4e-2 is 0.04, 6.3e3 is 6300. So 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-2 / 6.3e3 = (4/6.3) * 1e-5 = approx 0.6349 * 1e-5 = 6.349e-6.

So K1 = 4.76e-6 c, K2 = 6.35e-6 c.

Wait, but perhaps the exact values won't matter because we might be able to find the ratio K2/K1.

So K2/K1 = (6.35e-6) / (4.76e-6) ) ≈ 1.333. Hmm, approximately 4/3, 1.333.

So K2 is about 1.333 times K1.

Now, the question is, how does K relate to the orbital distance a? Because from K and the mass, we can find a.

We have the formula for K:

K = ( (G * M_planet )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * (2π/(c))^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. From the RV method, K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period P. But P is connected to a via Kepler's third law. So perhaps, if I can find the ratio of the periods P1 and P2, I can find the ratio of the distances a1 and a2.

Alternatively, using the fact that K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^2 )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But also from Kepler's law, P² = (4π²/G M_star) a³.

So P = (4π² a³/(G M_star) )^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = (4π² a³/(G M_star) )^(1/6 )

Wait, putting this into the K equation:

K = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (4 π² a³/(G M_s)) )^(1/6 ) ) ) * (2π/(c))^(1/3) )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to express K in terms of a.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler formula that relates K with a.

I found that K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_s )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M_s ) 

So P^(1/3) = (4 π² a³/(G M_s ))^(1/6 ) 

So 1/P^(1/3) = (G M_s/(4 π² a³ ))^(1/6 ) 

Substituting into K:

K = [ (G M_p )^(1/3) / (M_s^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ (1/(1 + M_p/M_s )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (G M_s/(4 π² a³ ))^(1/6 ) ]

Hmm, let's combine terms. Let me write each term as exponents.

= (G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) )/( M_s^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_s )^(-1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) M_s^(1/6) )/( (4 π² )^(1/6) a^(3/6) ) )

Wait, simplifying exponents:

G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) = G^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2)

M_p^(1/3)

M_s^(-2/3) * M_s^(1/6) = M_s^(-2/3 + 1/6 ) = M_s^(-1/2 )

(4 π² )^(-1/6 )

a^(-3/6 ) = a^(-1/2 )

Putting it all together:

K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_s^(1/2) ) ) * (1 + M_p/M_s )^(-1/3) ) * (4 π² )^(-1/6) * a^(-1/2 )

Wait, that's getting a bit messy, but perhaps we can factor out some constants.

But perhaps it's easier to take the ratio K1/K2 in terms of a1 and a2.

Let me write K1 and K2 in terms of their parameters.

K = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_s )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But from Kepler's law, P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M_s ), so P = sqrt(4 π² a³/(G M_s )) )

So P^(1/3) = [4 π² a³/(G M_s ) ]^(1/6 )

So 1/P^(1/3) = [ G M_s / (4 π² a³ ) ]^(1/6 )

Putting this back into K:

K = (G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) )/( M_s^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_s )^(1/3) ) ) * (G^(1/6) M_s^(1/6) )/( (4 π² )^(1/6) a^(3/6) ) )

Combine the exponents:

G^(1/3 +1/6 ) = G^(1/2 )

M_p^(1/3 )

M_s^(-2/3 + 1/6 ) = M_s^(-1/2 )

(4 π² )^(-1/6 )

a^(-1/2 )

So K = (G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) )/( M_s^(1/2) ) ) * (1 + M_p/M_s )^(-1/3) ) * (4 π² )^(-1/6 ) * a^(-1/2 )

Wait, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps when taking the ratio K1/K2, some terms will cancel.

Let me write expressions for K1 and K2.

K1 = [ G^(1/2) M_p1^(1/3) ] / [ M_s^(1/2) (1 + M_p1/M_s )^(1/3) ) ] * (4 π² )^(-1/6 ) * a1^(-1/2 )

Same for K2:

K2 = [ G^(1/2) M_p2^(1/3) ] / [ M_s^(1/2) (1 + M_p2/M_s )^(1/3) ) ] * (4 π² )^(-1/6 ) * a2^(-1/2 )

Now, take the ratio K2/K1:

(K2/K1) = [ (M_p2/M_p1)^(1/3) ] / [ (1 + M_p2/M_s )^(1/3) / (1 + M_p1/M_s )^(1/3) ) ] * [ a2^(-1/2) / a1^(-1/2) ]

Simplify each part:

= (M_p2/M_p1)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p1/M_s )^(1/3) / (1 + M_p2/M_s )^(1/3) ) * (a1/a2 )^(1/2 )

But since M_p1 and M_p2 are much less than M_s, we can approximate the denominators as 1 + (M_p/M_s) ≈ 1. So (1 + M_p1/M_s ) ≈ 1, same for M_p2. So the ratio becomes approximately:

(K2/K1) ≈ (M_p2/M_p1)^(1/3) * (a1/a2 )^(1/2 )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's a good approximation. Maybe I should proceed without this approximation.

But let's proceed for now. Let me plug in the numbers.

So, K2/K1 = (M_p2 / M_p1 )^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_p1/M_s ) / (1 + M_p2/M_s ) )^(1/3 ) * (a1/a2 )^(1/2 )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, M_p/M_s is small. M_s is 1.5 solar masses. Let's compute M_p1 / M_s:

M_p1 = 7 Earth masses. M_earth is about 0.00315 solar masses. So 7 * 0.00315 = ~0.022 solar masses. So M_p1/M_s = 0.022 / 1.5 ≈ 0.0147.

Similarly, M_p2 =5 Earth masses. 5 * 0.00315 = 0.01575 solar masses. M_p2/M_s = 0.01575 / 1.5 ≈ 0.0105.

So (1 + M_p1/M_s ) ≈ 1.0147, (1 + M_p2/M_s ) ≈ 1.0105.

So (1.0147/1.0105 )^(1/3) ≈ (1.0041 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.00137.

So the ratio becomes approximately:

(K2/K1 ) ≈ (5/7 )^(1/3) * (1.00137 ) * (a1/a2 )^(1/2 )

We have K2/K1 as approximately 1.333, as computed earlier (since K2 is 0.04 and K1 is 0.03, so K2/K1 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333).

So,

1.333 ≈ (5/7 )^(1/3) * 1.00137 * (a1/a2 )^(1/2 )

Compute (5/7 )^(1/3 ). 5/7 is approximately 0.7143. Cube root of 0.7143 is about 0.896.

So,

1.333 ≈ 0.896 * 1.00137 * (a1/a2 )^(1/2 )

Multiply 0.896 * 1.00137 ≈ 0.897.

So,

1.333 ≈ 0.897 * (a1/a2 )^(1/2 )

Divide both sides by 0.897: 1.333 / 0.897 ≈ 1.486 ≈ (a1/a2 )^(1/2 )

So,

(a1/a2 )^(1/2 ) ≈ 1.486 → a1/a2 ≈ (1.486 )² ≈ 2.21.

So a1 ≈ 2.21 a2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's accurate enough. Let me compute more precisely.

Wait, let me compute 0.896 * 1.00137 ≈ 0.896 * 1.00137.

0.896 * 1 = 0.896; 0.896 * 0.00137 ≈ 0.001228. So total ≈ 0.897228.

So 1.333 / 0.897228 ≈ approximately 1.486.

So (a1/a2 )^0.5 = 1.486 → a1/a2 = (1.486)^2 ≈ 2.21.

Now, since the equilibrium temperature T_p is proportional to sqrt( R_* / a ), as discussed earlier, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_* / a1 ) / ( R_* / a2 ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) )

Because T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* ) / sqrt(a )

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 ) )

We have a1/a2 ≈ 2.21, so sqrt( a1/a2 ) ≈ sqrt(2.21 ) ≈ 1.486. So T1/T2 = 1 / 1.486 ≈ 0.673.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, option A is ~0.98, D is ~1.05, B is ~1.30.

Hmm, 0.67 isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me go back.

Wait, the ratio I found was a1/a2 ≈2.21, so a2/a1≈0.4528.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.4528 ) ≈ 0.6727.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps my approach has a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K formula. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude formula, which can be written as:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1/( c ) ) * ( (2π ) / P )^(1/3) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck here, perhaps I should approach the problem differently.

Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (27.4 m/s ) * (M_p sin i ) ) / ( (M_s + M_p )^(1/3) ) * (P/yr )^( -1/3 ) )

Wait, perhaps using the formula where K is proportional to (M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_s )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should think of the ratio K2/K1.

Earlier, I thought that K2/K1 is 0.04/0.03 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

But I used wavelength shifts to get K = (Δλ/λ) c. So for Planet1, K1 = (0.03 / 6300 ) * c, and for Planet2, K2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c. So K2= (4/3) K1. So K2/K1=4/3.

So let me proceed with that.

So K2/K1=4/3.

Now, from the RV semi-amplitude formula, the ratio is:

K2/K1 = [ ( M_p2 / (M_s + M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * (1/P2 )^(1/3) ) ] / [ ( M_p1 / ( M_s + M_p1 )^(1/3) ) * (1/P1 )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify:

K2/K1 = ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( (M_s + M_p1 )^(1/3) / (M_s + M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) )

But since M_p1 and M_p2 are much smaller than M_s, (M_s + M_p ) ≈ M_s, so:

K2/K1 ≈ ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( (M_s )^(1/3) / (M_s )^(1/3) ) * ( P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) )

So,

K2/K1 ≈ ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Which can be rewritten as:

(4/3 ) ≈ (5/7 ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Because M_p2 is 5 Earth masses, M_p1 is 7 Earth masses.

So,

(4/3 ) ≈ (5/7 ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Solve for (P1/P2 )^(1/3 ):

(P1/P2 )^(1/3 ) = (4/3 ) * (7/5 ) ) = (4*7)/(3*5 ) ) = 28/15 ≈1.8667.

Cube both sides:

P1/P2 = (28/15 )^3 ≈ (1.8667 )^3 ≈ 6.500.

So P1 = 6.5 P2.

Now, using Kepler's third law, which states that P² ∝ a³ / M_s, where M_s is the mass of the star.

For two planets, P1² / P2² = (a1³ / M_s ) / ( a2³ / M_s ) ) → P1² / P2² = a1³ / a2³.

So,

(P1/P2 )^2 = (a1³/a2³ )

But from earlier, P1/P2 ≈6.5.

So,

(6.5 )^2 = (a1/a2 )^3 → 42.25 = (a1/a2 )^3 → a1/a2 = (42.25 )^(1/3 )

Compute cube root of 42.25: 3³=27, 4³=64. So 3.5³=42.875. Close to 42.25. So approximately 3.5.

So a1/a2 ≈ 3.5 → a2/a1 ≈ 0.2857.

Now, the equilibrium temperature is:

T_p ∝ T_* * sqrt( R_* / a )

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( R_* / a1 ) / sqrt( R_* / a2 ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because R_* is same for both.

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1 / (a1/a2 ) ) ) = 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )

We have a1/a2 ≈3.5, so sqrt(3.5 ) ≈1.87. So T1/T2 =1/1.87≈0.534.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature is proportional to:

\[
T_p \propto T_* \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{a}}
\]

where \(T_*\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_*\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets orbit the same star, \(T_*\) and \(R_*\) are constant, so the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) can be determined using the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude data. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), the star's mass \(M_s\), and the orbital period \(P\) by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{(M_s)^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), the ratio of \(K_2\) to \(K_1\) is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{0.04}{0.03} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.333
\]

Using the RV formula, the ratio of \(K_2\) to \(K_1\) can also be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} \propto \frac{M_p2 / M_p1}{(P_1 / P_2)^{1/3}}
\]

Substituting \(M_p1 = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\) and \(M_p2 = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\), we find:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} \propto \frac{5/7}{(P_1 / P_2)^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging for \((P_1 / P_2)^{1/3}\):

\[
(P_1 / P_2)^{1/3} = \frac{5}{7} \cdot \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{15}{28} \approx 0.5357
\]

Cubing both sides gives:

\[
P_1 / P_2 = (0.5357)^3 \approx 0.154
\]

From Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M_s\), so:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3}
\]

Substituting \(P_1 / P_2 \approx 0.154\):

\[
\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 \implies (0.154)^2 = \left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3
\]

\[
0.0237 = \left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 \implies \frac{a_1}{a_2} = (0.0237)^{1/3} \approx 0.288
\]

Finally, substituting \(\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 0.288\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{0.288}} \approx \sqrt{3.472} \approx 1.86
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to option **C**.
