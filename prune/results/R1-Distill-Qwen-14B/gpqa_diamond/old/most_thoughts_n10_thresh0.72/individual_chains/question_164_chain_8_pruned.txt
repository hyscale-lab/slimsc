Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of the binary system. Then, looking at their radial velocity (RV) variations, system_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s, while system_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, considering the mass is the sum of both stars.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The radial velocity semi-amplitude is related to the mass ratio and the orbital period. Oh wait, right, the formula involves the mass function, which depends on the masses of the stars, their orbital period, and the eccentricity. But since the problem doesn't mention eccentricity, maybe we can assume it's negligible or circular orbits (e=0).

Wait, the formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * sin(i)) / (1 + q)

Where q is the mass ratio (q = M2/M1), and v is the systemic velocity. But wait, I might be mixing up some terms here. Alternatively, each star's velocity is related to the mass of the other. Oh wait, in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if one star is more massive, it moves slower.

Wait, more accurately, the mass function comes into play. The mass function for each star is given by:

f(m) = (M^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + q)^2 )

But maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, for a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each star is given by:

K1 = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (P (1 + q))^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 =
