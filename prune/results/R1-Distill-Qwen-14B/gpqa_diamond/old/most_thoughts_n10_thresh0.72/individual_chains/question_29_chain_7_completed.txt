Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate the compound by using EMS mutagenesis.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon. So, I need to look for a mutation that would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough that the compound isn't made.

Looking at the options:

The intact gene is given as a reference. Each mutant shows changes in the first exon area. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Intact gene sequence (exon 1 at the beginning, maybe):
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene. Let's see where the changes are. The first part is ATGTTTCTCG... in the intact. For Mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACGCTGG... Wait, let me line them up.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1:
ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact changes. Let me write each position.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for insertions, deletions, or changes that cause frame shifts or stop codons.

Mutant 1: Let's see, the first few bases:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Looking at the first part:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGG...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGG...

So, the third position is T in intact, but in Mutant1, is it a T or a C?

Wait, perhaps I should compare the sequences. Let me see each position.

Intact:
Positions:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
26-28: GAA
... etc.

Mutant1's sequence:

1-3: ATG (same)
4-6: TCT (intact is TTT) so T->C at position 4?
Then 7-9: TAC (intact is CTC)
10-12: GCT (same as intact)
13-15: GGT (same)
16-18: ACT (same)
19-21: TCT (same)
22-24: GTG (same)
25-27: GAT (same)
26-28: GAA (same)
Hmm, so in Mutant1, the first few changes are in positions 4, 7. Let's see, how does this affect the amino acids?

Original: pos 4-6 is TTT, which is Phe. In Mutant1, TCT is Ser. So Phe becomes Ser. Then, positions 7-9 in intact: CTC (Leu). In Mutant1: TAC, which is Tyr. So the second change is Leu to Tyr.

Hmm, but this doesn't introduce a stop codon. So the protein would just have some amino acid changes. Not a frameshift, so the rest of the exons would be read correctly.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact:

Intact starts same up to some point.

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGG...

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGG...

So, position 4: T becomes C? Let me see:

Positions 4-6 in Mutant2: TCT.

In intact, it's TTT. So at position 4, T->C.

Positions 7-9 in Mutant2: AAG (intact was CTC). So, AAG is Lys, and CTC was Leu. So that's a change from Leu to Lys.

Then positions 10-12: GCT (same as intact). Wait, but the original in intact is GCT; same here. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for where the mutations are. Let's see: the initial part of the gene is an open reading frame. The first exon is likely the start, so any change could affect the protein.

Looking at all the mutants, I'm looking for a frame shift or a premature stop codon.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Hmm. Let's see:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...

So, let's compare. Positions 4-6: TTT in intact (positions 4-6), but in Mutant3, it's TTT (same?), wait, let me line up.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare each base:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT TCA...

Wait, so in the intact gene, after TTT comes CTC. In mutant3, after TTT, it's TAC. So positions 7-9: TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, position 13-15: GGT same, but position 16-18: TCA (Ser) instead of ACT (Thr). So, this changes Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC), and then Thr (ACT) to Ser (TCA). Would that cause a frame shift? No, because it's a substitution, not an insertion or deletion. So the reading frame remains the same. So the protein would have some amino acid changes, but not a stop codon.

Wait, but looking further down, I see in Mutant3: after the TCA, it's GTG (same as intact). So no frame shift.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact:

Intact: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant4: ...GCTACTTCTGT...

Wait, so in intact, after GCT comes GGT. In Mutant4, after GCT is ACT. Let me see:

Intact:
Positions 10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT

Mutant4:
Positions 10-12: GCT same.
13-15: ACT (instead of GGT) → Thr instead of Gly.
16-18: TCT (instead of ACT) → Ser instead of Thr?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the sequences:

Intact: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, so the 13-15 position in intact is GGT (Gly), but in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So at position 13, G becomes A.

Hmm, but that's substitution, not a frameshift. So the rest of the exons would remain in the same reading frame.

Wait, but perhaps a more critical point is whether any of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA).

Looking at the sequences:

In the intact gene, the last part shown is ...TGTCGT…TGA-3’. The TGA is the stop codon at the end.

So, looking at the mutants, whether any have a TGA or other stop codon earlier.

Looking at each mutant's end:

Mutant1: ...GTCGC…TGA. So the stop is at the same place. So no early stop.

Mutant2: same.

Mutant3: same.

Mutant4: ...ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Wait, in Mutant4, does the sequence have a TGA somewhere else?

Wait, in Mutant4's sequence: ...TGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ So the TGA occurs in the middle, perhaps as part of a codon.

Wait, let's look closely.

In Mutant4: ...TGTCGT... becomes ...TGA... ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me look:

Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, in the middle, there's 'TGA' as part of the sequence. Let me check the exact position.

So the full sequence of Mutant4 is:

...ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT… TGA...

Wait, within the coding sequence, the TGA appears in the middle. So the stop codon is in the middle of the gene. That would cause a premature stop, truncating the protein.

So, in Mutant4, the gene has a TGA in the middle, which would terminate translation early. So the protein would be shorter than normal. If the anti-nutritional compound is made by this gene's protein, perhaps truncating it would disrupt the function. So that's a good candidate for eliminating the compound.

Looking back to the options, the question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. So a mutation causing a premature stop would likely result in a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at each option:

Option D is Mutant4. The TGA appears in the middle, so that introduces a premature stop.

Wait, but let me check: in the intact gene, the TGA is at the end. So in Mutant4, does the TGA occur earlier?

Yes, because in the sequence, it says ...TGAACAT... So that would be in the middle.

Wait, let me parse the sequence:

Mutant4: ...ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT… TGA …

Wait, no, in the given sequences:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the part after the GTG:

In intact, after GTG is GAT GAA...

In Mutant4, after GTG is GAT GAA (same as intact?), but wait, perhaps not.

Wait, the exact sequence:

Intact: ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ Wait, no, the earlier part is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express:

Intact gene:

... TGT CGT ... TGA ...

Mutant4's sequence:

... TGT CGT ... TGA (so the same as the end?), but wait, does the TGA occur earlier?

Wait, in the mutant4, the sequence is:

... GCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA ...

So the TGA is at the end, same as the intact. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, looking at the given sequences:

Intact: ... TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant4: ... TGT CGT ... TGA

Wait, that's the same. So why the confusion earlier?

Oh, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check the sequence again.

Wait, the intact gene's exon 1 starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, so the first part is different, but the end is same.

Hmm, so in Mutant4, the sequence is slightly altered in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the TGA is not introduced in the middle. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me reevaluate. Are any of the mutants introducing a TGA (stop codon) earlier in the sequence?

Looking again:

Mutant1: ... TGT CGC ... → no TGA introduced.

Mutant2: ... TGT CGC ... → same.

Mutant3: ... TGT CGT ... → same as intact.

Mutant4: ... TGT CGT ... → same.

Wait, so perhaps none of the mutants have an introduced TGA in the middle? Then what's the issue.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a frameshift, which would cause a completely different downstream sequence and possibly introduce a stop codon.

Let me check each mutant for insertions or deletions.

Mutant1: Comparing the intact gene and mutant1 sequences, I don't see any insertions or deletions—only substitutions. So the reading frame remains the same.

Mutant2: Same as above, substitutions only.

Mutant3: Substitutions only.

Mutant4: Let's see the sequences again.

Intact: ...TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

Mutant4: ...TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

Wait, that's the same as the intact. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps looking at the entire sequence, Mutant4 has a different part. Let me see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, so in Mutant4, after the ATG, the next few changes are:

Positions 4-6: TTT (same as intact, which is TTT at positions 4-6). So that's same.

Wait, wait, no: in Mutant4, after the initial ATG, it's TTT, same as intact.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each base.

Let me line up the sequences:

Intact:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

22-24: GTG

25-27: GAT

28-30: GAA

31-33: CAT

34-36: ATT

37-39: TAT

40-42: TGT

43-45: CGT

... then TGA.

Mutant4:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: TAC → changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr)

10-12: GCT (same)

13-15: ACT → changed from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr)

16-18: TCT → changed from ACT (Thr) to TCT (Ser)

22-24: GTG (same)

25-27: GAT (same)

28-30: GAA (same)

31-33: CAT (same)

34-36: ATT (same)

37-39: TAT (same)

40-42: TGT (same)

43-45: CGT (same)

... then TGA.

So, Mutant4 has substitutions at positions 7-9, 13-15, 16-18.

No insertions or deletions, so no frameshift.

So, looking for a stop codon, but I don't see any introduced. So maybe the correct approach is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, perhaps by a nonsense mutation (early stop codon).

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I didn't see any introduced TGA in the middle. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mutation that disrupts the start codon. The start is ATG. If it's mutated, the protein can't start.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: ATG is same.

Mutant2: same.

Mutant3: same.

Mutant4: same.

So, no disruption of the start codon.

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to find a mutation that causes a frameshift, leading to a completely different downstream sequence and possibly an early stop codon.

Looking for insertions or deletions.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1 and others don't show any insertions or deletions; only substitutions.

So, perhaps none of them cause a frameshift, meaning the reading frame remains intact. So maybe the best bet is a mutation that changes a critical amino acid, perhaps in the active site of the enzyme, thereby inactivating the gene's product.

But without knowing which amino acids are critical, this is hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about disrupting the start codon. But all the mutants start with ATG.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again at Mutant4.

Mutant4's sequence is:

ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me see the exact positions.

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4: ...CTA GCT ACT TCTGTGG...

Wait, perhaps the middle part changes.

Wait, breaking it down:

Intact:
- CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant4:
- CTA GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, the sequence after ATG TT T:

Intact: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: CTA GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, positions 7-9: CTC → CTA → Leu → Leu? No, CTC is Leu, CTA is Leu as well. Wait, no—no, CTC is Leu, and CTA is also Leu (same codon for Leu).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me write the exact nucleotides.

Wait, the first part of the intact gene is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant4's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, let me write the exact nucleotides:

Intact (positions 1-30):

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

22-24: GTG

25-27: GAT

28-30: GAA

Mutant4 (positions 1-30):

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: TAC

10-12: GCT

13-15: ACT

16-18: TCT

22-24: GTG

25-27: GAT

28-30: GAA

So, the changes are:

7-9: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr)

13-15: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr)

16-18: ACT → TCT (Thr → Ser)

No frame shift, so no. But these substitutions could change the protein.

Would any of these lead to a nonfunctional protein? It depends on where the changes are. For example, if the changes are in a critical region, like the active site of the enzyme.

But without knowing the gene's structure, perhaps the best bet is a mutation that introduces a stop codon early in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The question asks which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the gene is responsible for the compound, and we want to disrupt it.

Mutant4's sequence: in the middle, after the initial part, the sequence is:

ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Which is in frame, same as the intact.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the question says that the gene consists of five exons and four introns. The changes all occur in the first exon.

If the first exon is the promoter region or the start, perhaps a mutation that disrupts the promoter would stop transcription. But the question says they found mutations in the target gene's sequence. So it's probably in the coding region.

Wait, maybe I should look for a nonsense mutation, a TGA (or TAG, TAA) codon somewhere in the middle, causing the mRNA to be terminated prematurely. That would produce a truncated protein, which may not function.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: ... TGT CGC ... → no TGA in the middle.

Mutant2: same.

Mutant3: same.

Mutant4: same as the intact in the stop codon's position. Wait, but in Mutant4, the sequence is:

...ATTTATTGTCGT... TGA...

So the TGA is at the end, same as the intact. So, no early stop.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequences. Are any of the mutations causing a change in the reading frame, leading to a premature stop?

Looking at all the mutants:

Mutant1: Changes at positions 4-6 (TCT), 7-9 (TAC). So, same frame.

Mutant2: Changes at positions 4-6 (TCT), 7-9 (AAG). Same frame.

Mutant3: Changes at positions 7-9 (TAC), 16-18 (TCA). Same frame.

Mutant4: Changes at 7-9 (TAC), 13-15 (ACT), 16-18 (TCT). Same frame.

So, no frame shifts. Therefore, no early stop codon because the frame isn't shifted. So perhaps the only way is to find a substitution that introduces a stop codon.

Looking for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the middle.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant4's sequence in the middle:

...ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT... TGA...

Wait, no TGA in the middle. So none of the mutants have a TGA in the middle. That suggests that none of them have a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the only way is to find a mutation that disrupts the start codon, but all have ATG.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution that creates a stop codon.

Looking for any of the codons being TGA, TAG, TAA.

In the middle of any of the mutants:

Mutant1: ...CGC... → CGC is Arg.

Mutant2: ...CGC... → same.

Mutant3: ...CGT... → same as intact (CGT is Arg).

Mutant4: ...CGT... same.

Hmm, none of them have a TGA in the middle.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check the exact sequences again.

Wait, the question states that the changes are at the beginning of the first exon. So perhaps the mutation is in the beginning, affecting the start codon or the initiation site.

But all the mutants have ATG as the start.

Wait, perhaps a mutation that causes a frameshift would be better. But in the given sequences, only substitutions are present, no insertions or deletions.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts a critical region of the gene.

But without knowing the structure, perhaps the only way is to look for the presence of a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine Mutant4.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it down:

After the initial ATG, the sequence is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT.

Wait, perhaps in the middle, there's a TGA codon.

Wait, in the third part, after GTG:

Intact: ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4: ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, so same, so TGA is at the end.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps looking for a deletion or insertion that shifts the frame.

But in the given sequences, all the mutants only have substitutions.

So, none have a frameshift.

Thus, perhaps the best bet is a substitution that introduces a stop codon.

But I don't see any in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look for any of the codons being a stop.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: The first few codons are:

ATG (M), TCT (S), TAC (Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (R), GAT (D), GAA (E), etc.

No stop codon.

Mutant2:

ATG (M), TCT (S), AAG (K), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (R), GAT (D), GAA (E), etc.

No stop.

Mutant3:

ATG (M), TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), TCA (S), TCT (S), GTG (R), GAT (D), GAA (E), etc.

No stop.

Mutant4:

ATG (M), TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S), TCT (S), GTG (R), GAT (D), GAA (E), etc.

No stop.

So, none of the mutations introduce a stop codon in the middle. Therefore, perhaps the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function through an amino acid substitution that inactivates the enzyme. Without a frameshift or stop codon, the protein is still made but perhaps not functional.

But the question is about the best option among the four.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the anti-nutritional compound is a product of the gene, so if the gene is knocked out (nonfunctional), the compound is not produced.

If the mutation creates a premature stop, the gene is nonfunctional. So, which mutant has that?

Wait, perhaps the TGA in Mutant4 is in the middle.

Looking again:

Mutant4's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, maybe in the middle, there's a TGA.

Wait, the ...GATGAACAT... part: GAT is Asp, GAA is Glu, CAT is His.

So, GAT GAA CAT.

In Mutant4: ...GAT GAA CAT...

No TGA here.

Wait, perhaps I've been looking in the wrong place.

Wait, perhaps the sequence after TACGCTACTTCTGTG:

In Mutant4, it's GATGAACATATT.

In the intact, it's GATGAACATATT same.

Wait, no. So, perhaps there's no TGA in the middle.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function.

Option D is Mutant4.

In Mutant4, the sequence changes from GCTGGTACTTCT to GCTACTTCT.

So, that's in the middle of the exon.

But without a frameshift, the rest of the sequence is read correctly.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function through a nonsense mutation.

But I can't find any in the sequences provided.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a point. Let me think about the fact that the gene is made of exons and introns. If the mutation is in an exon, it's more likely to affect the protein.

But the mutations are in the first exon, so they are in the coding region.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation introduces a splice site, but that's less likely with EMS, which typically causes point mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon downstream, leading to a truncated protein.

But I don't see any new ATG in the sequences.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation creates a stop codon in the middle via a substitution.

Wait, let me look for any of the codons being a stop.

In Mutant4:

After the ATG, the sequence is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… TGA.

Looking at the codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), ... TGA (stop).

So the stop is at the end.

Wait, but perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence is:

... TGT CGT ... TGA ...

Which is same as the intact.

So, perhaps none of the mutations introduce an early stop. Then, the only way is to have a substitution that disrupts the gene's function.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes more of the initial exons, leading to a more disruptive effect.

But I'm not certain. Another angle: perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's splicing.

But I think the intended approach is to find a mutation that introduces a stop codon early in the coding sequence, leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, looking again at Mutant3's sequence:

Mutant3: ... TGT CGT ... TGA ...

Same as the others, so no early stop.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me try to find which mutant has a substitution that creates a stop codon.

Looking at each codon in each mutant:

Mutant1:

ATG (M), TCT (S), TAC (Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (R), GAT (D), GAA (E), CAT (H), ATT (I), TAT (Y), TGT (C), CGT (R), TGA (stop).

No early stop.

Mutant2:

ATG (M), TCT (S), AAG (K), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (R), GAT (D), GAA (E), CAT (H), ATT (I), TAT (Y), TGT (C), CGT (R), TGA (stop).

No early stop.

Mutant3:

ATG (M), TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), TCA (S), TCT (S), GTG (R), GAT (D), GAA (E), CAT (H), ATT (I), TAT (Y), TGT (C), CGT (R), TGA (stop).

No early stop.

Mutant4:

ATG (M), TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S), TCT (S), GTG (R), GAT (D), GAA (E), CAT (H), ATT (I), TAT (Y), TGT (C), CGT (R), TGA (stop).

No early stop.

Hmm. None of the mutants have a TGA, TAG, or TAA in the middle. So perhaps the intended answer is that none of them introduce a stop codon, but the question says which mutation would eliminate the compound. So perhaps the correct approach is to choose the mutation that disrupts the gene's function the most.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which changes more nucleotides in the beginning of the exon, perhaps disrupting an important region.

But without knowing which region is critical, it's hard to choose.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the one that changes a codon to a stop.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about disrupting the promoter region. But the mutations are in the coding region.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it leads to a frameshift, but I thought there was none.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check for a frameshift in Mutant4.

Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Hmm, let me count the number of nucleotides in each after the ATG.

Intact after ATG:

TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT TGA

Mutant4 after ATG:

TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT TGA

Wait, in the intact, the sequence after ATG is TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT.

In Mutant4, it's TTCTAAGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT.

Wait, perhaps I should count the nucleotides to see if there's a deletion or insertion.

Let me count:

Intact after ATG: TT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

That's 3 bases each, so 3 * 10 = 30 nucleotides before stop.

Mutant4 after ATG: TT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

Same length, 30 nucleotides.

So same length, so no frameshift.

Therefore, all the mutations are substitutions, no frameshift.

Thus, the only way to eliminate the protein is to disrupt it through substitutions that change critical amino acids.

But without knowing which part is critical, perhaps the question is pointing us to the fact that the start codon is intact, and the only way to stop the protein is through a premature stop. Since none have this, perhaps the correct answer is none of them. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in analyzing the sequences. Let me look for any TGA in the middle.

Wait, in Mutant4's sequence:

...GATGAACATATT...

Which is GAT GAA CAT ATT.

No TGA here.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking for the presence of a stop codon.

In the given sequences, all the stops are at the end. So perhaps the correct approach is to choose the mutation that changes the most critical part of the gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about disrupting the promoter, but the mutations are in the coding region.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what each option represents.

The question lists four mutants, and I have to pick which one would eliminate the compound. Presumably, the correct answer is the one that introduces a premature stop codon.

But earlier I thought none of them do that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me look again.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence in the middle:

After TACGCTACTTCTGTG, the next part is GATGAACATATT.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think:

Mutant4: ...TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Wait, in the middle, it's GGATGAACATATT.

So, the codons are:

GGT (Gly), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), ... TGA (Stop).

So no TGA in the middle.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the middle part of the first exon is altered, perhaps in a critical region.

But without knowing the gene's structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the changes cause a frameshift, but I thought it was substitution.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, but I can't assume that.

Another approach: think about the position of the mutation. The question states that the changes are at the beginning of the first exon. So, early in the gene.

If a mutation occurs early in the gene, it's more likely to disrupt the start or the initial structure.

Mutant1 has a change in the first few codons, changing Phe to Ser and Leu to Tyr.

Mutant2 changes Phe to Ser and Leu to Lys.

Mutant3 changes Leu to Tyr and Thr to Ser.

Mutant4 changes Leu to Tyr, Gly to Thr, and Thr to Ser.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has two substitutions in the same area, more likely to disrupt the gene.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: the anti-nutritional compound is made by the protein product. If the protein is not made, the compound won't be produced. So, disrupting the gene would prevent the compound.

A frameshift would likely cause a nonfunctional protein, but none have frameshifts. So, perhaps the only way is to have a mutation that introduces a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I missed that in Mutant4, the third codon is TAC, which is Tyr, not Leu as in the intact.

But that's a substitution.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, as it has the most changes in the early exons, leading to a more likely disruption.

But honestly, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: look for a mutation that creates a stop codon. For that, two consecutive T's might form a TAA or TAG.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1 has CGC at the end of the first part. No.

Mutant2 same.

Mutant3: CGT.

Mutant4: CGT.

No, no TAG or TAA.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after TACGCTACTTCTGTG is GATGAACATATT.

Which is GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), ... TGA.

No TGA in the middle.

Hmm.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the most nucleotides in the beginning of the exon, which might be important for the gene's function.

But honestly, I'm not entirely sure. Based on the given options, I think the intended answer is D) Mutant4, but I'm not 100% confident.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein product.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:
   - The intact gene sequence starts with `ATG` (the start codon) and ends with `TGA` (the stop codon). The sequence provided is:
     ```
     5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
     ```

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Changes:
     - `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser) at positions 4–6.
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr) at positions 7–9.
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. The reading frame remains intact, and the protein would likely be altered but still functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Changes:
     - `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser) at positions 4–6.
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `AAG` (Lys) at positions 7–9.
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. The reading frame remains intact, and the protein would likely still be functional.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Changes:
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr) at positions 7–9.
     - `ACT` (Thr) → `TCA` (Ser) at positions 16–18.
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. The reading frame remains intact, and the protein would likely still be functional.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Changes:
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr) at positions 7–9.
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr) at positions 13–15.
     - `ACT` (Thr) → `TCT` (Ser) at positions 16–18.
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. The reading frame remains intact, and the protein would likely still be functional.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutants introduce a frameshift or a premature stop codon (TGA, TAG, or TAA) in the middle of the sequence. However, Mutant 4 has the most changes in the beginning of the first exon, which may disrupt a critical region of the gene, leading to a nonfunctional protein. Based on the options provided, Mutant 4 is the most likely candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
