Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should form acetate ions and water.

Alright, let's break down the problem. First, they diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. I need to find the new concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh right, because when you dilute, the concentration decreases. The formula I think is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1V1)/V2.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration is done with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration mean? Oh, right, it's when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Alternatively, sometimes it's when 25% of the required volume of NaOH is added. But I think in this context, it refers to the percentage of the acid that's been titrated. So I should find out how much NaOH is needed to reach 25% of the equivalence point.

First, let's find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

The diluted acetic acid solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. So moles of CH3COOH = M * V = 0.025 * 40 = 1 mmol. Because 40 cm³ is 0.04 L, 0.025 *0.04 is 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol.

Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 1 mmol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / conc = (0.001 mol) / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, let's compute the pH at this point. At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. The situation is a buffer solution, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should be used.

First, let's find the moles of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration. The total moles of acid initially is 1 mmol. 25% of that is neutralized, so moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.75 mmol. Moles of acetate formed = 0.25 mmol.

But wait, since the reaction is 1:1, each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid, producing one mole of acetate. So yes, 25% of the acid is neutralized, so 0.25 mmol of acetate is formed, and 0.75 mmol of acetic acid remains.

But wait, the total volume now is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³). So total V = 42.5 cm³. Wait, but when dealing with concentrations in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, you can either use concentrations or keep the moles because they'll cancel when taking the ratio.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A
