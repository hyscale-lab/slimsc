Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question deals with binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and their reactions, and I need to determine the molecular weight range of A4.

Hmm, let's break down the information given.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition reaction gives A2 with a oF (I think that's the oxidation state or maybe formula) of 31.96%. Wait, maybe oF refers to the oxidation state of fluorine? Or perhaps the formula of A2? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, maybe 31.96% is the percentage composition of fluorine in A2. Because when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So let me think.

So, if A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, the fluorine in A2 would be less than in A1. Wait, but A1 is a binary compound, so it's YF_x. Let me note down:

A1 → A2 + F2

So, A1 is YF_a, and A2 is YF_b, and F2 is produced. So, when A1 decomposes, it breaks down into A2 and fluorine gas. That suggests that A2 has fewer fluorine atoms than A1. So maybe A1 is something more fluorinated than A2.

Wait, but how does the fluorine percentage come into play? Oh, the oF is 31.96%. So that's the mass percent of fluorine in A2. Let's calculate what that implies for the formula of A2.

Assuming A2 is YF_b. The molar mass of A2 would be Y's atomic weight plus b times fluorine's atomic weight (which is about 19 g/mol). The fluorine mass percent is (b*19)/(Y + b*19) ) * 100 = 31.96%.

So, (19b)/(Y + 19b) = 0.3196

Let me solve for Y:

19b = 0.3196 * Y + 0.3196 * 19b

19b - 0.3196*19b = 0.3196 Y

19b (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 Y

19b * 0.6804 = 0.3196 Y

Let me compute 19 * 0.6804 and 0.3196.

19 * 0.6804 ≈ 12.9276

So, 12.9276 b = 0.3196 Y

Divide both sides by 0.3196: (12.9276 / 0.3196) * b = Y

Calculating 12.9276 / 0.3196 ≈ 40.5.

So Y ≈ 40.5 b.

Since Y is an element, and b must be an integer (number of fluorine atoms in the formula), let's see possible b and Y values.

Wait, Y is the other element in the binary compound, so it's likely a metal. Let me think of elements around atomic weight 40.5 times b.

Wait, Y can't be that big because 40.5 * b would make Y quite heavy. Let's try small b.

If b=1: Y ≈40.5 *1=40.5. Hmm, which element is around 40? Titanium is 47.867, but that's higher. Wait, maybe Y isn't Y but another element? Wait, the problem says element Y, so maybe it's a different element. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible compounds. Let me think about known fluorinated compounds.

Another point: A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine compounds that are strong oxidizing agents include things like F2 itself, but fluorides are usually not strong oxidizers. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a highly oxidized fluoride.

Wait, another angle: when a binary compound of fluorine decomposes to another fluoride and F2, it suggests that the original compound is perhaps a higher fluoride. For example, if A1 is YF4 and A2 is YF2. But then, the fluorine percentage in A2 would be (2*19)/(Y + 38) = 31.96%.

Wait, let's plug that in. Let me assume A2 is YF2.

So, (38)/(Y +38) = 0.3196 → 38 = 0.3196 Y + 0.3196 *38.

Calculate 0.3196 *38 ≈12.1448

So, 38 - 12.1448 = 0.3196 Y → 25.8552 = 0.3196 Y → Y ≈ 25.8552 / 0.3196 ≈80.85.

Hmm, that's a very high atomic weight. Wait, but Y is an element, maybe a heavy metal. Let's see, Y ≈80.85, so that's around the atomic weight of mercury (200.59) or perhaps something else. Wait, that can't be right because 80.85 is more like lead? No, lead is about 207.2. Wait, 80 is around the atomic weight of strontium (87.62), but that's close. Alternatively, perhaps A2 is YF3.

Wait, maybe I should try different formulas. Let's try b=3.

So (3*19)/(Y + 3*19) = 0.3196 →57/(Y + 57) = 0.3196 →57 = 0.3196 Y + 0.3196 *57.

Compute 0.3196 *57 ≈18.1752

So 57 -18.1752 = 0.3196 Y →38.8248=0.3196 Y → Y ≈121.5.

Hmm, 121.5 is close to the atomic weight of iodine (126.9), but perhaps that's a stretch.

Alternatively, if A2 is YF1 (b=1), then:

(19)/(Y+19)=0.3196 →19=0.3196 Y +6.0724 →19-6.0724=0.3196 Y →12.9276=0.3196 Y →Y≈40.5.

So Y is about 40.5. That's around Zr (zirconium, ~91? No, wait, no, Zr is 91. Zirconium is too high. Wait, element with atomic weight ~40.5? Let me check periodic table.

Looking at the periodic table:

- Scandium (Sc) is ~45.

- Titanium (Ti) is 47.87.

- Vanadium (V) is 50.94.

Hmm, none near 40.5. Wait, perhaps Y is not a metal? Or maybe I'm making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that Y is a non-metal. But in binary fluorides, Y is probably a metal.

Wait, maybe Y is aluminum? No, Al is 27. Hmm, but 40.5 is higher. Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur? No, that's 32.1. Or maybe chlorine? No, that's 35.5.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe A2 is not YF_b but something else, like YF_b with a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF5, and when it decomposes, it produces YF3 and F2. Let's see:

YF5 → YF3 + F2.

What's the fluorine percentage in YF3?

So, fluorine mass percent is (3*19)/(Y + 3*19) = 57/(Y+57) = 31.96%.

So 57/(Y+57) = 0.3196 → same as before → Y ≈121.5.

Wait, but Y would be about 121.5. Let me think about that. 121.5 is close to the atomic weight of Te (tellurium, ~127.6). Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, but let's think about known fluorine compounds. Fluorine tends to form +1, -1 oxidation states. So binary compounds are YF, YF2, YF3, etc.

Wait, another point: The problem says that A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So A3 is another binary compound of Y and F. So perhaps A3 is YF, YF2, YF3, etc.

Wait, A1 is a bright red substance. Oh! I remember that some fluorides have intense colors. For example, YF3 might not be red. Wait, perhaps A1 is something like BrF3, but no, because Y is another element. Wait, but Br isn't Y in this case.

Wait, another thought: when a fluoride decomposes into another fluoride and F2, perhaps the decomposition is a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Another point: A1 oxidizes xenon. That suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizer, but perhaps some fluorides are too. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a perfluoride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: Maybe A1 is YF5, which upon decomposition gives YF3 and F2.

So the reaction would be 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2↑.

Wait, let me compute the fluorine percentage in YF3.

Using the same formula, 57/(Y+57) = 0.3196 → Y=121.5 as before.

Hmm, but 121.5 is about the atomic weight of tellurium (Te is 127.6). Alternatively, perhaps it's another element. Let's see: what's the element around atomic weight 121?

Looking at the periodic table:

- Iodine is ~126.9.

- Xenon is ~131.

- Maybe it's not a main group element. Alternatively, could Y be a transition metal?

Wait, let me think of Y as iodine. Then YF3 would be IF3. But wait, iodine is a halogen, not a metal. So in that case, Y would be a non-metal. But in the context of fluorides, Y is more likely a metal.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a transition metal with a high atomic weight. Let me think. For example, tungsten is about 183.84, which is too high. Maybe Y isn't a metal, but perhaps another halogen?

Wait, but the problem says that A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So Y plus F2 gives A3. So if Y is a metal, then A3 would be YF, YF2, etc. But if Y is a non-metal, like sulfur, then SF6 is a known compound.

Wait, perhaps Y is sulfur. Let's see:

If Y is sulfur (S, atomic weight ~32.07), then A3 would be something like SF6, which is a known compound. But let's see if that fits.

Wait, let me think about the decomposition of A1. Suppose A1 is a higher fluoride, like YF5, which upon decomposition gives YF3 and F2.

So if Y is S, then YF5 would be SF5, which is a known compound? Not that I recall. Alternatively, maybe YF3 is the product. But if Y is S, then YF3 is SF3, which is less common. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Let me think about what the fluorination of Y would give A3. If Y is a metal, perhaps adding F2 would give YF, YF2, etc.

Wait, the problem says that when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. And in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. Hmm, what could A4 and A5 be?

Wait, if A4 is a solution, then perhaps it's a fluoride solution. Or maybe A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride.

Wait, when you add Y (metal) to a solution of a fluoride (A4), you get another compound (A5). Hmm, perhaps a displacement reaction? Or a precipitation.

Wait, another thought: if A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and Y is another metal, maybe adding Y would cause a redox reaction. Or perhaps a metathesis reaction, producing a precipitate.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the decomposition of A5 in water. When A5 is in water, it breaks down into two substances. Maybe A5 is a salt that hydrolyzes in water. For example, if A5 is a nitride, it would react with water to produce ammonia and another substance. Alternatively, if A5 is a sulfide, it might produce H2S and another product.

Wait, maybe A5 is a fluorosulfate or something similar. Hmm, not sure.

Let me go back to the fluorine percentages. So in A2, fluorine is 31.96% by mass. Let's try another approach. Let's calculate the molar mass of A2.

Suppose A2 is YF_b.

Fluorine's molar mass is 19 g/mol.

So, (b *19) / (Y + b*19) ) = 0.3196.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

b*19 = 0.3196(Y + 19b)

=> 19b = 0.3196 Y + 6.0724 b

Bring terms with b to one side:

19b -6.0724b = 0.3196 Y

12.9276 b = 0.3196 Y

=> Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * b

Which is Y ≈40.5 b.

So, since Y must be an integer (well, atomic weight, not necessarily integer), and b must be a positive integer.

Possible values for b and Y:

b=1: Y≈40.5 → not a real element.

b=2: Y≈81 → which is close to strontium (87.62), but not exact.

b=3: Y≈121.5 → which is near tellurium (127.6).

But let's see, if Y is 121.5, which is approximately the atomic weight of Te (tellurium). So perhaps Y is Te.

Wait, but Te is a non-metal, a metalloid. So if Y is Te, then A3 would be TeF_x. For example, TeF4 is a known compound, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let me check.

If Y is approximately 81, that's close to the atomic weight of strontium (Sr, 87.62). But 81 is actually bromine's atomic weight (79.90). Hmm, but bromine is a non-metal.

Wait, but if Y is 81, perhaps it's a metal like yttrium? No, Y is yttrium, atomic number 39, atomic weight about 88.91. Close to 81, but not exact.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition of A1 is a reaction where A1 (YF_a) breaks down into A2 (YF_b) and F2.

So, YF_a → YF_b + F2.

In such a reaction, fluorine is being released. So the formula would imply that each molecule of A1 produces one molecule of A2 and some F2.

Wait, perhaps the stoichiometry is:

2 YF_a → 2 YF_b + (a - b) F2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition into a lower fluoride and fluorine.

Wait, for example, YF4 → YF2 + F2.

So in this case, each mole of YF4 produces 1 mole of YF2 and 1 mole of F2.

So the stoichiometry would be 2 YF4 → 2 YF2 + 2 F2.

But I'm not sure if that's a common reaction.

Alternatively, maybe YF3 → YF + F2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's stick with the percentages. If A2 is YF_b with fluorine content 31.96%, then Y must be around 40.5 * b.

Assuming b=2, then Y≈81. No nearby element is exactly 81. Wait, bromine is about 79.9, which is close. Bromine is a halogen, so perhaps Y is Br.

Wait, but if Y is bromine, then A3 would be a bromide fluoride. But bromine is a non-metal, and the problem states that adding Y (metal?) in a 1:1 ratio to A4 gives A5. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of Y as a transition metal with a higher atomic weight.

Wait, if Y is around 120, which element is that? Iodine is about 126.9. Maybe it's not Y.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on this. Let me think about the other parts of the problem.

A3 can interact with xenon. Xenon is inert, so perhaps A3 is a strong oxidizer that can react with xenon under certain conditions.

Another point: A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So, perhaps Y is a metal that when reacted with fluorine forms a fluoride. For example, Y could be sodium (Na), forming NaF.

But sodium's atomic weight is about 23, so if A3 is NaF, then fluorine's percentage would be (19)/(23+19)=19/42≈45.2%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if Y is calcium (Ca, atomic weight 40), A3 would be CaF2. Fluorine percentage would be (2*19)/(40+38)=38/78≈48.7%, still higher.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps A3 is YF, which would have fluorine content of 19/(Y+19) = 31.96% →19/(Y+19)=0.3196 → Y+19=59.37 → Y≈40.37. Which is close to zirconium (Zr, ~91.22). But that's way higher.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that A1 is a higher fluoride, and A2 is a lower fluoride. So, perhaps A1 is YF5, A2 is YF3.

Then, fluorine percent in A2 is 57/(Y+57) = 0.3196 → Y= (57/(0.3196)) -57 → but wait, no: 57/(Y+57) = 0.3196 → Y+57 =57/0.3196 ≈ 178 → Y≈121.

Hmm, again 121, which is near tellurium.

But tellurium is a metalloid, and its fluoride TeF4 is a known compound. So perhaps Y is tellurium.

Wait, if Y is Te, then:

A2 is TeF3.

Fluorine percent: (3*19)/(127.6 + 57) = 57/(184.6) ≈31.0%.

Which is close to 31.96%. Hmm, that's pretty close. So perhaps Y is tellurium.

But wait, the problem says that A1 is bright red. TeF4 is a bright yellow crystalline solid. I'm not sure about TeF3's color. Maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another possibility: Y is iodine (I), atomic weight ~126.9.

If Y is I, then A2 could be IF3. Fluorine percent: (3*19)/(126.9 + 57)=57/183.9≈31.0%. Again close to the given 31.96%.

Hmm, but I is a non-metal, and when you add iodine in a 1:1 ratio to a solution of A4, what happens? Not sure.

Wait, but let's proceed. If Y is iodine, then A3 would be IFn, which is a known compound. But I'm not certain.

Wait, earlier I thought Y is Te, but let's see. If Y is Te, then the fluorine percentage in A2 (TeF3) is about 31.0%, which is a bit lower than 31.96, but close enough considering possible approximations.

So maybe Y is Te.

Now, let's think about the other parts. A3 can interact with xenon. So TeF3 might react with Xe under certain conditions, perhaps as a fluorinating agent.

Then, when Y (Te) is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, A5 is formed. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

Wait, what reaction could involve Te and a fluoride solution?

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a fluoride salt of another metal. For example, if A4 is NaF, and adding Te would cause a reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what is the molecular weight of A4? The question asks about the range for A4's molecular weight. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 160-180, D)110-130.

So perhaps I can find the formula of A4 and compute its molecular weight.

Wait, A4 is a binary compound of Y and F. So, A4 is YF_x.

If Y is Te (atomic weight ~127.6), then:

If A4 is TeF4, its molecular weight would be 127.6 + 4*19 = 127.6 +76=203.6, which falls into option B (220-240). But that's higher than B's lower end.

Wait, but option B is 220-240. So 203.6 is below that.

Alternatively, if A4 is TeF2, then molecular weight is 127.6 + 38 =165.6, which is in option C (160-180).

Hmm, but earlier calculation suggested A2 is TeF3, which would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recap.

We have five binary compounds. So Y can form five different fluorides. If Y is Te, it can form TeF2, TeF3, TeF4, TeF5, TeF6. So that's five compounds. That fits.

So A1 is one of these, perhaps the most stable or the higher fluoride.

In the decomposition, A1 → A2 + F2. So, for example, TeF5 → TeF3 + F2.

So A1 would be TeF5, which upon decomposition gives TeF3 (A2) and F2.

In that case, the fluorine percentage in A2 (TeF3) is 57/(127.6+57) =57/184.6 ≈31.0%, which is close to the given 31.96%. So that makes sense.

So Y is Te.

Now, moving on. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So Y is Te, so A3 is a fluoride of Te. Perhaps TeF4, which is a known compound.

Then, when Y (Te) is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 (another fluoride), A5 is formed. So perhaps A4 is a metal fluoride, and adding Te causes a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different compound.

Wait, but the problem says that adding Y (Te) in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4 produces A5. So maybe A4 is a salt that reacts with Te to form a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF_x, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So A5 is likely a salt that undergoes hydrolysis. For example, if A5 is a fluoride salt that reacts with water to produce HF and another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a nitride or sulfide that reacts with water.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about A4 and A5 in terms of their composition.

If A4 is a fluoride of another metal, say, NaF. Then adding Te (element Y) in 1:1 molar ratio would not react because NaF is stable. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more reactive fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a compound that reacts with Te to form another fluoride.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride of Te, like TeF5. Adding Te metal might cause a reduction.

Wait, if A4 is TeF5, adding Te metal (Y) would produce TeF4 and perhaps F2 gas. But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is: Te + TeF5 → 2 TeF3.

But I'm not sure what A5 would be in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different metal's fluoride, and adding Te causes a displacement reaction.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of MgF2. Adding Te metal (which is a good reducing agent) might reduce MgF2 to Mg and produce TeF4. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple precipitation, but without more info, it's hard to say.

But perhaps I don't need to know the exact identity of A4 and A5 to find their molecular weights. Because the problem is only asking about the molecular weight range of A4.

Assuming A4 is a binary compound of Y (Te) and F. So, A4 could be TeF_x.

Earlier, I thought A2 is TeF3, which would have a molecular weight of 127.6 +57=184.6 g/mol. But that's above option C (160-180). Wait, 184.6 is just above 180, so it's outside option C.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is TeF2. Its molecular weight would be 127.6 +38=165.6, which falls into option C (160-180).

Wait, but earlier when considering A1 as TeF5, which decomposes into TeF3 (A2) and F2, then A4 could be TeF4. Its molecular weight is 127.6 + 76=203.6, which is in option B (220-240). But 203.6 is below that range, so it doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is another compound. Let me think.

Wait, considering that A3 is TeF4 (if Y is Te), and A1 is TeF5. So the five compounds are TeF2, TeF3, TeF4, TeF5, TeF6.

So A4 must be another one of these.

Wait, A4 is a binary compound, so it's YF_x. Let's say A4 is TeF4. Molecular weight is 127.6 +4*19=127.6+76=203.6. That's around 204, which is just below option B's 220-240.

Hmm, no. So perhaps A4 is TeF6. Molecular weight is 127.6 +6*19=127.6+114=241.6. That's within option B's range of 220-240. But 241.6 is just over 240.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is TeF2, with molecular weight 165.6, which falls into option C (160-180).

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Another approach: the problem states that when Y is added in 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, A5 decomposes in water.

If A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, perhaps like BaF2, and Y (Te) is added, perhaps a double displacement occurs, producing TeF2 and a precipitate. But without more info, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt that reacts with Te to form a different fluoride and another product. But I'm not certain.

But perhaps I should focus on what the question is asking: the molecular weight range of A4.

From earlier, if Y is Te, and A4 is TeF4, its molecular weight is 203.6, which is not in any of the given options except possibly B (220-240). But 203.6 is below 220.

Alternatively, if A4 is TeF6, molecular weight 241.6, which is just above option B's upper limit of 240. So that's also not fitting.

Wait, perhaps A4 is not a fluoride but another compound. Another possibility: A4 could be a salt containing YF_x and another ion. But since A4 is a binary compound, it's YF_x.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach.

If Y is Te, then the possible fluorides are TeF2, TeF3, TeF4, TeF5, TeF6. Their molecular weights are:

TeF2: 127.6 + 38=165.6 → option C (160-180).

TeF3: 127.6 +57=184.6 → just above option C.

TeF4: 203.6 → option B is 220-240, so not in.

TeF5: 127.6 + 95=222.6 → this falls into option B (220-240).

TeF6: 127.6 + 114=241.6 → just above option B.

So if A4 is TeF5, molecular weight 222.6, which is in option B's range.

Alternatively, if A4 is TeF4, then 203.6 is just below option B. But perhaps the problem expects the next higher fluoride.

Wait, but from the decomposition reaction, A1 is decomposing into A2 and F2. Earlier, I thought A1 is TeF5 and A2 is TeF3. So A4 could be another compound.

Wait, perhaps A4 is TeF4. Then its molecular weight is 203.6, which is not in any option except B's lower end. But the options don't include 200-220, only B is 220-240.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Could Y be a different element?

Wait, earlier calculation with Y=40.5*b. Suppose b=2 gives Y=81. What element is around 81?

Looking at the periodic table, Yttrium (Y) is atomic number 39, atomic weight ~88.91. Close to 81.

If Y is Yttrium (Y), then let's recalculate.

If Y is Yttrium (Y), atomic weight ~89.

In A2, fluorine percent is (b*19)/(89 +19b) =0.3196.

So, 19b =0.3196*(89 +19b)

19b = 0.3196*89 + 0.3196*19b

19b -0.3196*19b =0.3196*89

19b*(1 -0.3196) =0.3196*89

19b*0.6804 =28.4224

So, 19b=28.4224 /0.6804 ≈41.78 → b≈41.78/19≈2.199.

Hmm, so b is approximately 2.2. But b must be an integer. So perhaps b=2.

Then, checking fluorine percentage in YF2.

So (2*19)/(89 +38)=38/127≈29.92%. Close to 31.96%, but not exact. So perhaps Y is not Yttrium.

Alternatively, perhaps b=3.

So, (3*19)/(89 +57)=57/146≈39.04%. Which is higher than 31.96%.

Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps Y is not Yttrium. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that Y is Te is correct, and the fluorine percentage in A2 is approximate. So A4 could be TeF5 with molecular weight 222.6, which is in option B (220-240). So the answer would be option B.

But let me check the options again:

Options:
A) 140-160
B) 220-240
C) 160-180
D) 110-130

So, if A4 is TeF5 (222.6), it's in B.

Alternatively, if A4 is TeF6 (241.6), it's just over B's upper limit.

Hmm, but the problem says "range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls." So if any of the possibilities fit, that's the answer.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is a different compound, not a fluoride. For example, maybe it's a salt containing YF_x as part of a larger structure. But the question says it's a binary compound, so it's YF_x.

So, considering all possibilities, if Y is Te, and A4 is TeF5, then the molecular weight is 222.6, which fits into option B (220-240).

So, the answer would be option B.


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, based on the given reactions and properties. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information and Assumptions**:
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F2). This suggests A1 is a higher fluoride, and A2 is a lower fluoride.
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y and can interact with xenon, suggesting A3 is a fluoride of Y.
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Element Y**:
   - The fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%. Assuming A2 is YF₃, the molecular formula gives:
     \[
     \frac{3 \times 19}{Y + 3 \times 19} = 0.3196 \implies Y \approx 121.5
     \]
   - This is close to the atomic weight of tellurium (Te, ~127.6). Thus, Y is likely tellurium.

3. **Possible Fluorides of Y (Te)**:
   - Tellurium forms five binary fluorides: TeF₂, TeF₃, TeF₄, TeF₅, and TeF₆. These match the five binary compounds mentioned in the problem.

4. **Determining A4**:
   - A4 is a binary compound of Te and fluorine. Its molecular weight depends on the specific fluoride it represents:
     - TeF₂: \( 127.6 + 2 \times 19 = 165.6 \, \text{g/mol} \)
     - TeF₃: \( 127.6 + 3 \times 19 = 184.6 \, \text{g/mol} \)
     - TeF₄: \( 127.6 + 4 \times 19 = 203.6 \, \text{g/mol} \)
     - TeF₅: \( 127.6 + 5 \times 19 = 222.6 \, \text{g/mol} \)
     - TeF₆: \( 127.6 + 6 \times 19 = 241.6 \, \text{g/mol} \)

5. **Matching A4 to the Options**:
   - The molecular weight of A4 must fall into one of the given ranges:
     - A) 140–160: TeF₂ (165.6) does not fit.
     - B) 220–240: TeF₅ (222.6) fits.
     - C) 160–180: TeF₂ (165.6) or TeF₃ (184.6) partially fits, but TeF₃ is just above the range.
     - D) 110–130: No fluoride of Te fits.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the calculations, A4 is most likely TeF₅, with a molecular weight of 222.6 g/mol, which falls into the range 220–240.
