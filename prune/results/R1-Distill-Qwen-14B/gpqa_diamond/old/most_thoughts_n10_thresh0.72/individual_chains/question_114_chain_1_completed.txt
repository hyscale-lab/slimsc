Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I've got two reactions here, and I need to figure out the reagents A and B from the options given. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanone is a ketone, right? And when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, that usually involves nucleophilic addition. Oh right, the cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile here. So in the presence of an acid, maybe?

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and an acid catalyst. Oh, because when you have a ketone reacting with HCN or its equivalent, it's typically under acidic conditions. The mechanism would be the acid protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, forming a cyanohydrin.

So the product is a cyanohydrin. The structure would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group added to the same carbon as the ketone. So in this case, butan-2-one becomes 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that makes sense. So for the reaction, the reagent A would be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, the acids given are H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid, I think) or maybe something else. So A could be H3O+.

Now the second reaction is a bit trickier. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B and water to form the corresponding butanoic acid. Hmm, so the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. There are two main ways: acidic hydrolysis and basic hydrolysis. In acidic conditions, you might get a carboxylic acid, and in basic, a carboxylate which then acidifies to the acid.

So for nitrile to carboxylic acid, you typically use strong acid and heat. Wait, but in the presence of water. Let's think: the reaction is probably hydrolysis of the nitrile group. So if reagent B is H2O and an acid, like HCl, maybe?

Looking at the options, for B, options are HCl or CH3COOH. So if B is HCl, then the conditions are acidic. So the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid when treated with HCl and water, perhaps under reflux.

Wait, but the second reaction's reagent is just B (H2O?), but the product is the acid. So the initial reagent would be aqueous conditions with an acid catalyst. So B is HCl.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+ (acid), B = HCl. That fits with what I thought. Because first reaction uses acid, second uses HCl as the catalyst.

Option D says A is NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. That’s usually used in the hydroboration reaction or in some other reactions involving carbonyl groups. But wait, in the first reaction, we're making a cyanohydrin. So does that require an acid or something else?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so option A or B). Then in the second reaction, B is HCl (so option A or C).

But looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl. That matches. So that would be the correct choice.

Wait, but what about other options? Let me check. Option C says A is NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, that would mean using a bisulfite. But I don't think bisulfite is used in cyanohydrin formation. It might be used in something like the reduction of the carbonyl group, but not for adding CN-.

So the first reaction requires acid (H3O+), so B and A are H3O+ and HCl respectively. So option A is correct.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) adds to the carbonyl carbon. For such a reaction, an acid catalyst is typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, such as H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid in the presence of reagent B and water. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically occurs under acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. Thus, reagent B is likely HCl.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is not strong enough for efficient nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not used in cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both A and B are incorrect for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
