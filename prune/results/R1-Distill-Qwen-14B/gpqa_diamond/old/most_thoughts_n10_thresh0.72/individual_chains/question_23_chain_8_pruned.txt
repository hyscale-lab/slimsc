Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, the researcher checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot decreased, and two new spots appeared. I need to find out which of the options (A to D) could be the products.

Hmm, I remember that when an alkene is treated with HBr, it typically undergoes an addition reaction, usually via a bromonium ion intermediate. The mechanism is probably similar to what's discussed in the alkenes chapter. So, the starting material has a benzene ring with an ether group attached, and that ether has a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group.

Wait, let me draw the structure in my mind. The benzene ring has an -O- group connected to a butenyl chain. The butenyl part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the structure is like OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no, wait. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no. Wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond at position 3. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, wait. Wait, butenyl has four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? Wait, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would imply the double bond starts at C3. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be, because but-3-en-1-yl would have
