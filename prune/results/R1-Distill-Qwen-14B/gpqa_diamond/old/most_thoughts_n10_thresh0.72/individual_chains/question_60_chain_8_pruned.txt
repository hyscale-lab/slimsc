Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to it, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spaceship that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 Earth years. They're sending an astronaut who is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it'll take from the astronaut's perspective to reach Earth. The options are given, and one of them suggests the astronaut dies before getting there.

Wait, the problem is about time dilation, right? Because when you travel at such high speeds, time slows down for the traveler compared to someone on Earth. So from the astronaut's perspective, the trip time is shorter than what someone else would measure.

But wait, the question is asking about the time from the astronaut's point of view. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I think I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, I'm not sure of the exact distance, but I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Hmm, but wait, the problem might not provide exact distance, maybe it's a trick question that ignores the actual distance and just focuses on time dilation.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says 'from the point of view of the astronaut.' So the astronaut's own experienced time is what we're after.

But how do we calculate that? Time dilation is part of special relativity, so the formula for time experienced (proper time) is given by the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since the astronaut is moving at a high speed, the time experienced will be less than the time measured in a stationary frame.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, time experienced is calculated using the proper time equation. The proper time (tau) is equal to the dilated time (t) multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), or tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, tau = t * sqrt(1 - beta squared), where beta is v/c.

But wait, who measures the dilated time? The
