Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have an operator P which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a matrix, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So, the system is in the eigenstate of Px corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz.

Hmm, right. The uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I'll need to find the expectation value of Pz and the expectation value of Pz squared, then compute the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. Since the state is an eigenstate of Px, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Pz. So when I measure Pz, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Pz, which are given by the diagonal elements of the Pz matrix. Looking at Pz's matrix, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

But the state is given, so I can compute the expectation value of Pz by taking the inner product of the state with Pz multiplied by the state.

Let me write down the state vector. The state is |ψ> = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ]. So each component is in the basis which are the eigenvectors of Pz. That means that Pz is diagonal in this basis, right?

Wait, looking at Pz's matrix, it's diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So when I apply Pz to |ψ>, I get a vector where each component is multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So to find ⟨Pz⟩, I can compute ψ† Pz ψ. Since Pz is diagonal, this will be:

⟨Pz⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 )* ħ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) *0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ).

Wait, let me compute that.

First term: ( (-1/2) )^2 * ħ = (1/4) ħ.
Second term: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.
Third term: ( (-1/2) )^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ)= - ħ/4.

So adding them up: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Hmm, okay. Now I need ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal and real (because it's an observable), Pz squared is just the square of the diagonal elements. So Pz^2 has diagonal entries (ħ^2,
