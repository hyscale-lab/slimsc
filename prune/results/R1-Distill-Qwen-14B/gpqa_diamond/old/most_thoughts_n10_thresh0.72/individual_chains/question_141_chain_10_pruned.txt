Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about what happens when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me try to think through this.

First, I remember that when aromatic halides react with strong bases like NaNH2, it's usually a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Wait, but wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, wait, wait. I think 1-bromobenzene-2-d is actually 2-bromo toluene, right? Because the substituents are on the 1 and 2 positions. Wait, no, no, wait. No, I might be getting confused. Let me clarify: the numbering might be that the bromine is on position 1 and the deuterium (d) is on position 2. Or perhaps the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the "2-d" part is a typo or shorthand. Like, maybe it's 2-deutero. So the structure is benzene with a Br on carbon 1 and a deuterium (D) on carbon 2. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

Now, when you have such a molecule reacting with NaNH2 in ammonia, that's a typical condition for elimination. Wait, but wait, aromatic elimination? Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution? No, wait, aromatic rings are generally not very reactive in
