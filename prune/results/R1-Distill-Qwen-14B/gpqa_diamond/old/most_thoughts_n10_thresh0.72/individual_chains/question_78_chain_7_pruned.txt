Okay, so I've got this question about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials.

The question is asking for the expressions of the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a given time t and position r. The setup is that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the field at point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r.

Wait, so the fields are retarded, meaning they depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time tr. Oh right, because the effects can't travel faster than the speed of light, so the fields at time t are based on where the charge was at t_r, where t_r = t - (r - s(tr)) / c, or something like that. But I'm not sure about the exact expression for d.

So, the scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law, but with a time delay. The vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge, I think. The standard expressions for potentials due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q / (4πε₀)) * [1 / (r' - (v t_r)/c²)] ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing something up here.

Wait, the general expressions for the potentials when charges are moving are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'|) d³r'

A(r, t) = (1/(4πμ₀ c²)) ∫ (j(r', t_r) / |r - r'|) d³r'

But in the case of a single moving point charge, the charge density ρ is a delta function: ρ = q δ³(r' - s(tr)). Similarly, the current density j would be q δ³(r' - s(tr)) * v / c², since current is charge per unit time, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, perhaps more precisely, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1 / |d| ] where d is (r - (v/c²) (t - tr)) or something like that. Hmm, maybe I should think about the Lienard potentials.

Right, the Lienard expressions for the potentials of a moving charge. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) [1 / (r - (v/c²)(t - t_r)))] evaluated at the correct time, but I'm not sure about the exact form.

Wait, no, the scalar potential is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1 / |d|], where d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr), but wait, in the given options, d is the vector from the field generating point (s(tr)) to r, which is the same as d = r - s(tr).

So, V should be q/(4πε₀ |d|).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says V is q/(4πε₀ r), but that's only the case when d = r, which would be when the charge is at the origin. But in our case, the charge is at s(tr), so d is r - s(tr). So none of the options directly have |d| in the denominator except C and D.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: V = (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v) ]

Hmm, that's interesting. Because d is r - s(tr), and in terms of the denominator, perhaps it's (d c - (d·v)).

Wait, maybe the denominator is |d| multiplied by (1 - (v/c) (d·v)/(d c) ) or something? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are given by the Lienard formulas. The scalar potential is V = [ q ] / [4π ε₀ ( (d) c - (v · d) ) / c ].

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the expression more carefully.

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4π ε₀)) / |d - (v/c²) (t - t_r)|. Wait, but t_r is the retarded time, which is t - |d|/c. So t - t_r is |d| / c.

So substituting, the denominator becomes |d - (v (t - t_r) ) / c² | = |d - v (|d|/c²) )|.

Hmm, but this seems complicated because d is a vector. So it's the vector d minus (v * |d|) / c².

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out |d| from the denominator. Let me see:

Denominator = |d (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c² ) |, where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Wait, but that may not be correct. Let me think again.

The denominator would be |d - (v t) / c² |, where t is the time since the charge was at s(tr). Wait, but t is the time variable, so perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the expression for the potentials in terms of the velocity.

Wait, the standard expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4π ε₀)) [ 1 / |r - s(tr)| ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) [ v(tr) / |r - s(tr)| ]

But wait, this can't be right because then the denominator is |d|, which is the same for both. But in that case, option C would have V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)), which doesn't look like that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the exact expressions.

The scalar potential for a point charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4π ε₀)) ∫ [ρ(r', t) / |r - r'| ] d³r'

Since ρ is zero except at r'
