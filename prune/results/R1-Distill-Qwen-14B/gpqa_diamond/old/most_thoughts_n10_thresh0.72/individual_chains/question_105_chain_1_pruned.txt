Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. Hmm, the question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun, right? And one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K, I guess.

The problem says that when we observe this star, the brightness variations caused by the spots rotating into and out of view mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking: to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots would, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet compared to the star's radius?

Wait, so normally, when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of the dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So the formula for the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a variation. The star's brightness isn't uniform. So when parts of the star with spots rotate into view, the total brightness changes. The spots are darker, so when they are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer. The star is rotating, so the spots come and go, causing a periodic dimming and brightening.

Wait, but
