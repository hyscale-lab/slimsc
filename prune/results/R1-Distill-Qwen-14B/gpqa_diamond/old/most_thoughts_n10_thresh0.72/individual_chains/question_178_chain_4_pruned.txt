Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm supposed to figure out the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, σ matrices are antisymmetric and come from the commutator of gamma matrices, which are part of the Dirac algebra.

First, I need to compute the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of a coupling constant can be found by ensuring that the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Because the action S = ∫ L d^4x must be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4. Let's break down each part of L_int and find the dimensions of each factor.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let's go step by step.

First, the Dirac fields ψ and ψ̄ have mass dimension 3/2 each. Because in four dimensions, a spinor field ψ has [ψ]_M = 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ^† γ^0) also has the same dimension, 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Each γ has dimension 1, since they are matrices but don't carry mass dimension themselves. Wait, no—actually, the gamma matrices are dimensionless because they are just matrices in the Clifford algebra. So σ_{μν} is a combination of commutators of gamma matrices. So [σ_{μν}]_M = 0, because it's a product of dimensionless matrices.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, maybe? Or another gauge field? Wait, F^{μν} is antisymmetric and has dimension 2. Because for the Maxwell field tensor, F_{μν} is the derivative of the gauge field A, so F has dimension [∂ A], which is [mass]^1 * [A]. But the gauge field A has dimension 1 in four dimensions. So F^{μν} has dimension [mass]^1 * [A] → 1 (from ∂) times 1 (from A) → 2.

Wait, let me think again. The field strength F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each A is a gauge field, which has mass dimension 1. So each derivative adds one, so each term is [∂][A] → 1 * 1 = 1? Wait, no. Each A is dimension 1, so ∂ A would have dimension 1 (from ∂) + 1 (from A) = 2. So F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term L_int is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

So the product is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Let's compute the mass dimension of each part:

[ψ̄] = 3/2
[σ_{μν}] = 0
[ψ] = 3/2
[F^{μν}] = 2

So the product of these is:

3/2 * 0 * 3/2 * 2. Wait, no, the product is (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. But wait, I think I'm adding the dimensions incorrectly. Because it's each field's dimension multiplied together, but since they are each factors multiplied, their dimensions add.

Wait, no, dimensions add when you multiply fields. So for each field, you take its dimension and sum them.

So [ψ̄] = 3/2, [σ] =0, [ψ] =3/2, [F]=2. So sum is 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. Oh wait, but σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so the dimensionless aspect doesn't change the sum.

So the product of the fields (ψ̄ σ ψ F)
