Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many exhibit optical activity. Optical activity means the compound has the ability to rotate plane-polarized light, which occurs when a molecule has chiralityâ€”meaning it has a stereocenter or some other form of asymmetry.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Wait, so the structure is Cl attached to carbon 1, which is double-bonded to carbon 2. Carbon 2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Wait, the formula is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1: Cl, CH2, and double bond. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

   Alternatively, the structure is Cl-C double bond to C(CH2CH3 or something? Wait, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and two other substituents. Let me think about its configuration.

   The double bond is between C1 and C2. So substituents on each end: C1 has Cl and a CH2CH3 (since but-1-ene is four carbons, so 1 is Cl, 2 is CH(CH3), perhaps? Wait, no. Wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding a methyl at C2 would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 has Cl, and then a CH2 group.
