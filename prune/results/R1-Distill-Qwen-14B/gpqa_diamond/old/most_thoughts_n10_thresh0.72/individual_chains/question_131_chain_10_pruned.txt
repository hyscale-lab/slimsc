Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The major product's NOESY NMR has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. I need to find which two resonances are connected.

First, I'll try to visualize the structures involved. The dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkeneâ€”so maybe something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Oh wait, no, the double bond would be between the two central carbons since it's a cis-alkene. So the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, that's butanedioic acid. But wait, it has a cis-alkene, so maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, wait, that's a trans arrangement. Wait, no. Wait, no, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a single bond. Wait, no, the problem says it's a cis-alkene, so the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH=CH2-COOH? No, wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but that's probably not right. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, when a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, which
