Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method. But wait, TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? I think that's a method used to detect planets by observing changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But maybe that's not directly relevant here since the question is about their orbital periods.

The question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T_eq(Planet1)/T_eq(Planet2) = 1.4. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So, T_eq(Planet2)/T_eq(Planet3) = 2.3. 

Oh wait, equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from the star. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), and assuming the star's temperature and radius are the same for all planets, the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of 1/(semi-major axis a). So, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). Or wait, it's sqrt(R_star/(2a)), so a is in the denominator under a square root, making T_eq inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

Wait, correct formula: The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the equation T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is the albedo. Since A is the same for all three planets, and assuming the host star's T_star and R_star are the same for all, the ratio of T_eq for each planet depends on their semi-major axes. So, T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

But wait, the problem says the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4. From the formula, T1 is proportional to 1
