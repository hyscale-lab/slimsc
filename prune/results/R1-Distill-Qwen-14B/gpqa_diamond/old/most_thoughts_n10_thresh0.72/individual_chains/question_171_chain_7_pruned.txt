Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. So, the question is about brominating six different benzene derivatives and figuring out the order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer yields. Hmm, I need to arrange substances 1 to 6 based on their para product's yield, from lowest to highest.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring play a big role. Electron-donating groups activate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to certain positionsâ€”ortho and para for activating groups. Electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring and typically direct to meta positions.

Wait, let me think. The substituents in each case:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So substitution would occur mainly at ortho and para positions. 

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Oh wait, that's phenyl acetate. The substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-OEt. Esters are electron-withdrawing by the inductive effect but the lone pairs from oxygen can donate some electrons through resonance. Wait, no, the ester group is actually a meta director because the oxygen is part of the carbonyl which is electron-withdrawing. Oh wait, the ester group has an oxygen attached to the benzene which is part of a carbonyl. So the ester group is a meta director. Because in the ester, the oxygen is in an electron-deficient area, so it deactivates the ring and directs meta.

Wait, no, wait. I get confused sometimes. Let's clarify: The substituent is an ester (like OAc, acetate group). The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it should deactivate the ring and direct incoming substituents to the meta positions. So para would be less favored. So the para product would be lower in yield for this one.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is attached to benzene. Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's an electron-withdrawing group (because of the electronegative Cl), but it's also ortho/para directing because of resonance. Wait, because Cl has lone
