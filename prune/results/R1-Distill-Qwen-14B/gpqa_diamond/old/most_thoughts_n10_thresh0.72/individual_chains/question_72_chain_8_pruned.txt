Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, that sounds like a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, so the starting compound is the diene version. Oh wait, hepta-2,5-diene, so it has two double bonds at positions 2 and 5. And there's a tert-butoxy group at position 7, which is probably the bridgehead.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, maybe in an SN2 reaction? But wait, the presence of two equivalents makes me think of a di-substitution. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups at carbons 5 and 6. So each of those positions has a Br2CH2- group.

Wait, in the reaction with sodium iodide, maybe the Br is replaced by iodide? Or perhaps it's a coupling reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a diene; the other compound is a dienophile? Let me think. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, but with two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So maybe the norbornene is acting as a diene and the other as a dienophile?

Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds. The other compound has a conjugated diene as well. Oh, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-addition or some cycloaddition
