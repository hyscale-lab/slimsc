Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see... The question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. Now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. So the basic idea is that the probability of decay isn't dependent on how much time has already passed; it's a memoryless process. That means even if the atom hasn't decayed for a certain amount of time, the probability of it decaying in the next interval remains the same as it was initially.

Wait, but wait. The given information says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the decay probability P is 32% for 100 minutes. I think the formula for the decay probability is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time.

So first, I need to find the decay constant λ. Let me rearrange the formula. We have P = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ is -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, ln(0.68) is negative, so dividing by 100 makes λ positive. Let me calculate that. Ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait, 0.68 is a bit less than 2/3 (which is about 0.6667). Let me get a more accurate value. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.

So λ would be 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. But wait, the next 150 minutes from when? From the start? Or from the current time?

Wait, looking back at the question: "We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." So that's t_total = 100 minutes. Then they say 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed. So we're at t=50. We need to find the probability it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200 minutes.

But in radioactive decay, the probability of decay between t and t+Δt is given by P = 1 - e^(-λΔt), regardless of when t is. Because it's memoryless. Wait, no. Wait, the probability that it hasn't decayed by time
