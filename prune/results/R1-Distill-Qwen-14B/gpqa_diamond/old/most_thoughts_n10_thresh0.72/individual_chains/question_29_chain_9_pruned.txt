Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the responsible gene. 

So, the gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a chemical mutagen that typically causes point mutations, usually by adding methyl groups, leading to base changes—mostly transitions (like C to T or G to A), I think.

The question shows the intact gene sequence and four mutants. I need to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I guess this would happen if the mutation disrupts the gene's function, perhaps by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences, I should compare each mutant to the intact gene. Let's write down the changes.

The intact gene starts:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact, the first part after ATG is TTT vs TCT. Wait, let me look closer. Wait, the original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

So in the first exon, the original sequence is ATG TTT CTC GCT... and mutant 1 is ATG TCT ACG GCT... So the first change is at the third nucleotide. Wait, the first triplet is ATG, which is the start codon. The next triplet in the original is TTT (Phe), and in mutant 1, it's TCT (Ser). So that's a substitution. Then the next part: CTC in the original becomes ACG in mutant 1. Wait, CTC is Leu, and ACG is also Thr? Or is it a different codon. Let me think: CTC is Leu (Leucine), and ACG is also Leucine? Wait, no, ACG is Thr (Threonine). Oh wait, no, let me check: The genetic code. CTT is Leu, CTC is Leu. ACG is indeed Thr. So that's a substitution from Leu to Thr.

But I don't know if that's a missense mutation or if it creates a stop codon. Looking further down, I don't see a stop codon in mutant 1. So maybe it's a silent mutation, but not necessarily. Or perhaps it's still a frame shift? Wait no, the changes seem to be substitutions, not indels, since all sequences are same length.

Wait, let me check if any of the mutations cause a frameshift.
