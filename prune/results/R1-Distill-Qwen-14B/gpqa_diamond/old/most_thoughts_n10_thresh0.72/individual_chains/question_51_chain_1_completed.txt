Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. Oh right, it's about a charge placed near a grounded conducting sphere. I've studied a bit about conductors and electric fields, but I'm not entirely confident, so I'll have to think carefully.

Alright, the setup is: there's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Wait, potential energy. I remember that the potential energy between two charges is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r, but that's for point charges. But here, one of them is a conducting sphere. Oh right, conducting spheres have some specific properties. Since the sphere is grounded, that probably means it's connected to the earth, so it can have charges flow in or out. Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, when another charge is placed near it, charges will redistribute on the sphere. But wait, the sphere is conducting, so charges will reside on the outer surface.

Wait, but because the sphere is grounded, any excess charge on it can flow to the ground. So if we place a charge q near the sphere, the sphere will induce charges on its surface. But since it's grounded, the induced charges might not just be the image charge I'm used to thinking about.

Wait, no, wait. For a conducting sphere, when you bring a charge near it, the free charges on the sphere redistribute themselves. For a grounded sphere, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero because it's connected to the ground. Because the ground is at zero potential, the sphere's potential must also be zero. So the sphere must have some charge that ensures its potential is zero.

So, when a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere (radius R), the sphere will have an induced charge. Let's think about image charges. For a conducting sphere, the method of images can be used. When a charge q is outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the sphere can be considered as having an image charge inside such that the potential on the sphere is zero.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. The image charge method says that for a sphere, the image charge's magnitude is q', and it's located at a distance of r' from the center, where r' is such that r' * d = R², I think. So the image point is along the line connecting the charge and the center, but inside the sphere.

Wait, no, the formula for the image charge when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere is that the image charge q' is (R²/d), but wait, not quite. Let me think again. The image charge for a sphere of radius R is given by q' = - (R²/d) * q, but wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, maybe I should recall that the image charge is located at a distance of R²/d from the center, on the same line as the original charge and the center.

Wait, okay, let's clarify. The image charge q' for a charge q outside a conducting sphere of radius R is such that the potential at the surface due to both q and q' is zero. So the image charge is located at a point along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge q. So the distance from the center to where the image charge is placed is r' = R²/d. Because if d is the distance from the charge to the center, then the image is placed at r' such that r' = R²/d. So when d is large, r' approaches zero, which makes sense because the sphere's image charge would be negligible.

Wait no, maybe I have it reversed. Let me think about the formula. The distance from the center to the image charge is (R²)/d. So, for example, if d is much larger than R, then the image charge is very close to the center.

But wait, the exact value of the image charge's magnitude is q' = (R²/d) * q. Or wait, perhaps it's q' = (R^2/d) * q, but with a negative sign because the image charge is opposite to the inducing charge. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think through the calculation.

The potential at the surface due to q and q' must cancel out. The potential due to q is V = kq/(R) if the surface is at R. The potential due to the image charge would be kq'/(R - r'), where r' is the distance between the image charge and the point on the surface along the line. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the condition that the potential on the surface is zero because the sphere is a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium and it's grounded.

Alternatively, the potential at any point on the conductor's surface is the same, and for a grounded conductor, that potential is zero. So the sum of potentials due to the charge q and the image charge must be zero on the sphere's surface.

Wait, perhaps I should model the sphere as having a charge Q, but since it's grounded, any induced charges must adjust so that the sphere's potential is zero. Alternatively, the image method tells us that the charge q induces an image charge q' inside the sphere such that the potential due to q and q' is zero on the surface.

So, the potential at the surface (radius R) due to q is V1 = k q / (d'), where d' is the distance from q to any point on the sphere. Wait, but no, the distance from q to the center is d, and the sphere's radius is R, so the distance from q to a point on the sphere along the line is (d + (distance from center to point)) or (d - (distance from center to point)), depending on direction. Hmm, no, wait. The charge q is outside the sphere, so the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface is (d - R) if the point is along the line towards q, and (d + R) if it's on the opposite side. Wait, but in the image method, the image charge is placed inside the sphere such that the potential due to q and the image charge is zero on the surface.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me consider the potential on the surface. The potential from charge q is kq/(d) because the distance from q to the center is d, but the potential on the sphere's surface due to q would vary depending on where you are on the sphere. Wait, no, actually, the potential on the surface due to q can be found as kq/(d) plus the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away, considering the potential due to the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. Wait, so the potential at the point where q is placed would be the potential due to the sphere (which is zero because it's grounded) plus the potential due to any induced charges.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. The potential at the point where q is placed is due to the sphere's induced charges and any other charges present. But since the sphere is neutral (or grounded and thus can have charges flow in/out), perhaps the induced charges are such that the potential at the point d is the same as the potential on the sphere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should recall that the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere, which is in the presence of the sphere's induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, which means its potential is kept at zero. So the potential at the point d is due to the charge q and any induced charges on the sphere. But if the sphere is at zero potential, then the potential at d would be due to the induced charges only.

Alternatively, the potential at a point outside a sphere is the same as the potential due to a point charge located at the center, with a magnitude equal to the total charge on the sphere. But in this case, the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. Therefore, the potential at the point where q is placed is only due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded and hence the induced charges would adjust to make the potential on the sphere zero. So the charge on the sphere is such that when combined with the charge q, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

Hmm, perhaps another way: the potential at the sphere's surface is the sum of the potential due to q and any induced charge on the sphere. Since the sphere's potential is zero, the sum V_sphere = V_q + V_induced = 0.

But the induced charge on the sphere would be such that the potential it creates at the sphere's surface cancels the potential from q. So V_induced = - V_q.

Wait, but what is V_q at the sphere's surface? The charge q is at a distance d from the center, so the potential due to q at the sphere's surface (which is at a distance R from the center) varies depending on the point. Wait, no, the potential due to a point charge is a scalar, so the potential at any point on the sphere's surface would be the same as the potential at a distance (d - R) from q if the point is on the same side as q, but that's not correct because the potential due to a point charge is a scalar quantity. So the potential at any point on the sphere's surface due to q is given by V_q = k q / (distance from q to that point on the sphere).

Wait, but the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface along the line connecting the center and q is (d - R), and for the opposite side, it's (d + R). But the potential on the sphere's surface due to q would vary depending on where you are. That complicates things because the sphere's potential is supposed to be uniform.

Ah, maybe that's where the image charge comes into play. The image charge is inside the sphere such that the potential from the image charge cancels the potential from q on the sphere's surface. So that the potential due to q and the image charge q' is zero on the sphere's surface.

So, the image charge q' is located at a distance r' from the center, such that r' = (R^2)/d. Because when you have a charge q outside a sphere of radius R, the image charge is inside at a distance R²/d from the center. Also, the image charge's magnitude is q' = (R^2/d) * q. Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign. I think it's negative because the image charge would be opposite to q to induce the charges.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the potential. The potential at the sphere's surface due to q and q' must be zero. So, if the sphere's radius is R, and the image charge is at a distance r' from the center along the same line as q, then the potential from q at the surface is V_q = k q / (d - R) [no, wait, that's the distance from q to a point on the surface in the direction away from the center. No, wait, no, the distance from q to a point on the surface in the direction towards q is d - R (if d > R). So the potential at that point due to q is k q / (d - R). The potential due to q' (which is at a distance r' from the center along the same line towards q) would be k q' / (R - r'), because the point is on the surface, and the image charge is inside. So the distance between q' and the surface point is (R - r'), right? Because r' is the distance from the center to q', so the surface point is R away, so the separation is R - r'.

Wait, let me think again. The image charge q' is located at a point inside the sphere, a distance r' from the center. The point on the sphere's surface in the direction of q is at a distance (d - R) from q. The same point is (r' + R) away from q'? No, wait, no, the point on the sphere is in the same line as the center, q, and q'. So, if q is at a distance d from the center, and the image charge q' is at a distance r' from the center towards q, then the distance between q and the surface point is (d - R), because the surface point is R away from the center towards q. The distance between q' and the surface point would be (R - r'), because q' is at r' from the center towards q, so the surface point is R away, so the separation is R - r'.

So the potentials at that surface point due to q and q' must add to zero. So,

V_q + V_q' = 0

k q / (d - R) + k q' / (R - r') = 0

We can solve for q' in terms of d and R.

But we also know from the image charge method that for a conducting sphere, the image charge q' is located at a distance r' = (R^2)/d from the center. So r' = R²/d.

Wait, that sounds right. So putting r' = R²/d into the equation:

k q / (d - R) + k q' / (R - R²/d) = 0

Simplify the denominator R - R²/d:

R (1 - R/d) ) = R (d - R)/d

So,

k q / (d - R) + k q' * d/( R (d - R) ) ) = 0

Factor out k/(d-R):

[ q + (q' d)/(R) ) ] = 0

So,

q + (q' d)/(R) = 0

Solving for q':

q' = - (q R ) / d

So the image charge is q' = - (q R)/d

Wait, but earlier I thought the image charge was (R²/d) * q, but that seems different. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the potential at the surface due to q and q' being zero. So,

k q / a + k q' / b = 0,

where a is the distance from q to the surface point in the direction of q, and b is the distance from q' to that same point.

Wait, maybe an easier approach is to remember that the potential at any point on the sphere's surface due to the charge q and the image charge q' must be zero. So,

k q / (d - R) + k q' / (R - r') = 0

But since r' = R²/d,

R - r' = R - R²/d = R (d - R)/d

So,

k q / (d - R) + k q' * d/( R (d - R) ) ) = 0

Factor out [k/(d - R)]:

[ q + (q' * d) / (R) ) ] = 0

So,

q + (q' d) / R = 0

=> q' = - ( q R ) / d

So the image charge is q' = - (q R)/d.

Wait, but that seems a bit off because I thought the image charge is proportional to R²/d. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the potential on the sphere's surface being zero, so the potential due to the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere must cancel.

Wait, the induced charge on the sphere can be thought of as a point charge q_ind located at the center. So the potential at the surface due to q_ind is k q_ind / R. The potential at the surface due to the external charge q is k q / (d - R). For the total potential to be zero,

k q_ind / R + k q / (d - R) ) = 0

So,

q_ind / R = - q / (d - R)

=> q_ind = - R q / (d - R )

Hmm, but this gives q_ind as a function of d and R, but I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.

Alternatively, let's think about the potential energy.

The potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. So bringing charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere. The work done is against the electric field created by the sphere's induced charges.

The sphere, since it's grounded, will have charges induced such that the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is the same as the potential at the sphere's surface.

Wait, no. Because when you bring q close to the sphere, the sphere's induced charges create a potential at that point. But the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. So the potential at the point d is the potential due to the induced charges only.

So the potential energy U is the charge q multiplied by the potential at that point due to the sphere's induced charge.

Wait, but the induced charge on the sphere is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at the point d is the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to the sphere's induced charge. But since the sphere is at zero potential, the potential at d would be zero plus the potential due to the sphere's induced charge.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential created by the sphere. But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is only due to the sphere's induced charges.

Wait, but that's not quite right. The sphere's induced charges create a potential at the point d. When you bring charge q there, you're doing work against that potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring the charge q to its position and the work done to bring the induced charges onto the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges would come from the ground. The total energy would then be the work done to bring q to the point, plus the energy stored in the induced charges.

Wait, maybe the net potential energy is the energy stored in the system, which is the work done to bring q into the potential due to the sphere's induced charge.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

The sphere is conducting and grounded. So when the charge q is placed at a distance d from the center, the sphere will have an induced charge. Let's call the induced charge Q. Because the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero.

The potential on the sphere's surface is the sum of the potentials due to q and Q:

V_surface = V_q + V_Q = 0

V_q is the potential due to q at the sphere's surface, which is k q / (d') where d' is the distance from q to the sphere's surface. But the distance from q to the surface along the line towards the center is (d - R), so V_q = k q/(d - R). Wait, but that's only if the point is on the same side as q. However, the potential due to a point charge is a scalar, so the potential is the same at all points on the sphere's surface? No, that's not correct. The potential on the sphere's surface varies depending on the point's position relative to q. So perhaps the image method is the right way to go.

Wait, perhaps the potential on the sphere's surface due to q can be found using the image charge approach. The image charge q' is located at a distance r' from the center, along the line connecting q and the center. The image charge satisfies the condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, which means the sum of potentials from q and q' is zero.

Earlier, I found that q' = - (q R)/d and r' = R²/d. Wait, let me double-check that.

If the image charge is at r' = R²/d, then the distance from q to the sphere's surface in the direction towards the sphere is (d - R). The distance from the image charge to the surface point is (R - r') = R - R²/d = R (d - R)/d.

So, the potential at the surface point due to q is V_q = k q/(d - R), and due to q' is V_q' = k q'/(R - r') = k q'/( R (d - R)/d ) = (k q' d )/( R (d - R) )

Setting V_q + V_q' = 0:

k q/(d - R) + (k q' d )/( R (d - R) ) = 0

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + (k q' d )/( R ) = 0

Divide both sides by k:

q + (q' d )/ R = 0

So,

q' = - ( q R ) / d

So the image charge is negative and has magnitude (q R)/d.

Wait, but I thought the image charge was (R²/d) q. Maybe I mixed up some steps. Hmm, but the derivation seems correct here.

So, the image charge is q' = - (q R)/d.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the presence of the induced charges on the sphere.

But, since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is the same as the potential due to the image charge q'.

Wait, no. The potential at point d is the potential due to q and the image charge q', but since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero, which includes the contributions from q and q'.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy U is given by the work done to bring q from infinity to its position, which is the integral of the electric field from the image charge. So,

U = q * V,

where V is the potential at the point d due to the image charge q'.

But wait, the image charge is inside the sphere, so the potential at the point d due to the image charge is:

V = k q' / (d - r'), because the image charge is at r' = R²/d, and the point d is along the same line.

Wait, the distance between q (at d) and q' (at R²/d) is d - R²/d.

So,

V = k q' / (d - R²/d) = k q' d / (d² - R²)

Substituting q' = - q R / d,

V = k ( - q R/d ) * d / (d² - R² ) = - k q R / (d² - R² )

So the potential at the point where q is placed is V = - k q R / (d² - R² )

But the potential energy U is q * V, which would be:

U = q * ( - k q R / (d² - R² ) ) = - k q² R / (d² - R² )

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R² / (d² - R² )

Hmm, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy of the system involves both the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the energy stored in the charge q and the energy stored in the induced charge, but since the sphere is grounded, maybe only part of that contributes.

Wait, no, the potential energy U of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges come from the ground without any energy cost, so the potential energy would only be due to the charge q and the image charge.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity, which is the integral of the electric field created by the sphere's induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere's induced charges create a potential that is the same as the potential due to the image charge. So the potential at the point where q is placed is V = k q'/(d - r').

As calculated earlier, V = - k q R / (d² - R² )

So the work done to bring q from infinity to that point is U = q * V = - k q² R / (d² - R² )

But looking at the options, none of them have just R in the numerator. Option C has R squared, option A has d times q squared, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge. Let me go back.

Another approach: The potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

In this case, the charge q and the induced charge Q. But the induced charge Q on the sphere is such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, but the induced charge Q on the sphere would cause a potential at the point where q is placed. The potential energy is the product of q and the potential at that point due to Q.

So, V = k Q / (distance from Q to q )

What is the distance from Q to q? The sphere's radius is R, and the charge q is at a distance d from the center, so the distance between q and the sphere is (d - R) if aligned.

Wait, but the induced charges on the sphere are distributed such that the potential on the sphere is zero. So, the potential at any point on the sphere due to q and Q is zero.

But the potential at the point where q is placed (d away from center) is due to the induced charge Q.

So,

V = k Q / (d - R)

Thus, U = q * V = k q Q / (d - R)

But we need to find Q. How?

Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the surface is zero. So, the potential at the surface due to q and Q is zero.

The potential at the surface due to q is V_q = k q / (R) * (1/(d/R - 1)) )? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for a point charge q outside a sphere, the potential at the sphere's surface is given by the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to the induced charge Q.

Wait, maybe I should model the sphere's induced charge as a point charge at the center. So, the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = k q/(d - R), and due to Q is V_Q = k Q/R.

Wait, but that's only correct if Q is a point charge at the center. Hmm, but perhaps not. Wait, for a conducting sphere, the induced charge can be treated as a point charge at the center for the purpose of calculating potentials outside the sphere.

So, the potential on the sphere's surface is V = V_q + V_Q = 0.

So,

k q/(d - R) + k Q/R = 0

=> Q/R = - q/(d - R)

=> Q = - q R/(d - R)

Now, substituting Q into U:

U = k q Q/(d - R) = k q ( - q R/(d - R) ) / (d - R )

= - k q² R / (d - R )²

But wait, that gives us U = - k q² R / (d - R )^2

Looking at the options, none seem to match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential created by the sphere's induced charge.

But the induced charge Q on the sphere is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed (d from center) is the potential due to Q.

Wait, but since the sphere's induced charge is at a distance d from the point where q is placed, the potential at that point is V = k Q / (d - R). Because the sphere's radius is R, the distance from the center to q is d, so the distance from the induced charge (at center) to q is d - R.

But then, the potential energy U is U = q * V = q * (k Q/(d - R) )

We found earlier that Q = - q R/(d - R )

So,

U = q * [ k ( - q R/(d - R) ) / (d - R) ) ]

= - k q² R / (d - R )^2

Hmm, which again doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the image method. The image charge inside the sphere is q' = - q R/d, located at a distance r' = R²/d from the center.

The potential energy U is the work done to bring q and the image charge q' into their positions. So the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between q and q', and between q' and any other charges (but there are none here).

Wait, but since the image charge is a mathematical construct, perhaps the actual potential energy is only due to the work done in assembling q and the induced charges.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system could be considered as the potential energy between charge q and the image charge q', which would be:

U = k q q' / (distance between them )

The distance between q (at d) and q' (at R²/d) is d - R²/d.

So,

U = k ( q ) ( - q R/d ) / ( d - R²/d )

Simplify the denominator:

d - ( R²/d ) = (d² - R²)/d

So,

U = k ( - q² R/d ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= k ( - q² R/d ) * (d/(d² - R²) )

= - k q² R / (d² - R² )

But looking at the options, option C is U=-(1/2) k q² R²/(d² -R² ), which is different.

Hmm, but I'm getting U = -k q² R/(d² - R² )

Which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge setup.

Wait, perhaps the image method gives the potential energy as (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the distance between them. Because when you assemble a system of charges, the potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions, each divided by 2 to avoid double-counting.

Wait, yes! Because the potential energy between two charges is often written as (1/2) k q1 q2 / r. So, when calculating the potential energy of the system, you take half of each pair's contribution.

So, in this case, the potential energy U would be half of the product of q and q' over the distance between them.

So,

U = (1/2) * k q q' / (distance between q and q')

We found q' = - q R/d, and the distance between q and q' is d - R²/d.

So,

distance = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d

So,

U = (1/2) * k * q * ( - q R/d ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify:

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R ) / (d² - R² )

= - (1/2) k q² R / (d² - R² )

Looking at the options, option D is U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R^2 )

Wait, option D is exactly this.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the potential energy didn't include the 1/2 factor. But considering that the potential energy between two charges is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r, then yes, the correct approach includes this factor.

So, the net potential energy is U = - (1/2) k q² R / (d² - R² )

Which matches option D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere being grounded ensures that its potential is zero, and any induced charges on the sphere redistribute to maintain this condition.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges and Image Charge Method**:  
   When the charge \( q \) is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface. Using the method of images, the sphere can be modeled as having an image charge \( q' \) inside it, located at a distance \( r' = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, along the line connecting \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is \( q' = -\frac{q R}{d} \).

2. **Potential Energy Calculation**:  
   The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble the charges \( q \) and \( q' \). Since the potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r},
   \]
   we calculate the potential energy between \( q \) and \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) (at \( d \)) and \( q' \) (at \( \frac{R^2}{d} \)) is:
   \[
   r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{q R}{d} \), the potential energy is:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \cdot \left(-\frac{q R}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression with the given options, the correct match is:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]
