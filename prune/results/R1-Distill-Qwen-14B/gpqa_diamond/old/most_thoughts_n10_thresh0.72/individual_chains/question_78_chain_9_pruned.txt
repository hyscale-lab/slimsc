Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field generated by a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point r and time t, considering a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The setup mentions that t is greater than tr, which I think is the time when the charge was at a certain position that affects the field at the current time t. So, it's about retarded potentials, I think.

Wait, right, retarded time. Because the effect of the charge's motion isn't instantaneous; there's a delay. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated at time tr (retarded time) to the observation point r. So, if the charge is moving, the field at r and t depends on where the charge was (and its velocity) at time tr, which is earlier than t.

The velocity at the retarded time tr is given as v. Oh, but wait, v is the velocity at tr, right? So for the potentials, I need to consider both the position and the velocity at that earlier time.

Now, scalar potential V is usually due to the charge's electric field. For a stationary charge, V would be (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point of observation. But when the charge is moving, I think the scalar potential might be affected by the motion as well. Or do I? Wait, no, I think the scalar potential is primarily determined by the charge's position at the retarded time. So maybe V is similar to the static case, but with the retarded distance.

Wait, but in the problem, the options have different expressions. Let me think. The scalar potential for a moving charge should still depend on the charge's position at the retarded time. So, V would be q divided by something involving the distance d. Because d is the vector from the retarded position to r, so the magnitude of d would be the distance between the two points.

But wait, no, because the charge's position at tr is s(tr), and r is the observation point. So the vector from s(tr) to r is d. So the distance
