Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with benzene. Each step transforms the product into the next. The final product is one of the four options given. My goal is to figure out which option is correct.

So, let's break down each step one by one.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.

I remember that nitration is a common reaction where benzene reacts with a nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) mixture. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, and the nitronium ion (NO2+) is the electrophile. The nitration typically occurs at the meta position when the ring is activated, but wait, benzene is just benzene. Oh wait, no, benzene is an unactivated ring. So, the nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the nitro group? Or wait, no. Wait, benzene is being nitrated without any substituents, so the product should be nitrobenzene. But nitro group is a meta-directing group. Wait, but in the first step, it's just benzene reacting. Oh, wait no, the product would be nitrobenzene, right? Because benzene has no substituents, so the nitration adds a nitro group, which is a meta director. Wait, no, the nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, which is a meta-directing group. But in this case, since the initial benzene has no substituents, the nitro group would be attached in any position, but in reality, it's a single productâ€”nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, no, wait. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene as the major product. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.

Hmm. So product 1 is nitrobenzene. What reaction does it undergo with Br2 and Fe? I think that's a bromination reaction. Oh wait, in the presence of FeBr3, but wait, in this case, the reagent
