Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? Density equals mass over volume. So the question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the four options given.

Let me read the options again. 

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. I think Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, no, wait—wait, Earth's average density is around 5.51 g/cm³. Yeah, so if a planet has the same mass and radius as Earth, its density is the same as Earth's, which is about 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, density is given here. So if the density is the same as Earth's, then no matter the mass and radius, because density is mass/volume. So for this planet, density is 5.5, same as Earth, so I don't think it's higher than option a. But wait, option a is Earth-like, so same density, same mass, same radius. So option b's density is same as a.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm. Same composition implies same density? Because composition affects both mass and volume. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm
