Okay, let me try to work through this problem. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms attached at the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with strong bases, I think they typically undergo elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Because it's a dibromide, maybe an E2 mechanism? So two elimination steps could happen, but how?

Wait, wait. Adamantane is a very rigid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, in the adamantane structure, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are adjacent. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves, but since there's a di-substitution, maybe it forms a diene? Or maybe the two Brs are removed, and the double bonds form between each of their positions, but wait, that might not make sense.

Wait, elimination would remove H and Br from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. But since there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations occur. But wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe each elimination forms a double bond, but since it's a di-substituted, maybe the product would be an allene? Or perhaps a bridged diene?

Wait, another thought. When vicinal dihalides (adjacent) react with strong bases, they typically eliminate to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on carbons that are not adjacent. Are they across a bridge or something else?

Wait, no, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent. Because I think the structure is such that each carbon is connected to two others in a diamondoid structure. So, if Br is on 1 and 3, they're adjacent, right? So in that case, when KOH is added, each Br would undergo elimination, but since
