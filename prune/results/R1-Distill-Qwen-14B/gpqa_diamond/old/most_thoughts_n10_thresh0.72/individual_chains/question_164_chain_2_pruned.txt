Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

Alright, so there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods. System_1's period is 2 years, and system_2's is 1 year. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses, right? So that's the orbital period of the binary system.

Then there's spectroscopic data about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the velocities have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. Oh wait, I think in binary systems, each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so its RV variation is smaller. Because the less massive star would be moving faster, right? So the mass ratio would affect the RV amplitudes.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Wait, the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses. So I need to find M1_total / M2_total.

Wait, but how do I calculate their masses? I remember there's a formula for the mass function in spectroscopic binaries. Oh right! The mass function relates the RV semi-amplitudes to the masses.

The mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1)
