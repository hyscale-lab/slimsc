Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, let's recap what I know. The uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is given by the standard deviation in its measurement when the system is in a particular state. Mathematically, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z.

So, the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩²).

But wait, since the state is given, maybe I can compute these expectation values directly.

The state ψ is given as the column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
    [ 1/√2 ]
    [ -1/2 ]

Wait, but it's a column vector, so each component is a row here. So ψ is a 3x1 vector.

Next, I need the matrix for P_z. It's given as:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† would be the conjugate transpose. But looking at the given ψ, the components are real, so ψ† is just the transpose.

Let me compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Each component of ψ is real, so ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

The matrix P_z is diagonal, so when I multiply ψ† by P_z, each element will get multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So, ψ† P_z is [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ] → [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

Wait
