Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are related to scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. Oh right, the scattering amplitude is usually a function of different angular momentum states. So each δ_l corresponds to a specific l value, right? Like δ₀ is for l=0, δ₁ for l=1, and so on.

The problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we only consider the given ones. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) comes into play here. I think the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum over l [ (2l+1) * (sin δ_l - δ_l) ) / (sin(δ_l)) * ( ... ) ] Wait, no, that's not quite right. Oh right, the general expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l) [ P_l(cosθ) ]

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident beam direction is when θ=0, because the angle between the initial and final momentum is zero. So when θ=0, what do the spherical harmonics or the Legendre polynomials P_l do?

The Legendre polynomials P_l(x) evaluated at x=1 (since cosθ=1 when θ=0) is 1 for even l and 0 for odd l? No wait, actually P₀(1)=1, P₁(1)=1, P₂(1)=1/3, etc. Wait, no, for P_l(1), it's always 1 for any l. Because when x=1, all the Legendre polynomials equal 1. Wait, is that true? Wait, Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are 1 for all l, yes. Because substituting x=1 into P_l(x) gives 1 regardless of l.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is
