Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about two reactions, and I have to determine the major products A and B from each. Then, I choose the correct option from the given choices.

Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, potassium hydride (KH), and then H+. So the first part is to figure out what happens here.

Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacts with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, which is LDA. I need to find out the product B here.

Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atomâ€”in this case, the spiro atom is the one where the two rings meet. The structure seems like a bicyclic system. The formula is a bit complicated, but I think the structure is a spiro ring with a 5-membered ring and a 7-membered ring, I guess. Wait, no, wait: the spiro notation is [3.5], which means the molecule is formed by two rings connected at a single atom. The first ring is 3 carbons (so a three-membered ring?), but wait, that doesn't make much sense. Oh wait, no: the spiro notation is [n.m], where n and m are the number of carbons in each ring. So spiro[3.5]non would have a nine-carbon structure? Wait, no. Let's think: the 'non' part is 9 carbons. The spiro rings would split the nine carbons into two rings. So spiro[3.5]non would be a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring connected at one carbon. But wait, that would require 3 +5 +1 (the connecting carbon) = 9, but the formula would be C9H14O? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex.

Wait, the actual structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, spiro indicates two rings. The non is 9 carbons, so the main chain has 9 carbons, but arranged in a spiro fashion. The substituents are at positions 1 and 5. So the molecule has two rings: one is a three-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and another a five-membered ring, connected at the first carbon. The first carbon also has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), and the structure has a double bond at position 5. Oh, wait, but the formula is more like a bicyclic structure.

So for Reaction A: the reagents are THF as a solvent, KH (potassium hydride) as a base, and then H+ workup. So what reactions are common in such conditions? Potassium hydride is a strong base. In THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. 

The starting material has an alcohol group at position 1. So when treated with a strong base like KH, it's likely that the alcohol is deprotonated. But wait, the starting material is 1-vinyl-spiro...en-1-ol. So the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the vinyl group. That's a secondary alcohol, perhaps? Wait, the structure might have the OH on a bridgehead carbon, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, when you deprotonate an alcohol, you get an alkoxide. But what's next?

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of a base, the molecule might undergo elimination. But the starting alcohol is adjacent to a double bond (since it's 5-en). So perhaps it's an E2 elimination, forming a more substituted double bond.

Wait, the starting structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the OH is on carbon 1, which is part of the spiro system. Also, there's a double bond at position 5. So if the OH is at 1 and a double bond at 5, perhaps the base could abstract a proton leading to an elimination reaction, forming a new double bond.

Wait, but the reaction is done in two steps: first with KH, which is a strong base, then H+ workup. So perhaps the base deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which could then undergo some
