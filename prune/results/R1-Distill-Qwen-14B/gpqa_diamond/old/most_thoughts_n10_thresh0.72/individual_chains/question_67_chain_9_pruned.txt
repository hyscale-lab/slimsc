Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let me think. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, so the setup is that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. Wait, but orbital angular momentum in quantum mechanics is quantized, right? So L_z has eigenvalues mħ, where m can be -l, ..., +l.

So for each electron, since l is 1, the possible m values for each are -1, 0, +1. So L1z can be -ħ, 0, or ħ. Same for L2z.

The state we're in is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator J_z (which would be L1z + L2z) with eigenvalue mħ. Wait, but wait, in this case, the coupled state has l=2 and m=-1. So that means (L1z + L2z) |state> = (-ħ) |state>. So the sum of the two individual m's (m1 and m2) would be -1. Because m = m1 + m2.

So the problem is asking: what's the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1? So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because then their sum would be -2, but wait, in our case m is -1. Hmm, that can't be. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So when you have two p orbitals (each l=1), the possible total l can be 2, 1, or 0. Here it's 2. So the state is a combination of the possible ways to get l=
