Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read what it's about.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL, right? And it contains 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The temperature is 25°C, and we're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄³⁻ or PO₄³⁻?) in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out the molarity of each of these salts in the solution and then determine how they contribute to the concentration of orthophosphate ions.

Wait, but wait—KH₂PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are phosphates, right? So they'll dissociate in solution. Let me think about their dissociation.

KH₂PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, I think it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So the formula is: KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻. So each mole of KH₂PO4 gives one mole of H₂PO4^-.

Na₂HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate. Wait, no, wait. Na₂HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, and the formula given includes 2 H2O. So when it dissolves, the 2H2O would just be absorbed into the solution as water. So the dissociation would be Na₂HPO4 → 2Na⁺ + HPO4²⁻. So each mole of Na₂HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4²⁻.

So the solution contains both H₂PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Oh, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or is it PO4^3-? Wait, no, wait. H3PO4 can lose three protons to become PO4^3-, so that's the orthophosphate ion. But HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, and H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate.

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. So that's PO4^3-.

But wait, the problem statement says 'orthophosphate ions.' I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate. Wait, no, I think the orthophosphate is the PO4^3
