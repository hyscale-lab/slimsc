Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think I should verify if that's a normalized state. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector needs to have a norm of 1. Let me calculate the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. Oh, right, so it's not normalized. That might complicate things because probabilities depend on normalization. Maybe the state is given as a vector, and the question expects me to normalize it first? Or perhaps it's okay because when calculating probabilities, the normalization will take care of itself somehow. I'll keep that in mind.

Next, the operators for observables P and Q are given. The matrix for P has elements such that the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). And the matrix for Q is diagonal: (1, 0, -1) along the diagonal.

The question is asking for the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q when first measuring P and then Q. So the order is P first, then Q. But wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P, the state would be in an eigenstate of P. Then, when you measure Q, you're looking at the state after this collapse.

Wait, but P and Q might not commute, so their measurements are not independent. But in this case, since we're measuring P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, and then Q is measured on that new state.

But wait, to find the probabilities, I think I should first find the possible outcomes for P and Q, then consider the measurement process.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Normalize the state vector if necessary.
2. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of operator P. Because when we measure P, the state collapses into one of the eigenvectors of P, with probability given by the square of the amplitude.
3. For each possible eigenvalue of P (including 0), determine the corresponding eigenvectors.
4. Then, after measuring P=0, the state is projected onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0. Since the state may be a combination of multiple eigenvectors, but if the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's straightforward.
5. Then, compute the expectation for measuring Q on this new state. Specifically, find the probability of getting -1 for Q.

Wait, but the measurement of P is first, and we want the case where P=0. So, I need to find the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, project the initial state onto this eigenvector. The coefficient squared will be the probability of getting 0 for P.

Wait, but perhaps P has more than one eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0. So the eigenspace could be more than one-dimensional. In that case, the projection might not be unique, but the probabilities would sum over the basis vectors of that eigenspace. But let's proceed step by step.

First, I'll write down the matrix for operator P.

P matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm. To find the eigenvalues, I'll need to find the determinant of (P - λI) = 0.

But this might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for symmetries or patterns in the matrix that might help me find the eigenvalues.

Looking at the matrix, I notice that it's a symmetric matrix, so it should be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Another approach is to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues by assuming possible solutions.

When λ = 0:

The equation is P|v> = 0.

So, for each component:

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as equation 1, so v2=0.

So equation 2 gives v1 = -v3. Let me set v3 = a (a free parameter), then v1 = -a, and v2=0. So the eigenvector is (-a, 0, a). Since a is arbitrary, we can take a=1, so the eigenvector is (-1, 0, 1). But wait, wait: I think maybe I miscalculated. Let me check the equations again.

Wait, in equation 2, when λ=0, the equation is (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0. So v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvector would be (v1, 0, -v1). Let me pick v1=1, so (1, 0, -1). Wait, but earlier I thought it was (-1, 0, 1). Oh, but that's just scaling by -1, same direction. So the eigenvector for λ=0 is (1, 0, -1) up to a scalar multiple.

Wait, but let me also check if the other equations are satisfied. So when v2=0, equation 3 is (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0, which is satisfied.

So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). Let me normalize this vector. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the only eigenvector for λ=0. Let me see. The trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

But what are the other eigenvalues? Let's see. Another approach: perhaps P has a specific structure. Let me consider that P is a symmetric matrix. The eigenvectors could include some symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by other means. Let me try to find the characteristic equation.

The matrix P is:

[ 0          1/√2      0        ]
[1/√2       0         1/√2     ]
[ 0          1/√2      0        ]

So the characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

The determinant of:

| -λ     1/√2        0      |
|1/√2   -λ         1/√2    |
| 0      1/√2      -λ       |

Calculating this determinant:

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * det[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) )  ] 
Minus (1/sqrt(2)) * det[ ... ] 
Plus 0 * something.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant using expansion or row operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take a guess at the eigenvalues. Let's see.

Suppose λ is some value. Let me try for λ=0 first, which we've done.

Another approach: perhaps there are symmetries in the matrix. Let's see, the matrix has a sort of rotational symmetry in the positions. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, but that's just a guess.

Wait, let me compute the determinant.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it out in more detail.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
+ 0 * [ something ]

Wait, perhaps I should use the rule for 3x3 determinants. Alternatively, perhaps I can perform row operations to simplify.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the matrix is symmetric and find the eigenvalues another way.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me see.

We found one eigenvalue, which is 0, with eigenvector (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2). Now, let's find the other eigenvalues.

Another idea: the trace of P is zero, so if the eigenvalues are a, b, c, then a + b + c = 0.

The trace of P is 0, which is the sum of the diagonal elements.

The determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. Hmm. Let's calculate the determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are symmetric. Let me try λ = 1 and λ = -1.

Wait, let's consider λ=1. Does (P - I) have a non-trivial solution?

P - I is:

[ -1   1/√2    0 ]
[1/√2 -1    1/√2 ]
[ 0    1/√2  -1 ]

I think I can try plugging in λ=1 into the determinant and see if it's zero.

The determinant of this matrix:

Row 1: -1, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -1, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -1

Calculating this determinant:

Let me expand along the first row.

-1 * det( [ -1, 1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2), -1 ] ) 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2); 0, -1] )
+ 0 * something

First term: -1 * [ (-1)(-1) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
= -1 * [ 1 - (1/2) ) ] 
= -1 * (1/2) = -1/2.

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) ]
= -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) 
= -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) = (1)*(1/2) = 1/2.

Third term is zero.

So the determinant is (-1/2) + (1/2) = 0. So yes, λ=1 is an eigenvalue.

Similarly, let's check λ=-1.

P + I is:

[ 1   1/sqrt(2)   0 ]
[1/sqrt(2)   1    1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0   1/sqrt(2)   1 ]

Calculating determinant.

Again, expanding along the first row:

1 * det( [1, 1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2), 1] )
- (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2); 0, 1] )
+ 0 * something.

First term: 1 * [ (1)(1) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ]
= 1 * [ 1 - (1/2) ) ] 
= 1*(1/2) = 1/2.

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))(1) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) ]
= -(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) 
= -(1/2).

Third term: 0.

So the determinant is (1/2) - (1/2) = 0. So λ=-1 is also an eigenvalue.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, -1.

So for P, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Now, the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 would be important as well, but perhaps for the problem at hand, the important part is the eigenvector for λ=0.

Earlier, we found that the eigenvector for λ=0 is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So now, the initial state is given as the vector (-1, 2, 1). But we need to normalize it first because the probabilities depend on the norm.

So the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).

Let me write this as a column vector:

ψ = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The probability of getting outcome 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of ψ in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to 0.

The eigenvector for 0 is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2). Let's call this |v0>.

So the amplitude is the inner product of ψ and v0.

So, amplitude a = ψ^† v0 = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Calculating each term:

First term: (-1/sqrt(6))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) = -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = -1/sqrt(12) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = -1/sqrt(12) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).

So the sum is (-1/(2√3)) + 0 + (-1/(2√3)) ) = -2/(2√3) ) = -1/√3.

The amplitude is -1/√3. The probability is the square of the amplitude's absolute value: (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the system collapses into the eigenvector |v0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q on this new state. The operator Q is diagonal:

Q = diag(1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The eigenvectors are:

For 1: (1, 0, 0)
For 0: any vector in the y-axis, but since Q is diagonal, probably the standard basis vectors. Wait, no. The Q operator has 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So the eigenstates of Q are:

|q1> = (1, 0, 0) for Q=1,

|q0> = (0, 1, 0) for Q=0,

|q-1> = (0, 0, 1) for Q=-1.

Wait, no. Because the operator Q is diagonal, so each basis vector is an eigenvector. So |q1> is [1; 0; 0], |q-1> is [0; 0;1].

Now, the state after P=0 measurement is |v0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

We need to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, which is the eigenvalue corresponding to |q-1>.

The probability is the square of the amplitude of |q-1> in |v0>.

The amplitude is the inner product of |v0> and |q-1>.

So, <q-1 | v0> = 0*1/sqrt(2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1)/sqrt(2) ) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The square is (1/2), so the probability is 1/2.

Wait, but wait: no, because the state |v0> is already (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2), which is a normalized vector. So the inner product with |q-1> is (0,0,1) · (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) = (-1)/sqrt(2). The amplitude is -1/sqrt(2), so |amplitude|^2 is (1/2).

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1. So that's the product of the probability of P=0 and then, given that, the probability of Q=-1.

Wait, no, actually, the probability is P(P=0) multiplied by P(Q=-1 | P=0).

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. When we measure P=0, the state becomes |v0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). Then, when measuring Q on this state, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q, which are 1,0,-1, but wait, no: the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. So the state |v0> is an eigenstate of Q? Wait, no, because |v0> is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) and Q is diagonal, so applying Q to |v0> gives:

Q |v0> = [1*1/sqrt(2), 0*0, (-1)*(-1/sqrt(2))] = [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)].

Wait, no. Wait, operator Q is diagonal, so it's element-wise multiplication. So when you apply Q to |v0>, you get:

Q |v0> = [1*(1/sqrt(2)), 0*(0), (-1)*(-1/sqrt(2))] = [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)].

Wait, but that's not a scalar multiple of |v0>, unless 1/sqrt(2) is equal to -1/sqrt(2), which it's not. So |v0> is not an eigenstate of Q. So when you measure Q after P=0, you have to express |v0> as a linear combination of Q's eigenstates and find the probabilities.

But wait, earlier I thought that the state |v0> is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). Let me write this as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The eigenstates of Q are |q1> = (1, 0, 0), |q0> = (0, 1, 0), |q-1> = (0, 0, 1).

So to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, which corresponds to |q-1>, I compute the inner product of |v0> with |q-1>.

So:

⟨q-1 | v0⟩ = (0, 0, 1) · (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) ) = (0 * 1/sqrt(2)) + (0 * 0) + (1 * (-1/sqrt(2))) ) = -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.

Therefore, the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.


The problem involves determining the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in sequence for a quantum system. The initial state is given as \( \psi = (-1, 2, 1)^T \), which is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

By solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), the eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( \lambda = 1, 0, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of the component of \( \psi \) in the direction of \( |v_0\rangle \). The amplitude is:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \langle v_0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after \( P = 0 \) measurement
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses into the state \( |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |q_1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), \( |q_0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), and \( |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of the component of \( |v_0\rangle \) in the direction of \( |q_{-1}\rangle \). The amplitude is:

\[
\langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \left| \langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Joint probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]
