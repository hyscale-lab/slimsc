Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titration of acetic acid with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the right one.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka given is 1.85e-5.

Wait, so first, I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. Oh right, volume in liters. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the concentration becomes moles / total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid after dilution.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point comes when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. So let's think about that.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / Molarity. So moles are 0.001, and Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question is about 25% titration, so that's a quarter of the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

But wait, I think that for the 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. So yes, 2.5 cm³. So, at that point, how much of the acetic acid has reacted?

The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Because 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L.

Initially, we had 0.001 moles of acetic acid. So after adding NaOH, moles of acetic acid
