Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with some spots and how those spots affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted versus when it is. The transition corresponds to about 1448 Angstroms, and LTE is assumed.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. In LTE, the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation, right? So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ).

But wait, E here is the energy difference between the two levels. So if the ratio decreases when there are spots, that must be because when T decreases, the ratio changes.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ). Because E2 > E1, so ΔE is positive. So when T increases, the exponential increases, making the ratio n1/n2 bigger. Wait, no: because the exponent is negative. So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative. So exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say E2 > E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

If T increases, -ΔE/(k T) becomes less negative, so the exponential becomes larger. So n1/n2 would be larger when T is higher.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall T decreases. So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't (higher T). So the ratio decreases, which matches the observation.

So the ratio without spots is higher, with spots is lower. So the question is, what's the factor by which this ratio changes when going from no spots to spots.

So the ratio factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, since they're the same for both.

So the factor becomes exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Alternatively, factor is exp( ΔE/(k
