Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which relates to the area of their event horizon. Let's think about how to approach this.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. We need to find the entropy's order of magnitude.

Wait, I remember the formula that relates the entropy of a black hole to its area. I think it's S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's hbar (ħ), gravitational constant G, speed of light c, and Boltzmann's constant k_B. But wait, I've also heard it simplified as S ≈ (A)/(4 l_p^2), where l_p is the Planck length. Oh right, because l_p squared is ħ G/(c^3) or something like that.

So first, I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4π r², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate r directly. Since they gave me the angular size θ, perhaps I can find the actual size using θ = d * (r / d) = r / d? Wait, no, more accurately, the angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size of the object divided by the distance, for small angles.
