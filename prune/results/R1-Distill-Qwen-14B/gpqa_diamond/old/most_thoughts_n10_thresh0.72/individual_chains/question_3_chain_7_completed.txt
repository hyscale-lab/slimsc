Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. 

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific linear superposition. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator, which I remember is the Pauli z-matrix. So σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively.

The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, expectation values can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this. Let me break it down.

First, expectation value for an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I need to compute this for each part of the operator and then add them together.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. I can compute each expectation separately.

Starting with ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz in the state ψ is just the sum of the squares of the coefficients multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think. The state is a linear combination: ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ = |a|² * (+1) + |b|² * (-1). Because σz|↑⟩= +|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩= -|↓⟩.

Let me compute |a|² and |b|². 

a is 0.5, so |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

b is sqrt(3)/2. So |b|² is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. This is trickier because σx isn't diagonal in the |↑⟩, |↓⟩ basis. So I'll have to compute it using the matrix representation or via expansion.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is typically [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], so ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The operator σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, let's write it out.

Alternatively, I can compute it algebraically.

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓| ) * σx * (0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ )

Expanding this, it's 0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx|↑⟩ is |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ is |↑⟩. So,

⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↑| ↓ ⟩ = 0,
⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = ⟨↑| ↑ ⟩ = 1,
⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↓| ↓ ⟩ =1,
⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ =0.

Putting it together:

= (0.25)(0) + (0.5*sqrt(3)/2)(1) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5)(1) + (3/4)(0)
= 0 + (sqrt(3)/4)*1 + (sqrt(3)/4)*1 + 0 
= (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 ) 
= sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... 

Then, 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 * 0.8660 ≈4.3301.

Adding the two parts together: -5 + 4.3301 ≈-0.6699.

Wait wait, but the options are given in one decimal places. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation of ⟨σx⟩. Maybe I made a mistake.

Another way to compute expectation value is to use the formula ⟨σx⟩ = (ψ† σx ψ). Let me write ψ as a vector:

ψ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]

So σx ψ would be [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ]

Then ψ† (the conjugate transpose, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ]) multiplied by this gives:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 

That's 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= (sqrt(3)/2) * (0.5 *2) ?

Wait, let me compute each term:

(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, same as before. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.8660 ≈4.3301.

So the total expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) +4.3301 ≈-0.6699.

Wait, but the question says up to one decimal place.

So -0.6699 rounds to -0.7. Checking the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making any calculation errors.

Wait, let me compute 10⟨σz⟩ again. ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) is -5.

5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2). sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 1.732/2 is 0.866. Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.866 =4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33= -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the expectation value is -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be option C.


To calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) of \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Calculating \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \):
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is not diagonal in the \( |\uparrow\rangle, |\downarrow\rangle \) basis. Its matrix representation is:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) can be written as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Calculating \( \sigma_x | \psi \):
\[
\sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Now, compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Expanding the dot product:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5, \quad 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately **-0.7**.
