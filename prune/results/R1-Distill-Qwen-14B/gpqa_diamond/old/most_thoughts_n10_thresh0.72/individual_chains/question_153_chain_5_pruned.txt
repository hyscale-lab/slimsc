Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products for three different reactions and match them with the options given. Let's take it step by step.

First off, I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This forms an enolate intermediate, leading to the product. The conditions usually involve a base, like NaOEt or KOH, and a solvent like EtOH or H2O.

Let's look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, acting as the enolate source. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. 

In a Michael addition, the enolate (from the malonate) will attack the beta position of the acrylate. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with the p-tolyl group instead of one of the CH3. Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: the acrylate has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituents are on carbon 3. So, structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OR, but wait, the position is 3, so it's actually CH2-CH2-C(O)OR with a substituent on the third carbon. Wait, no, wait. The correct structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the correct structure of 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate is an ester with the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the substituent is on the third carbon. Oh wait, that's not possible because acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the numbering is: 1, 2, 3. So 3 would be the COOCH3's carbon? No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify: the structure of 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Hmm, perhaps it's more accurate to think it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be for a different position. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C-CH2-COOCH3 but with the middle CH2 having the p-tolyl group, but that doesn't make sense because that's the third position.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the double bond being between carbons 1 and 2, and the ester group is on carbon 3. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3. But that's but-3-en-2-olate? Hmm, perhaps I
