Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. So, we've got two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods; system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. The question is about finding out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are given, and I need to figure out the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity (RV) method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The RV variations are sinusoidal because the stars orbit a common center of mass. The amplitude of these variations relates to the mass of the companion star.

Wait, the key here is probably the mass function and Kepler's laws. Oh right, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the sum of the masses and the size of the orbit. But since both systems are binaries, we can use the radial velocity data to find each star's mass.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of each star in a binary system is given by the formula K = (v * sin i) where v is the orbital speed. But more importantly, each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass because they're orbiting a common center of mass. So if one star is more massive, it will have a smaller velocity (since it's moving less for the same gravitational pull).

In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. So star A has a velocity of 10, star B 5. That means the mass of star A is (v_B)/(v_A) times the mass of star B. Because the ratio of masses is inverse to the ratio of velocities. So m_A/m_B = v_B / v_A = 5/10 = 0.5. So m_A is half of m_B. Therefore, the total mass of system 1 is m_A + m_B = (0.5 m_B) + m_B = 1.5 m_B.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, another approach is that the mass function for each star relates their velocity to their mass. The mass function is f(m) = (M^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M + m)^2 (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ), but since the eccentricity e is probably negligible (e=0 for circular orbits, which is a common assumption), and the inclination i is 90 degrees (since they eclipse), sin i is 1. So for each star, f(m) would be (M^3) / ( (M + m)^2 ). But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. The ratio of the masses is the inverse ratio of their velocities. Because the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, hence a slower velocity if the orbital period is the same. So in system_1, star A has velocity 10, star B 5. So m_A/m_B = (v_B)/(v_A) = 5/10 = 0.5. So m_A = 0.5 m_B.

So the total mass of system_1 is m_A + m_B = 0.5 m_B + m_B = 1.5 m_B.

Similarly, in system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. So star A has 15, star B 10. So m_A/m_B = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666. So m_A = (2/3) m_B. The total mass is m_A + m_B = (2/3 + 1) m_B = (5/3) m_B.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the periods are different. System_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 of 1 year. So does that affect the mass calculation? Because Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M+m))/(4π²). But without knowing the semi-major axis, how do we relate it?

Alternatively, the mass function for a binary system is M = (K^3 P) / (2π G) ) * ( (1 + q)^2 / (1 + q) ), where q is the mass ratio. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, another approach: Using the fact that the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. So for each system, the mass ratio is known from the RV amplitudes.

In system_1, m1 is 10 and m2 is 5. So mass ratio m1/m2 = 2. So m2 = m1/2. So total mass is m1 + m2 = m1 + (m1/2) = (3/2) m1.

In system_2, m1 is 15, m2 is 10. So mass ratio is 15/10=3/2. So m2 = (2/3) m1. So total mass is m1 + m2 = m1 + (2/3 m1) = (5/3) m1.

But how does the period factor in here? Because the period depends on the total mass and the size of the orbit.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of binary stars says that the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, but scaled by the total mass. So P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) a³.

But the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) (M sin i) / [ ( (M + m)^(2/3) ) (P)
