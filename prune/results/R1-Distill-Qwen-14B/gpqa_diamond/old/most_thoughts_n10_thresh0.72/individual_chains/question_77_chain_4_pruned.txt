Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two parts. The first part is a reaction involving BuLi and then H+. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, BuLi is a strong base, right? It's used for deprotonation, forming enolates maybe. Wait, but the structure here is a benzene ring attached to an oxygen, which is connected to a methyl group and a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

So the structure is something like benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but in the structure, it's 3-methyl. So the ene is at position 2, and a methyl is at position 3.

So the substituent is (CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2- with the double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no. Let me correct. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as a substituent. So with 3-methyl, so the substituent is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-? Wait, no, that's 3-methyl but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)-. Wait, the structure of the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2
