Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is: there's a planet, let's call it Planet A, with a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit, and it has a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. Planet A's orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet, Planet B, with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period of Planet B such that both transit and occultation events occur. And Planet B also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as Planet A.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit its star, the orbital plane needs to be edge-on to our line of sight. But more importantly, for both transit and occultation to happen, Planet B must pass in front of the star (transit) and also behind the star (occultation) from our point of view. Oh wait, but occultation is when the planet is behind the star, right? So, for both events, the orbital plane must be aligned such that the planet transits the star, and the star transits the planet.

Wait, but maybe I'm thinking of it the other way around. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so it's when the star passes in front of the planet from our view. So for both events to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that the star can pass in front of it (occultation) and the planet can pass in front of the star (transit). That means that the planet must be in a position where it can both eclipse the star and be eclipsed by the star. So the orbital configuration must allow for this.

I think that both transits and occultations require that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on relative to us. So if Planet A is transiting, the orbital inclination is such that we're seeing it edge-on. Therefore, Planet B must also be in the same orbital plane, so it's edge-on too. So both transits and occultations are possible if they're in the same orbital plane and their positions allow for the necessary alignment.

Now, the question is about the maximum orbital period of Planet B. So I guess it's about how far out Planet B can be while still allowing these events to happen.

Wait, but how do the orbital periods relate here? I'm a bit confused. I remember that for a planet to transit another, they must be in a resonant orbit or something? Or maybe it's about the orbital distance and the size of the star.

Wait, maybe the key is that for both the transit and the occultation to occur, the two planets must be aligned in a way that they can pass in front of each other relative to the star. So, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital speeds allow for their positions to coincide in front and behind the star.

Alternatively, perhaps the concept of synodic periods might come into play here. The synodic period is the time between similar configurations as seen from Earth, like conjunctions. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the transit timing. For Planet B to both transit and be occulted, its
