Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying a compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, looking at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since there's also a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have both the O-H and C=O groups, so that fits. So the compound is likely a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR. The question says none of the peaks are from vinyl hydrogens, so there are no double bonds in the molecule. That eliminates any possibility of conjugated systems or alkenes.

The NMR has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. Wait, that's a bit complex. Let me break that down. Each coupling splits the peak into a certain pattern. So a doublet (split into two) of triplets (split into three) of quartets (split into four). That suggests a proton that's coupling with multiple sets of neighboring protons. Maybe branching or a geminal situation?

Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, a doublet (two peaks) split into triplets (three) and then each of those split into triplets again. Hmm, maybe this proton is near different sets of protons with varying coupling constants.

Let me look at the possible structures. All the options are carboxylic acids with some branching.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH2CH2... Wait, no, the formula is more like (CH3)(C2H5)C... Maybe it's a structure where the carboxylic acid is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a C that has two substituents (maybe two ethyl groups or something else). Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the carboxylic acid is directly attached to a central carbon, which has four substituents: two ethyl groups, and two CH2CH3 groups? Wait, the formula looks like the COOH is attached to a central carbon that has two ethyl groups and two other CH2CH3 groups. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Let me see, the structure is more like CH2CH2... No, wait, the first part is CH3CH2, then the central C with (C2H5), another (C2H5), and perhaps two CH2CH3 groups?

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the central carbon has two CH3 groups and two more CH2 groups attached to the COOH. Wait, the structure would be (CH3)(CH3)C-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the central carbons each have a methyl group and another CH2CH3... No, maybe it's a geminal di-substituted carbon. So each of the two central carbons are each connected to a CH3 and another group. So perhaps each is a quaternary carbon with two CH3, one CH2CH2... Wait, maybe it's like this: the molecule has two CH(CH3) groups attached to a central chain leading to the COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the COOH is attached to a central carbon which is connected to two CH3 groups and another CH2CH3 group. Or wait, the structure is CH3CH2 connected to a central carbon that has (CH3), another (CH3), and then another CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe the central C is connected to two methyl groups and a CH2CH2 group, and the COOH is directly attached.

Wait, but in each option, the COOH is either on a CH2 group (options A and C) or directly on a central carbon (B and D). Since the NMR doesn't show vinyl hydrogens, it's all single bonds, so the structures are all possible.

The key is the splitting patterns in the NMR. Let me think about the possible structures.

The NMR has a peak that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a complex splitting. Let's think about how many neighboring protons each proton is coupled with.

If a proton is next to a CH2 group, it might split into a triplet. But if it's next to a branch with multiple protons, it could couple with more.

Looking at Option D: Structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central C has two CH3 groups. The -COOH is attached to this central C. So the neighboring groups would be: each H on the central C is attached to a CH3 and another CH3, but wait, each H is on a carbon which also has two CH3 groups. So the structure is something like:

COOH
|
C(H)(CH3)
|
C(H)(CH3)
|
CH2CH3

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So each of the central CH groups has two CH3 and a CH2CH3 group attached.

Wait, perhaps each central CH has two CH3 groups. So each H on the central C is adjacent to two CH3 groups and a CH2CH3 group. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups, one CH2CH3, and the COOH group. So each H on this central C is attached to a CH3, another CH3, a CH2CH3, and the COOH.

Wait, but the central C is CH, which is attached to four groups: two CH3, a CH2CH3, and COOH. Hmm, no, that can't be right because that would make four bonds. Oh, wait, no: the central C is CH, meaning it's attached to three other groups besides the H. So maybe it's:

COOH
|
C(H)(CH3)
|
C(H)(CH3)
|
CH2CH3

So each central C (the two middle Cs) have a H, two CH3 groups, and the next group. Hmm, perhaps more accurate to draw it as CH3CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)-COOH. No, that's not matching the formula.

Wait, the formula for option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, it's CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the structure is: CH3CH2-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH? Wait, no, perhaps it's CH3CH2 attached to a central carbon which is connected to another CH3 and a COOH, but then another CH3 and COOH? I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should think about the possible NMR signals.

In the NMR, the presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets suggests a proton that's coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons. Each coupling would split the peak further.

Alternatively, perhaps the H in question is on a carbon adjacent to a branching point. Let's think about each option:

Option D: The structure would have a carbon chain like CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So the central C has two CH3 groups and a H, and the adjacent C also has two CH3 and a H. The H on each of these central Cs would be adjacent to the H on the neighboring C and perhaps other groups.

Wait, so each H on the central C is attached to a carbon that has two CH3 groups. So, each H is next to another H on the adjacent carbon, which is also attached to two CH3 groups. So each H on the central C is coupled with the H on the adjacent C.

But wait, each H is on a C that has two CH3 groups. So each H is adjacent to the H on the next C, which is a CH group.

So, for example, the H on the second C (from the COOH) would be next to the H on the first C (from the COOH). So each H is coupled with one neighboring H. But then why the complex splitting?

Wait, perhaps each H is also coupled with the CH3 groups on the same C. Wait, but the CH3 groups are all equivalent in their own substituents. Or perhaps the coupling is between the H and the adjacent H, leading to a doublet. But that doesn't explain the more complex splitting.

Alternatively, let's think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH2COOH attached to a CH group, which is connected to a C with two C2H5 groups and another CH group with two C2H5 groups. So, the structure would be:

CH2COOH
|
CH(C2H5)
|
C(C2H5)CH(CH2COOH)

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: It's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central C's each have a CH group with two ethyl groups attached, and the chain is CH2COOH.

In this structure, the H on the CH groups (the ones attached to C2H5) would each be next to two ethyl groups and the adjacent CH group. So, each H on these CH groups would be adjacent to the H on the neighboring CH group. So coupling between these Hs would lead to a doublet. But there's more. Each H on the CH group is also next to the ethyl groups, but ethyl Hs are probably as a triplet in their own right, but that's not directly coupling with the CH Hs.

Wait, but in the NMR, the splitting is about the neighboring Hs that are coupled. So, the H on a CH group might be coupled with the H on the adjacent CH group, leading to a doublet. But why would it be a doublet of triplets of quartets?

Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me think about the possible splitting patterns and how they relate to the structure.

The signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So first, a doublet (two peaks), each of those split into triplets (three peaks each), and then each of those split into quartets (four peaks). Alternatively, perhaps the order is quartets first, then triplets, then doublets. But I'm not sure about the order; sometimes the splitting can be a combination of multiple couplings.

Alternatively, it's the result of coupling with three different sets of protons. Each set has a different coupling constant, leading to more splits. So, for example, if a proton is adjacent to three different groups, each with a different number of protons, that would create a complex pattern.

Wait, maybe the proton in question is on a bridgehead or a carbon where it's adjacent to multiple different types of protons.

Let me consider each option again.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

CH2COOH
|
CH(CH3)
|
CH(CH3)
|
CH3

Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the central CH's each have a CH3 and another CH(CH3). So perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the H's on the central CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and another CH(CH3). So each H on the central CH is adjacent to the H on the neighboring CH group. So each H on the central CH would be coupled with the H on the next carbon. That would give a doublet. But perhaps each is also coupled with other protons, like those on the CH3 groups.

Wait, but each H on the central CH is attached to a CH3. So the H on the central CH is adjacent to the three H's on the CH3 group. But wait, no, the coupling is through bonds. So, the H on CH would be adjacent to the H on the next CH, and perhaps the CH3 groups are further away, so their Hs don't directly cause splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to coupling with the adjacent CH group and another set of protons elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure in option C is such that the CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups. So each H on the CH is adjacent to the H on the neighboring CH group and maybe also to the CH3 groups.

Wait, but the CH3 groups are attached to the same C as the H, so their Hs are geminal (same C), so they don't cause splitting because geminal Hs don't split each other in NMR. That's because they're on the same C and don't have a J coupling (they're equivalent and split each other, but in practice, geminal protons are usually not observed as split because they're equivalent and cause a singlet).

So, perhaps the splitting comes from the neighboring H on the adjacent CH group. Each H would be coupled with the adjacent H, leading to a doublet. But that's not enough to explain the more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the H in question is on a CH2 group. For example, in option A and C, the COOH is attached to a CH2 group. So, the Hs on the CH2 would be split based on neighboring groups.

In option C, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the CH2 group is between the two CH groups and the COOH. The Hs on this CH2 would be next to the CH groups.

Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the Hs on the CH groups. So the CH2 Hs would each be next to two Hs (from the CH groups) because each CH group has one H.

Wait, no, the CH2 group is next to a CH group. Let me imagine the structure:

- The CH2 is between the two CH groups.

So, the CH2 group is attached to the two CH groups (each CH has one H) and the COOH.

So, the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the Hs on the CH group. Each CH group has one H, so each H on the CH2 would be next to one H on each adjacent CH group. Wait, but each CH2 H would have two adjacent Hs (from the two CH groups on either side), so the coupling constants could be similar or different.

Wait, each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 group (if it's a CH2 group), but in option C, the CH2 is a single CH2 between two CH groups. Wait, no, the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the CH2 is attached to the two CH groups (each CH has one H) and the COOH. So the CH2 group is like this:

-CH2-COOH

And each CH group is connected to a CH3 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is between two CH groups. So the Hs on the CH2 would be next to the Hs on the adjacent CH groups.

Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs (one on each side). That would lead to a triplet for each H on the CH2, but since the two adjacent Hs are on different Cs, perhaps the coupling constants are different, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is a single CH2, so each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2. But in that case, the splitting would be a triplet. But the question says that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting comes from coupling with multiple Hs on nearby groups. Let's think about the possible substituents.

In option C, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So, the CH2 is between two CH groups. Each CH group has a CH3 and another substituent (like the other CH group). So the CH2 group's Hs are next to the Hs on the CH groups. Each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (one on each CH). So each H on the CH2 would be splitting into a triplet due to coupling with two Hs (n+1=3). But if the two Hs have different coupling constants, it could lead to a more complex splitting. But the question mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the number of neighboring Hs each proton has.

A doublet of triplets of quartets implies that a proton is coupled with three different sets of Hs, each of which has a different coupling constant. Let me think of a scenario where a proton is adjacent to three different H environments.

For example, if a proton is on a carbon that is connected to three other carbons, each with their own sets of Hs. So, each set of Hs would cause a splitting.

Alternatively, the proton could be on a branch point, where it has three different Hs from three different adjacent groups.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option D is a possibility.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the structure is:

CH3CH2 connected to a C with H, CH3, and another C which is connected to H, CH3, and COOH.

So, the central C is attached to CH3CH2, a CH3, another C (which has H, CH3, and COOH), and the H on itself. So each H on the central C is adjacent to the H on the next C. So each H would couple with that H, leading to a doublet.

But perhaps each H on the central C is also adjacent to the CH3 groups. Wait, the CH3 groups are attached to the same C as the H, so they don't split.

Alternatively, the central C's H is next to the CH3 groups on adjacent Cs. Hmm, perhaps not.

Another approach: the 1H NMR shows several peaks, none from vinyl Hs. So it's a saturated compound. So the structures all have single bonds.

The complex splitting suggests branching and multiple adjacent Hs.

Wait, another thought: the Hs on the central C in option D would each be adjacent to the H on the next C. So each H would be a doublet. But what if each H is also coupled with another set of Hs, such as from the ethyl group (CH3CH2)?

In option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the ethyl group is on the first C, then the central C has H, CH3, and another C which has H, CH3, and COOH.

So the H on the central C is adjacent to the H on the next C. So each would be a doublet. But wait, the ethyl group's Hs are on a CH2, which is next to the central C. So the Hs on the ethyl CH2 might be adjacent to the central C's H, leading to more splitting.

Wait, the ethyl group is CH3CH2-, so the CH2 is adjacent to the central C, which has an H. So the Hs on the ethyl's CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the central C. So those Hs would be split into a triplet (if coupled with one H) or perhaps a doublet of triplets if coupled with more.

But in the NMR, the question mentions that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So perhaps the ethyl group's Hs are showing a particular splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is on the central Hs.

Wait, perhaps the central Hs in option D are each coupled with the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2.

So the H on the central C is adjacent to the CH2 group. The CH2 has two Hs. So the central H would couple with those two Hs. Each H on the CH2 would split the central H into a triplet (n+1 where n=2).

But then the central H's signal would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H on the central C would be a triplet. But the question says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the central H is coupled with the H on the adjacent C and also with the ethyl CH2 group's Hs.

So the central H would be coupled with two sets: the H on the adjacent C (leading to a doublet) and the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2 (leading to a triplet). So the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets, perhaps. But the question's signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is even more complex.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible structures again.

Option A: the structure is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the central CH groups each have a C2H5 (ethyl) group and a CH2COOH group. So the CH groups are each attached to an ethyl and a CH2COOH. So each H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the neighboring CH group and perhaps the Hs on the ethyl groups.

But the ethyl groups are CH2CH3, so each CH2 in the ethyl would have their own Hs. So perhaps the H on the CH is coupled with the H on the neighboring CH and with the Hs on the ethyl groups. But the ethyl groups are attached to the same C as the CH H, so their Hs are not adjacent. So the H on the CH would only be coupled with the H on the neighboring CH group, leading to a doublet. But again, this isn't matching the more complex splitting.

Wait, maybe the Hs on the ethyl groups are causing the splitting. For example, the Hs on the ethyl's CH2 are adjacent to the CH group. So each H on the CH is coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the CH H would be a triplet. But the question has a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Alternatively, the ethyl group's Hs are themselves showing a triplet, but that's not directly linked to the splitting pattern in question.

Hmm, maybe the correct structure is option A. Let me try to imagine the splitting in option A.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The central CH groups each have an ethyl group and a CH2COOH group. So the structure is:

COOH
|
CH2
|
C(H)(C2H5)
|
C(H)(C2H5)
|
CH3

Wait, that's not right. The formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the chain is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the central CH groups are each connected to an ethyl group and a CH2 group leading to the COOH. So, each H on the central CH is adjacent to the H on the neighboring CH group.

So each H on the CH would be a doublet due to coupling with the neighboring H. But why the more complex splitting?

Alternatively, perhaps each H on the CH is adjacent to the ethyl group's Hs. The ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2 group is attached to the central CH. So the Hs on the ethyl's CH2 are adjacent to the CH group's H. So each H on the CH is coupled with the two Hs on the ethyl's CH2, leading to a triplet. Also, the H on the CH is coupled with the H on the neighboring CH group, leading to a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet (from ethyl CH2) and a doublet (from neighboring CH), resulting in a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets. Wait, no, the order of splitting can affect the pattern, but the number of peaks would be 2 * 3 = 6. But the NMR signal described is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is 2 *3 *4 =24 peaks. That's a lot, but maybe not impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps each H on the CH is coupled with three different sets of Hs: the ethyl CH2, the neighboring CH H, and another group. But that might complicate things further.

Another approach: the presence of a doublet of triplets of triplets suggests another proton's environment. Let's think about the other signals in the NMR. Each option has different branching, so the splitting would vary.

Wait, let's think about the number of nonequivalent protons in each structure. For example, in option D, the ethyl group is at the end, so the CH3CH2 group would have a triplet for the CH2 Hs (coupled with the CH3), and the CH3 would be a quartet (coupled with the CH2). But if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, their Hs would split the CH2's signal further.

Wait, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the CH3CH2 group is attached to a CH group, which has a CH3 and another CH group with a COOH. So, the CH2 in CH3CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the CH group. So the CH2 Hs would be split by the CH H's. The CH2 has two Hs, so each would be split into a triplet (if coupled with one H) or perhaps a quartet (if coupled with two Hs? No, because each H is coupled with one H on the CH group.

Wait, each H on the CH2 (from CH3CH2-) is adjacent to the H on the CH group. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, because they're coupled with one H. But the CH2 group itself has two Hs, so their splitting would be a quartet (n+1 where n=3 from CH3) and then each H coupled with the CH H, making it a doublet. So the CH2's Hs would be a quartet of doublets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the CH2 group is split into a quartet due to the CH3, and then each line is split into a doublet due to the CH H. So the overall splitting would be a doublet of quartets, which is 8 peaks. But the question mentions a quartet in a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2's Hs are split into a quartet (from the CH3) and a doublet (from the CH H), leading to
