Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about some fluorine compounds, and I need to figure out the molecular weight range of substance A4. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The question says there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F. I'm trying to think of elements that have multiple fluorides. Maybe something like sulfur, which can form SF6, but wait—S has multiple fluorides. Or maybe chlorine? No, chlorine usually forms only a few. Alternatively, maybe it's something like phosphorus, which forms PF3, PF5, etc. Or perhaps it's another element like iodine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen? No, O doesn't form five binary fluorides. Hmm.

Wait, the question says five binary compounds. Let me think. Sulfur has several fluorides: SF4, SF6, etc. Wait, but how many? Let me think: SF2, SF4, SF6—only three. Maybe another element. Oh, maybe chlorine? No, wait, ClF3, ClF5? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's iodine. I don't remember. Alternatively, maybe Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus can form PF3, PF5, and maybe others. But that's three, not five. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen? Wait, no, oxygen has OF2, but that's it. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track here.

Wait, let's look at the other parts of the question for clues. The first part says that substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. The oF of A2 is 31.96%. Oh wait, oF probably stands for oxygen-free, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's the oxidation state of fluorine. Wait, 31.96%... that's approximately the percentage of fluorine in something. Let me calculate: fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19. So if a compound has 31.96% F, maybe it's F2? No, wait, F2 is elemental fluorine. Or maybe a compound.

Wait, if A2 has a F content of 31.96%. Let me compute the molecular weight. Suppose the compound is XY, so X is Y. Let's say the formula is YF. The percentage of F would be (19 / (atomic weight of Y + 19)) * 100 = 31.96%. Let me assume Y is another element. So 19 / (Y +19) = 0.3196. Solving for Y: 19 = 0.3196(Y +19) → 19 / 0.3196 ≈ Y +19 → approx 59.48 ≈ Y +19 → Y≈40.48. So Y would be around 40.48. Looking at the periodic table, what's around 40? Titanium is 47.9, but maybe not. Wait, 40 is close to Zr (91), no. Wait, maybe I did the math wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as YF3 or something else. Let's see. Let's assume the formula is YF3. Then the molecular weight would be Y + 3*19 = Y+57. The percentage of F would be (57 / (Y+57)) * 100 = 31.96%. So 57/(Y+57) = 0.3196 → 57 / 0.3196 ≈ Y +57 → 57 /0.3196 ≈ 178.3 → Y ≈ 178.3 -57 = 121.3. That would make Y's atomic weight around 121. Hmm, but what element is around 121? Let me think. I know that tin is around 118.71, and then tellurium is 127.6. So 121 is close to tin. Could Y be tin (Sn)? So Y would be Sn?

Wait, but Sn forms multiple fluorides. Let me think. SnF2, SnF4, maybe others. Hmm, but five binary compounds... I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Wait, let me think again. Maybe the formula is YF2. Then the percentage is (38/(Y+38))*100=31.96. So 38/(Y+38)=0.3196 → Y+38 = 38/0.3196 ≈ 118.8 → Y≈80.8. That would be around lead (Pb, atomic weight ~207.2), but wait, 80 is closer to strontium (Sr: ~87.62) or maybe something else. Hmm, this approach might not be the best. Let me think of other clues.

A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. And A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is noble gas, and being oxidized would imply that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a fluoride that's a strong oxidizer. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizer, but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's F2O or something else? Wait, perhaps A1 is a compound that upon decomposition releases F2. So A1 might be something like YF4, which when heated decomposes into YF2 and F2. Or maybe YF6 decomposes into YF3 and F2. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition. Suppose A1→A2 + F2. So maybe A1 is a di-fluoride. For example, if A1 is YF4 and A2 is YF2, but then the F percentage would be different. Alternatively, if A1 is YF6, then decomposition could produce YF2 and F2? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the part about A1 oxidizing xenon. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent and can oxidize noble gases under certain conditions. So if A1 is a fluoride with high oxidation state of Y, perhaps Y is in a higher oxidation state, making A1 a strong oxidizer. For example, if Y is in +6 oxidation state, like in YF6^3- (if Y is a group 6 element). Wait, but group 6 elements like sulfur form SF6, which is a gas, and is a strong oxidizer.

Wait, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a known compound. It's a gas, colorless, but the question says A1 is bright red. Hmm, maybe not sulfur. Alternatively, perhaps it's another element.

Wait, what about chlorine trifluoride (ClF3)? It's a strong oxidizer. But I'm not sure about the red color. Alternatively, maybe it's lead fluoride? But lead's fluorides are different.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine. But five binary fluorides? Chlorine can form ClF3, ClF5, maybe ClF? Hmm, that's three. Not five. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus forms PF3, PF5, and maybe others. But again, only three. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen, but that doesn't make sense because oxygen doesn't form that many fluorides. Wait, maybe Y is another element, like nitrogen? No, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the fluorides are in varying oxidation states. Let me think, if Y has multiple oxidation states, it can form multiple fluorides. For example, tin (Sn) can have +2 and +4 oxidation states, so maybe SnF2, SnF4, etc. But that might only account for a few, not five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine. Iodine can form IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. That's four, but maybe another? Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is carbon. Carbon can form CF4, but that's only one. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal such as aluminum. Aluminum forms AlF3, but that's it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is sulfur, which forms SF2, SF4, SF6, and others, but I'm not sure if that's five. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the decomposition reaction. A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So A1 → A2 + F2. Let's think about possible reactions. For example, if A1 is ClF3, it could decompose into ClF and F2. But I'm not sure what the products would be. Alternatively, if A1 is something like YF3, maybe it decomposes into Y and F2. But YF3 → Y + 3/2 F2. Wait, that would produce F2 and Y.

But in the question, A1 oxidizes xenon. So A1 is a strong oxidizer. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. So perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state. For example, if Y is sulfur, then SF6 has S in +6. Or perhaps Y is Cl in ClF3, which is Cl in +3. Hmm.

Wait, another clue: when you add Y in 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, you get A5, which decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride, and adding Y gives another fluoride. Let me think, if A4 is something like YF5, and adding Y gives YF3 or something else. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a different compound, like a hydrofluoric acid derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3, and adding Y metal would produce another compound. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a transition metal. Let me think of tin. Sn forms SnF2 and SnF4. But does that make five fluorides? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is lead. Lead forms PbF2, PbF4, maybe others. But again, not five.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a group 14 element, like silicon? No, silicon forms SiF4, I think. Hmm.

Wait, the part about A3 being obtained by fluorination of Y. So A3 is a fluoride of Y. So perhaps A3 is YF2 or YF. Then, A3 interacts with xenon. Maybe in some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: I remember that ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. So if A1 is ClF3, which is a brownish-yellow liquid, but the question says bright-red. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe A1 is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen. But I don't think oxygen has five fluorides. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is easier if I think about the decomposition of A1. If A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine gas, then the fluorine is being released. So A1 is a fluoride where fluorine is in a lower oxidation state than in F2. Wait, but fluorine is already in the highest oxidation state in F2. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a polyatomic fluoride that releases F2 upon decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a mixture, but no, it's a compound. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the part about the fluorine content in A2. A2 has 31.96% fluorine. So (mass of F) / (mass of compound) = 0.3196. Let's say the formula is YF. Then, (19)/(Y +19) = 0.3196 → Y +19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 59.48 → Y ≈ 40.48. So Y would be approximately 40.5. Which element has an atomic weight around 40? Titanium is about 47.87. Close but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the formula is YF2. Then (38)/(Y+38)=0.3196 → Y+38=38/0.3196≈118.8 → Y≈80.8. Which element is around 80.8? Maybe strontium is about 87.94, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe the formula is YF3. Then (57)/(Y+57)=0.3196 → Y+57=57/0.3196≈178.3 → Y≈121.3. That's close to tellurium (127.6), but not exact. Alternatively, maybe Y is tin (Sn) with a molecular weight around 118.71. Wait, 118.71 is close to 120; so if I plug Y =118.71 into YF2: 38/(118.71 +38)=38/156.71≈0.2423 or 24.23%, which is not 31.96%. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the formula isn't YF, YF2, or YF3. What about YF4? So (76)/(Y+76)=0.3196 → Y+76=76/0.3196≈237.3 → Y≈161.3. Hmm, 161 is close to Erbium (Er) which is around 167. So no. Alternatively, YF5: (95)/(Y+95) = 0.3196 → Y+95=95/0.3196≈297.3 → Y≈202.3. That's close to lead (207.2). Hmm. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe my approach is wrong. Maybe the formula is YF5, but that's getting higher. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is YF2O or something else, but the question says binary compounds, so it's only Y and F.

Wait, another angle: when A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. Maybe A5 is a salt that hydrolyzes. For example, if A5 is NaF, but that's a simple salt. Alternatively, maybe it's something more complex.

Wait, the part about adding Y to A4. The problem says: adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. So perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3. When you add Y metal to YF3 solution, perhaps a redox reaction occurs. For example, Y metal might reduce YF3 to a lower fluoride, like YF. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5. Adding Y might produce YF3 and release HF or something, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: when you add a metal to a solution of its higher fluoride, you might get a lower fluoride. For example, adding Y to YF5 solution might produce YF3 and some other products. Or perhaps it's a precipitation reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y gives YF2. So YF4 + Y → YF2. The reaction would be YF4 + Y → 2 YF2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of YF6, which upon adding Y would produce YF4 and F2? Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the molecular weights. The question asks for the range of A4's molecular weight. The options are A) 140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

So let's try to find what A4 could be. If A4 is a fluoride of Y, perhaps it's YF3, YF4, etc. Let's see, if Y is around 120 (like tin, but earlier calculation suggested Y~121), then YF3 would have a molecular weight of 120 + 3*19 = 120 +57=177, which is in the 160-180 range (option C). Alternatively, if Y is around 80 (like strontium), then YF2 would be 80 + 38=118, which is option D (110-130). Hmm.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated YF2, I got Y≈80.8. If Y is around 80, then YF2 would have a molecular weight of 80 +38=118, which falls into option D (110-130). So if A4 is YF2, then its molecular weight is about 118, which is in option D.

But wait, earlier I thought A2 is YF, but maybe A2 is YF2. Let me retrace.

In the decomposition: A1 → A2 + F2. So if A1 is YF4, perhaps it decomposes into YF2 and F2. Let's check the fluorine percentage in A2 (YF2). So the F percentage is (2*19)/(Y + 38) *100 = 31.96%. So (38)/(Y+38) = 0.3196 → Y+38=38/0.3196≈118.8 → Y≈80.8. So Y is around 80.8, which is close to strontium (Sr, atomic weight ~87.62). Wait, but 80 is close to yttrium (Y, ~88.91). Wait, maybe it's not a metal. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fluorides of tin. Tin can form SnF2 and SnF4. But I'm not sure about the fluorine percentages.

Wait, if Y is around 80, then YF2 would have a mol weight of 118, which is in option D. But earlier, the addition of Y to A4 produces A5. If A4 is a solution of YF2, adding Y would produce what? Maybe YF, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is YF3. If Y is 80, then YF3 would be 80 +57=137, which is in option A (140-160). Close, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps Y is not 80. Let me think again. The F percentage in A2 is 31.96%. So if A2 is YF2, then 38/(Y+38)=0.3196 → Y≈80.8. So Y is approximately 80.8. What's the element with atomic weight around 80? Strontium is about 87.94, which is a bit higher. Yttrium is around 88.91. Maybe it's not a metal. Alternatively, perhaps it's a non-metal. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe Y is a transition metal. Let's think about molybdenum (Mo, ~95.95), but that's higher than 80. Alternatively, maybe it's zinc (Zn, ~65.38). Hmm, 65 is lower than 80. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the possible options. The options for A4's molecular weight are A) 140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

If A4 is YF4, for Y≈80, then YF4 would be 80 +4*19=80+76=156. That's in option A (140-160). Alternatively, if Y is higher, say 120, then YF4 is 120+76=196, which is option C.

But earlier calculation for A2 being YF2 gives Y≈80.8, leading to YF4 being 156, which is option A.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to think of the other parts.

A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So A3 is YF, YF2, etc. A3 interacts with xenon. So perhaps A3 is a fluoride that can react with xenon under certain conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so perhaps it's inert, but some fluorides can react. For example, ClF3 can react with Xe under certain conditions. Hmm.

Wait, the question also says that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is a strong oxidiser. Which binary fluorides are strong oxidizers? ClF3 is a strong oxidizer, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, F2 is a strong oxidizer, but it's elemental.

Wait, perhaps I should think that Y is chlorine. Chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) is a strong oxidizing agent. It's a brownish-yellow liquid. But the question says A1 is bright red. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about Oxo-fluorides, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is tin. Tin forms SnF2 and SnF4, which are white solids. Hmm, but I'm not sure about their properties.

Alternatively, maybe Y is lead. Lead forms PbF2 and PbF4. PbF2 is white, PbF4 is also white. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible fluorides and their properties.

- A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 (31.96% F) and F2.

- A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So it's a strong oxidizer.

- A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y, so A3 is a fluoride of Y. A3 can interact with xenon.

- Adding Y to A4 (hot, colorless, concentrated) gives A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.

So perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3. When Y is added, it might form YF or YF2. For example, YF3 + Y → 2 YF2. So YF3 would have a molecular weight of Y + 57.

If Y is 80, YF3 is 137, which is option A (140-160, close). Alternatively, if Y is 120, YF3 is 177, which is option C (160-180).

Hmm.

Wait, when you add Y metal to YF3 solution, what happens? Let's think of the reaction: YF3 + Y → 2 YF2. So the reaction is a reduction. Y in YF3 is in +3 oxidation state, and in YF2 it's +2. So Y is getting reduced, which means it's acting as an oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps YF3 is being converted to YF, which would be more reduced.

Alternatively, maybe YF4 is formed. Hmm.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to connect the dots.

If A4 is YF3, and when Y is added, it forms YF2. So A5 would be YF2, which upon decomposition in water gives two substances. YF2 + H2O → Y(OH)2 + 2 HF. That makes sense.

So the decomposition of A5 (YF2) in water gives Y(OH)2 and HF.

So, if YF2 is A5, then A4 would be YF3. So YF3's molecular weight would be Y +57. If Y is 80, YF3 is 137 (option A). If Y is 120, it's 177 (option C).

Earlier, from the decomposition of A1 into A2 (YF2) and F2, Y is about 80. So YF3 would be 137, which is in option A (140-160). Hmm.

But earlier when I calculated Y as 80.8 from A2 being YF2, that leads to YF3 being 80.8 + 57 = 137.8, which is about 138. So that's in option A (140-160). But wait, the options are ranges, so 138 is just below 140. So maybe option A is 140-160, so 138 doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe A2 isn't YF2 but another compound. Let me think again.

If A2 has 31.96% F, and it's a binary compound of Y and F, let's compute for YF:

(19)/(Y+19) = 0.3196 → Y +19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 59.48 → Y≈40.48. So Y would be around 40, which is titanium (47.87). Close but not exact.

If Y is titanium, then YF would have a molecular weight of about 40 +19=59. But that's way below the given options. So maybe YF isn't the right formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A
