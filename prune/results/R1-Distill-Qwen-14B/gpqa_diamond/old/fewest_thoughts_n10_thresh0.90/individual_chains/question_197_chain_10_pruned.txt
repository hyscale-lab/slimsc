Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a hydrolysis or something else. Wait, sometimes red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of esters or maybe in the substitution of certain groups.

First, I should analyze the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is. Let's start with the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region—maybe O-H or N-H stretching, but since there's a peak around 1720 cm-1, that might be a carbonyl group like a ketone or ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are probably aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester, and some substituents.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H). That's pretty downfield. A broad peak could indicate an -OH group, but at 10.5, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or could it be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid? But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is present here. So the peak at 10.5 could be a carboxylic acid proton. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, but then the IR doesn't show a strong peak for C=O in aldehydes, which is usually around 1720 as well, but maybe with other features. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but it can vary. Alternatively, esters have carbonyls around 1730-1750, and ketones around 1715. So 1720 seems to fit for either. The presence of a broad peak at 10.5 suggests maybe a carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. The doublets indicate coupling between adjacent protons. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, like two substituents opposite each other. For example, a substituent on the benzene ring that's an electron-withdrawing group, maybe a carbonyl group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR signals: 8.0 ppm is higher, which would be deshielded protons. So if it's a benzoic acid, the ring protons would be downfield. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, like acetophenone, but then the substituent is a ketone, which is also para. But in the NMR, the aromatic signals are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So the molecule is symmetric in that region. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two identical groups. Wait, no—if it's a single substituent in the para position, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets. Oh wait, no. If it's a single substituent in the para position, the ring would have two protons on one side and two on the other. Wait, actually, for a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is in one position, so the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 are equivalent. So each would be a doublet because they are adjacent to substituents. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that's causing the ring to have coupling. For example, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a phenyl ketone or a benzoic acid, then the ring protons would be split into doublets. Wait, but the substituent at para would cause the ring protons to be ortho and meta to it. So the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield, and the meta would be more upfield. So the NMR shows 8.0 ppm for two Hs and 7.2 for another two. That seems consistent with a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

So putting that together, perhaps the structure is something like para-substituted phenyl with a carbonyl group. Let me think about the other NMR signals. There's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. Like in an ethyl group, where the CH2CH3 would have a triplet. The 1.4 ppm doublet of 3H suggests a methyl attached to something else, maybe a CH or adjacent to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm m (2H) could be two protons from a CH2 group. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH group connected to other groups.

So perhaps the structure has an ethyl or isobutyl group attached. Let's think about this. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. For example, in an isobutyl group: CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Isobutyl would have a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3)2. The protons on the CH2
