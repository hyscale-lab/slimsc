Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to form complexes. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA. The formation constant, Kf, is given as 5e10. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, and Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, we're dealing with a solution that already has the Ca-EDTA complex at a concentration of 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the solution is at equilibrium, we can model the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but I'm confused. If the complex is 0.02 M, then in solution, it would dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to the Kf. But wait, Kf is very large here (5e10), which suggests that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation of the complex would be very little. Which means that the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Let me write the equation again. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2-. So when it dissociates, it goes into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-:

[CaEDTA]^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10, so the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/(5e10). Because Kd = 1/Kf. Yeah, because Kd is the reverse reaction.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we assume that x amount dissociates. So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so big, x should be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can approximate.

So the expression for Kd is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = x^2 / 0.02. And Kd is 1/(5e10) which is 2e-11.

Setting up the equation:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so square root is 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 squared, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. Because 6.5 * 2 is 13. So yes.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, because 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7, so square root of 1e-13 is 3.16e-7.

So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the concentration of calcium ions. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because Kf is 5e10, that's a very high value, meaning the complex is very stable. So only a tiny amount dissociates, which means [Ca²+] is very low, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) and EDTA⁴⁻ ions ([EDTA⁴⁻]) that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \quad \text{(since \( x \) is very small)}
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Solve for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Take the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} = 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
