Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, let me think. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Oh wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. I need to break this down.

Wait, what's the enthalpy of formation again? Oh right, it's the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I guess I need to figure out how many bonds are broken and formed when this compound is made.

The question gives me some bond energies. Let me jot those down. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, I'm not sure if I need that. Oh wait, atomization is breaking all bonds to form atoms, so maybe that's for when the elements are in their atomic form, but I'm not entirely sure how that factors into this.

The bond energies given:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but wait, the molecule given is all carbon and hydrogen, right? So I'll need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule and then compute the enthalpy change.

First, let me figure out the structure of the molecule. The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me see: Each (CH3)2C= part is a substituent attached to a CH group. So maybe it's a diene or something with multiple double bonds?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each type of bond by looking at the structure.

Let me try to sketch it out mentally.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, so perhaps it's structured as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each end has a (CH3)2C=C group. Wait, no, because the other end has CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, perhaps the structure is a conjugated diene or something with multiple double bonds.

But maybe I can approach this differently. To calculate the enthalpy of formation, I can use the formula:

ΔHf° = Σ [Bond energies of products] - Σ [Bond energies of reactants]

But wait, no, in this case, the reactants would be the elements in their standard states (like H2 and C), and the product is our compound. Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the product.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔHf = sum (bonds broken) - sum (bonds formed)

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of a molecule is equal to the sum of the energies of the bonds in the molecule minus the sum of the energies of the bonds in the elements (which are broken to form the molecule). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of all bonds in the molecule)] - [Σ (Bond energies from the elements)]

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Or maybe I should think of it in terms of the molecule being formed from its constituent atoms. So, the atoms are in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite and for hydrogen is H2 gas.

So, to form the molecule, we need to break the bonds in the elements and form the bonds in the molecule.

So, the general approach would be:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of elements) ] - [Σ (Bond energies in the molecule)]

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, to calculate this, I need to consider the bonds that are broken in the reactants (elements) and the bonds that are formed in the products (the compound).

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bonds broken in reactants)] - [Σ (Bonds formed in products)]

Wait, actually, no. Because when you form a molecule, you're breaking bonds in the elements and forming bonds in the molecule. So the enthalpy change is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

Wait, no, wait. Because breaking bonds releases energy, and forming bonds requires energy. So when you form a molecule, you have to break the bonds in the elements (which requires energy) and form the bonds in the product (which releases energy). So the overall enthalpy change is (sum of bond energies of the elements) minus (sum of bond energies of the product bonds).

Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

ΔHf° = [sum (bonds broken in elements) ] - [sum (bonds formed in molecule) ]

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering all the bonds in the molecule, and how they relate to the bonds in the elements.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Atoms × bond energies of elements)] - [Σ (Bonds in molecule) × bond energies]

Wait, maybe more precisely, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms × C atomization energy) + (number of H atoms × H atomization energy) ] - [sum of all bond energies in the molecule]

Wait, but the problem gives me the bond energies, not the atomization energies. Oh, but the atomization energy of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, atomization energy is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to form its atoms. For example, for carbon in graphite, which is a solid, the atomization energy is the energy required to break all the C-C bonds into C atoms.

Wait, but in the problem, the given is the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So, for each mole of carbon, it's 1000 kJ to break all bonds into atoms.

So, when forming the molecule, we start with graphite (C) and H2 gas. So, to form the molecule, we have to break the C-C bonds in graphite and the H-H bonds in H2, then form the bonds in the molecule.

So, the steps would be:

1. Calculate the number of C and H atoms in the molecule.

2. Calculate the bonds broken in the elements: for C, that's the C-C bonds in graphite. But how many C-C bonds are there per mole of C? Hmm, wait, the atomization energy is given per mole of C. So, for each mole of C, you have to break a certain number of C-C bonds. Graphite has a structure where each C is bonded to three others, but in the atomization energy, perhaps it's considered as each C has four bonds? Wait, no, no, maybe each C in graphite has three C-C bonds, but the exact number depends on the structure.

Wait, but perhaps this is more complicated than I can handle right now. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to use the formula for enthalpy of formation based on bond energies:

ΔHf° = [Σ (number of bonds × bond energy in the molecule)] - [Σ (number of bonds × bond energy in the elements)]

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken from elements)] - [Σ (bonds formed in the molecule)]

Wait, but bonds broken in elements would be the bonds in graphite and H2. So, for each C in the molecule, how many C-C bonds are being broken in graphite? And for each H, how many H-H bonds are broken in H2.

Wait, perhaps for each C atom used, the number of C-C bonds broken is 0.25 per C. Because in graphite, each C is connected to three others, but the structure is in a hexagonal lattice, so each bond is shared between two C atoms. So, per mole of C, the number of C-C bonds is 3/2 per C atom. So for one mole of C (6.022e23 atoms), the number of C-C bonds is (6.022e23 atoms) × (3/2) bonds per atom. But wait, the bond energy is given per mole, so perhaps we can find how many C-C bonds are broken per mole of C.

Wait, the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol for C. So each mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ to break all the bonds. So, the number of C-C bonds per mole of C is the same as the number of bonds that are broken when producing a mole of C atoms, which is 1000 kJ per mole.

Wait, but the bond energy for C-C is 200 kJ/mol. So, if each mole of C requires 1000 kJ to atomize, and each C-C bond contributes 200 kJ, then the number of C-C bonds per mole of C is 1000 / 200 = 5 moles of C-C bonds per mole of C atoms. Wait, but that can't be right because a mole of C atoms would have a certain number of C-C bonds in the solid.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Let me first count all the bonds in the molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each type of bond.

First, let's count the C-C bonds and C=C bonds.

Looking at the structure:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH: there's a C=C double bond between the (CH3)2C and CH.

- Then comes -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

- Then another CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the molecule has two C=C double bonds, perhaps? Or wait, perhaps it's more than that. Let me count.

Wait, let's break it down:

Each (CH3)2C= is a group attached via a double bond. So the structure has two double bonds: one between each (CH3)2C and the adjacent CH group. But wait, no, perhaps each end has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but in the question, it's written as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So, the double bonds are at positions (CH3)2C=CH and CH=C(CH3)2. So, two double bonds in the molecule, each being a C=C.

So, each double bond is 1 mole of C=C bonds. So, total C=C bonds: 2.

Now, the rest are single C-C bonds. Let's see.

Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds. Let's count all the C-H bonds. Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds, and there are two CH3 groups per substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the C-H bonds.

Let me look at each part.

(CH3)2C=CH: Each CH3 has 3 C-H, so 2×3=6 C-H bonds. The C=CH has a single C-H bond (the CH part), so that's 1 C-H. So, total in this part: 7 C-H bonds.

Then, the -CH2- has two C-H bonds per CH2 group. Wait, no, the CH2 groups in the middle have two C-H each?

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each part's C-H bonds.

Looking again:

(CH3)2C=CH: each CH3 has 3 C-H, so 2×3 =6, plus the CH has 1 C-H. So 7.

Then, the next part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: Each CH2 has 2 C-H. So, each CH2 has 2 H's, so 2 C-H bonds each. So, the first CH2 after the double bond has 2 C-H. Then, the CH(CH3) has 1 C-H (since CH3 has 3, but the CH has one more H attached). Wait, no, the structure is CH(CH3), so the central carbon is connected to CH3, another CH2, and the next group. So, the CH(CH3) has only one C-H bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me write out all the groups and count each C-H bond.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: the central C is connected to two CH3 groups and the double bond. So each CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds, so 2×3=6. The CH part has 1 C-H bond. So that's 7.

Then the next group is CH2-: which is connected to the CH(CH3). So that CH2 has 2 C-H bonds (each H is a single bond).

Then, the CH(CH3): the central C is connected to two CH2 groups (I think). Wait, no, looking at the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So after the first double bond, it's CH connected to CH2, then CH2 connected to CH(CH3), then CH2 connected to another CH group which is part of another double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider each carbon and count the H's attached.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count all the C-H bonds in the molecule.

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds.

Let me count how many CH3 groups are present.

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 2 CH3 groups.

- CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2: the CH(CH3) has one CH3 group.

- CH=C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups.

So, total CH3 groups: 2 + 1 + 2 =5.

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds, so 5×3=15 C-H bonds.

Wait, but wait, the CH(CH3) group has one CH3 attached, so that's another CH3 group.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each end has a (CH3)2C= group, and in the middle, there's a CH(CH3) group.

So, let's count the CH3 groups.

- Two from the first (CH3)2C= part.

- One from CH(CH3).

- Two from the last (CH3)2C part.

So, total 5 CH3 groups, each with 3 C-H bonds: 5×3=15.

Additionally, each CH2 group has two C-H bonds. Let's count the number of CH2 groups.

Looking at the structure:

Between each part, there are CH2 groups.

- After the first double bond: CH2-.

- Then another CH2-.

- Then another CH2 before the second double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 groups are:

After the first double bond: CH2- (then another CH2- before the CH(CH3), and another CH2- before the next double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has three CH2 groups.

Each CH2 contributes 2 C-H bonds. So, 3×2=6.

Then, the CH groups that are not in CH3 have one C-H bond each.

Looking for all CH groups:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH: the CH has one C-H.

- The last part: CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has one C-H.

Plus, perhaps any other CH groups in the middle.

Looking at the middle: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

The CH(CH3) has one C-H (since it's attached to one H and three CH3 groups? No, wait, CH(CH3) would have one H: like CH2CH(CH3)CH2...

Wait, perhaps the middle part is:

- CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

The CH(CH3) has one C-H bond.

So, the CH groups in the middle are the ones in CH(CH3) and perhaps any others.

Wait, so let's count:

- First (CH3)2C=CH: 1 CH.

- Middle: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2: the CH(CH3) is one CH, and perhaps the CH2 groups don't have any CH groups beyond their own.

Wait, total CH groups (each with one C-H bond):

1 (from first CH) + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 (from last CH) = 3.

So, each has one C-H bond: 3×1=3.

So, total C-H bonds: 15 (from CH3) +6 (from CH2) +3 (from CH) =24.

So, 24 C-H bonds.

Now, C-C bonds: let's count.

Each single bond between carbons is a C-C bond.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The double bonds are two C=C bonds.

So, the rest are single C-C bonds.

Let me count the total number of C atoms.

Each (CH3)2C= unit has 3 C atoms (two CH3 and one central C). But wait, each (CH3)2C= is a propene-like group. So, in the molecule, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the C's:

1. (CH3)2C= (3 C: two CH3 and one C with double bond)
2. CH (1 C)
3. CH2 (1 C)
4. CH(CH3) (1 C)
5. CH2 (1 C)
6. CH=C(CH3)2 (3 C: one C in CH, one in C=C, and two in the CH3 groups)

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 8 C atoms.

Wait, let me count:

Each (CH3)2C= has 3 C (two CH3 and one central C). Then, the CH after that is another C. Then, each CH2 is another C. So, perhaps:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C from (CH3)2C= plus 1 C in CH → 4 C.

- Then, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: each CH2 is a C, CH(CH3) is a C → 3 C.

- Then, -CH=C(CH3)2: 3 C (CH, C=C, and the C in CH3).

Wait, but perhaps the entire molecule is longer. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula.

The formula of the molecule: Let's see, each (CH3)2C=CH has (CH3)2-C=CH. So, the formula for each such group is C4H6? Because (CH3)2C=CH is (2*(CH3)) + C=CH → 2*(3H) + (1C=CH) which has 3 H (since CH is H). Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule's formula is C14H22.

Wait, let me count the H's and C's.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: (CH3)2 has 2*3=6 H, the C=CH has 2 H (since CH has one H). Wait, no, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH. So, the C is double-bonded to CH, which has one H. So, each (CH3)2C=CH has 6 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH) =7 H.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to count each part:

Each (CH3)2C=CH has:

- 2 CH3 groups → 2×3=6 H.

- The central C is bonded to two CH3 and one double bond (C=CH), so the CH has one H.

So, that's 6 + 1 =7 H in that group.

Then, the structure after that is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Each CH2 has 2 H, and the CH(CH3) has 1 H.

So, CH2: 2 H, CH(CH3):1 H, CH2: 2 H → total 5 H.

Then, the last part: CH=C(CH3)2.

CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H, but wait, the structure is CH=C(CH3)2. So, the C=C has two CH3 groups attached. So, the CH has 1 H, and the two CH3 groups contribute 3×2=6 H.

So, that part has 1 +6 =7 H.

Adding all together:

First group:7 H.

Second group:5 H.

Third group:7 H.

Total H:7+5+7=19 H? But wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I should count each H in the entire structure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula of the molecule. Let me count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group is part of the molecule. Let's see:

Each (CH3)2C=CH has:

2*(CH3) = 2*3=6 H.

Plus the CH group: 1 H.

So, 7 H in that part.

Each CH2 has 2 H, CH(CH3) has 1 H.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too messy; maybe I should think in terms of the molecular formula.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each (CH3)2C=CH- group: (CH3)2C=CH has the formula C4H6.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH: formula is (CH3)2CH-CH2? No, wait, (CH3)2C=CH is (CH2CH3)C=CH?

Wait, perhaps the formula is C4H6.

Then, the middle part: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: that's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, which is C5H10.

Wait, no, perhaps each CH2 is CH2 group, etc.

Wait, perhaps the entire formula is:

Each end is (CH3)2C=CH (C4H6) and the middle is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 (C4H8).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Alternatively, perhaps I should count all the H's and C's.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of C atoms.

The molecule has:

In each (CH3)2 group: 2 C per CH3, but wait, each CH3 is attached to a central C. So, for each (CH3)2C= part, there are 3 C atoms (two from CH3 and one central C).

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 8 C atoms in total. Let me see:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C.

- Then CH2: 1 C.

- CH(CH3): 1 C.

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 3 C.

Total: 3 +1 +1 +1 +3 =9 C atoms.

Wait, maybe I'm missing some. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C10H16 or something else.

But perhaps it's not necessary to get the exact formula for the C and H counts. Let's get back to the bonds.

So, the molecule has 24 C-H bonds.

Now, the C-C bonds.

Each time two C atoms are connected by a single bond, that's a C-C bond.

Let me count the number of single C-C bonds.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the single bonds:

- Between the (CH3)2C= and the CH: that's a single bond (since it's a double bond to the CH, but the C is connected to the next C via a single bond? No, wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the = sign is between the (CH3)2C and the CH.

So, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH  - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the single bonds are:

1. Between the (CH3)2C=CH and the next CH2: that's a single C-C bond.

2. Between the CH2 and the next CH(CH3): single bond.

3. Between CH(CH3) and the next CH2: single bond.

4. Between the CH2 and the CH=C...: single bond.

So, that's four single C-C bonds.

Wait, but that seems too few. Alternatively, perhaps each part contributes more.

Wait, perhaps each CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- contributes two single C-C bonds.

Wait, let me think again.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH (single bond to CH2) → CH2 (single bond to CH(CH3)) → CH(CH3) (single bond to CH2) → CH2 (single bond to CH).

And the CH is connected via a double bond to C(CH3)2.

So, the single C-C bonds are:

1. Between the (CH3)2C and the CH.

Wait, no, the (CH3)2C is double-bonded to CH.

Wait, so the (CH3)2C=CH has a double bond between C and CH, so the next bond is a single bond between the CH and the CH2.

That's one single C-C bond.

Then, between CH2 and CH(CH3): another single C-C bond.

Between CH(CH3) and CH2: another single.

Between CH2 and CH: another single.

So that's four single C-C bonds.

Plus, the C=C bonds: two of them.

Wait, but wait, each C=C is a single unit, so each C=C counts as one bond.

So, the molecule has 4 single C-C bonds and 2 double C=C bonds.

Wait, but wait, the (CH3)2C= CH part is a double bond, so that's one C=C. Then, the CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 has another C=C. So two in total.

So, total C-C bonds: 4 single bonds + 2 double bonds? No, wait, each double bond is one bond, but they're double. Wait no, each double bond is one bond with two bonds.

Wait, no, in terms of counting bonds, a double bond is one bond but worth two in terms of bond energy. So, each C=C bond contributes 300 kJ/mol, whereas a single C-C contributes 200 kJ/mol.

So, in terms of counting bonds for the sum:

Each C-C single bond is 200 kJ/mol.

Each C=C double bond is 300 kJ/mol.

So, for the molecule, 4 single C-C bonds: 4 × 200 = 800 kJ.

Plus 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 = 600 kJ.

Plus the C-H bonds: 24 × 400 = 9600 kJ.

So, total bond energy in the molecule is 800 +600 +9600 = 11000 kJ/mol.

Now, the bonds broken in the elements.

The elements are carbon (graphite) and hydrogen (H2).

So, to form the molecule, we break C-C bonds in graphite and H-H bonds in H2.

The number of C atoms in the molecule: let's see, in the formula we're considering, perhaps it's 10 C atoms? Or from earlier, I thought it might be 9 C atoms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of C atoms in the molecule.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group has 4 C atoms? Or wait, (CH3)2C=CH is a propene group plus a methyl group. So, (CH3)2 is two CH3 groups attached to a C, which is double-bonded to another CH. So that's 3 C atoms: (CH3)2-C=CH.

Then, the middle part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

That's three C atoms.

Then, the last part: CH=C(CH3)2.

That's three C atoms.

So, total C atoms: 3 +3 +3=9.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me see:

(CH3)2C=CH → 3 C.

CH2 → 1 C.

CH(CH3) → 1 C.

CH2 → 1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2 → 3 C.

So, 3 +1 +1 +1 +3=9 C atoms.

Each C atom comes from graphite, which has C-C bonds. Each C atom in the molecule is part of the original C in graphite, which has C-C bonds.

When we atomize C, we break all the C-C bonds into C atoms.

The atomization energy given is 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.

So, for 9 C atoms, the total atomization energy would be 9 × 1000 =9000 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, the atomization energy is 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms. So, for 9 moles of C atoms, it's 9 × 1000 =9000 kJ.

Wait, but the bond energy for C-C is 200 kJ/mol. So, how many C-C bonds are being broken when atomizing 9 moles of C atoms?

In graphite, the structure is a network of C atoms with each C bonded to three others. But for the purpose of atomization, each C atom has, on average, 2 bonds (since each bond is shared between two C atoms). So, the number of C-C bonds broken per mole of C atoms is 3/2 per mole.

Wait, let me think: each C atom in graphite has three C-C bonds. But each bond is shared between two C atoms. So, the number of bonds per mole is (3/2) × 6.022e23 ≈ 9.033e23 bonds per mole.

But the bond energy is given per mole of bonds. So, each mole of C atoms requires breaking (3/2) moles of C-C bonds.

So, for 9 moles of C atoms, the number of C-C bonds broken is 9 × (3/2) =13.5 moles.

Each C-C bond has energy 200 kJ/mol, so the energy released when breaking those bonds is 13.5 × 200 =2700 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the atomization energy is the energy required to break the bonds. So, the energy is positive because it's an endothermic process. So, the bond energy is negative when bonds are broken, but I'm a bit confused about the sign here.

Alternatively, perhaps the atomization energy is the energy needed to break the bonds, so for each mole of C atoms, you need 1000 kJ. But the C-C bond energy is 200 kJ per mole. So, the number of C-C bonds per mole of C atoms is 1000 kJ / 200 kJ per bond → 5 bonds per mole of C atoms. Wait, that doesn't make sense, because each C atom has three bonds, but each bond is between two C atoms, so per mole of C atoms, we have (3/2) moles of C-C bonds. So, 3/2 × 200 kJ =300 kJ per mole of C atoms. But the atomization energy is given as 1000 kJ per mole of C, which suggests that each C atom contributes 1000 kJ, but that can't be right because breaking three C-C bonds per C atom would only take 3 × 200 =600 kJ per C.

Hmm, perhaps the atomization energy given is the total energy required to break all bonds in a mole of C atoms, which is 1000 kJ/mol, so each mole of C requires 1000 kJ, regardless of how many bonds that is.

So, for our molecule, which has 9 C atoms, the C atomization energy would be 9 × 1000 =9000 kJ.

Similarly, for H atoms: the molecule has how many H atoms?

Let me recount. Earlier I thought 24 C-H bonds, each with one H. So 24 H atoms.

Plus, any H in CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps the molecule has 24 H atoms from C-H bonds, but the H-H bonds are in H2.

The number of H atoms in the molecule: each (CH3)2C=CH group has 7 H, as earlier. Then the middle part has 5 H, and the last group has 7 H, totaling 19. But that doesn't match with 24 C-H bonds. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the number of H atoms is 24, as each C-H bond corresponds to one H atom. So, 24 H atoms → 12 H2 molecules. So, the number of H-H bonds broken is 12 × (1 H2 molecule) → 12 H-H bonds.

Each H-H bond has an energy of 100 kJ/mol. So, the energy required to break these bonds is 12 × 100 =1200 kJ.

So, the total energy of bonds broken in the elements is:

Energy to break C-C bonds: 9 × 1000 kJ =9000 kJ.

Energy to break H-H bonds: 12 × 100 =1200 kJ.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because the C comes from graphite, which requires breaking C-C bonds, and the H comes from H2, which requires breaking H-H bonds.

So, the total bonds broken in the elements are 9000 (C) +1200 (H) =10200 kJ.

Now, the bonds formed in the molecule are the sum of all the bonds in the molecule.

Which we calculated earlier as 11000 kJ.

So, the enthalpy of formation is the sum of bonds broken (elements) minus bonds formed (molecule).

ΔHf° = (10200) - (11000) = -800 kJ/mol.

But wait, that would make the enthalpy of formation negative, which suggests it's exothermic. But let me double-check.

Wait, no, wait. The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bonds broken in elements)] - [Σ (Bonds formed in molecule)]

So, 10200 (bonds broken) - 11000 (bonds formed) = -800 kJ/mol.

But wait, that's a negative value. However, looking at the options, none of them are negative. The options are all positive, except option B is 67.4, which is positive but small.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the bonds in the molecule.

Earlier, I calculated:

C-C bonds: 4 single → 4 ×200 =800.

C=C bonds: 2 ×300=600.

C-H bonds:24 ×400=9600.

Total:800+600+9600=11000.

So that's correct.

Now, bonds broken: C atomization is 9 ×1000=9000.

H atomization is 24 H atoms → 12 H2 molecules → 12 ×100=1200.

Total bonds broken:9000+1200=10200.

So, ΔHf°=10200 - 11000= -800 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have a negative value. Did I mix up the formula?

Wait, perhaps the formula should be the opposite: bonds formed minus bonds broken.

Wait, no, the correct formula is bonds broken minus bonds formed because you're putting in energy to break bonds (which is endothermic) and getting energy out when forming bonds (exothermic). So, if the bonds formed release more energy than was put in, the overall is exothermic (negative ΔH).

But the options don't have -800. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C and H atoms.

Alternative approach: Let's use the molecular formula to find the number of C and H.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of each element:

C:

Each (CH3)2 group has 2 C per CH3, but attached to a central C.

So, (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C (two CH3 and one central C), plus the CH.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Each (CH3)2C=CH is C4H6 (since (CH3)2C=CH has 4 C and 6 H: 2*(3 H from CH3) + 1 H from CH).

Then, the middle part: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

CH2 is CH2: 1 C and 2 H.

CH(CH3): 1 C and 1 H (since CH3 contributes 3 H, but the CH has one more H? No, CH(CH3) would have one H attached to the central C, but the CH3 has three H. So, CH(CH3) has 1 H on the central C plus 3 H from CH3 → 4 H.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's just try to count each C and H.

In (CH3)2C=CH:

- 3 C atoms (two CH3 and one C in the double bond).

- 7 H (each CH3 has 3 H, and the CH has 1 H).

Then, the next part: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

- CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

- CH(CH3): 1 C, 1 H (the CH3 brings 3 H, but the C is bonded to CH2, CH(CH3), and another CH2 → perhaps the H count here is 1).

Wait, perhaps it's better to move away from this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C12H16 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the number of C atoms is 10.

But perhaps I should proceed with the initial numbers.

So, according to my previous counts:

ΔHf°= -800 kJ/mol.

But the options are all positive. So perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the C atomization energy is 1000 kJ per mole, but that's per mole of C atoms. So, for 9 C atoms, it's 9 ×1000 =9000 kJ.

But wait, each C atom is in a C-C bond, so when you atomize, each C requires breaking (number of bonds × bond energy).

But perhaps I should calculate the number of C-C bonds per mole of C atoms as 3/2 per mole, as each C has three bonds, and each bond is shared between two C atoms.

So, per mole of C atoms, the bonds broken would be (3/2) × 200 kJ/mol → 300 kJ/mol.

So, 9 moles of C atoms would require 9 ×300 =2700 kJ to atomize.

Wait, but the given atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol, which is per mole of C atoms, not per mole of C-C bonds.

So, perhaps I should use the given atomization energy directly.

So, for 9 C atoms, it's 9 ×1000 =9000 kJ.

Similarly, for 24 H atoms, which come from 12 H2 molecules, each requiring 100 kJ/mol, so 12 ×100=1200 kJ.

So, total bonds broken:9000 +1200=10200 kJ.

Bonds formed in molecule: 11000 kJ.

So, ΔHf°=10200−11000= -800 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have -800. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molecule's bonds.

Wait, perhaps I missed some C-C bonds in the molecule. Let me recount.

Earlier I thought there were 4 single C-C bonds and 2 double bonds.

Wait, let's list all the C-C bonds:

1. Between (CH3)2C= and CH: that's a single bond.

2. Between CH and CH2: single.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3): single.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2: single.

5. Between CH2 and CH: single.

Wait, that's five single C-C bonds, not four.

So, 5 ×200=1000.

Plus 2 C=C bonds: 2 ×300=600.

Total C-C and C=C bonds:1600.

C-H bonds:24 ×400=9600.

Total bonds in molecule:1600 +9600=11200.

Ah, so I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds earlier. I thought there were four, but actually, there are five.

So, the correct sum is 5 ×200 (C-C) +2 ×300 (C=C) +24 ×400 (C-H) =1000 +600 +9600 =11200 kJ.

So, bonds formed:11200.

Bonds broken:10200.

ΔHf°=10200 −11200 = -1000 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's even worse. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds again.

Wait, let's recount the C-C bonds in the molecule.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the single bonds between C atoms are:

1. Between (CH3)2C and CH.

Between CH and CH2.

Between CH2 and CH(CH3).

Between CH(CH3) and CH2.

Between CH2 and CH.

So that's five single C-C bonds.

Each single C-C is 200 kJ: 5 ×200=1000.

Double bonds: two C=C → 2 ×300=600.

Total C-C and C=C bonds:1600.

C-H bonds:24 ×400=9600.

Total: 1600 +9600=11200.

So, bonds broken in elements:10200.

ΔHf°=10200−11200= -1000 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I've made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A) 11200 kJ/mol.

Option B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

Option C) 11.44 kJ/g.

Option D) 1900 kJ/g.

Hmm, none are -1000.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Perhaps the enthalpy of formation is bonds formed minus bonds broken. Let me try that.

ΔHf°=11200 −10200=1000 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, but option A is 11200.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the bond energy content of the molecule, not the enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the enthalpy of formation but the standard enthalpy of combustion or something else. But the question says "enthalpy of formation."

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C and H atoms.

Let me recount.

Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group:

- 3 C atoms (two CH3 and one C).

- 7 H (2×3 +1).

Then, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Each CH2:1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 C, 1 H (the CH has one H, CH3 has three). Wait, no, the CH(CH3) group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. So the central CH(CH3) has one H attached to the C, and the CH3 has three H. So, total H in CH(CH3) is 1 +3=4 H? No, that can't be right. Wait, each CH(CH3) would contribute one H on the central C, but the CH3 brings three H. So, the CH(CH3) group has one H attached to the C, and the CH3 has three H, but those are separate.

Wait, perhaps this is complicating things. Let me count each H:

- Each (CH3)2C=CH: 7 H.

- Each CH2: 2 H.

- Each CH(CH3):1 H (on the central C), plus the CH3 brings 3 H, but those are part of the CH3 group.

Wait, let me think of each group:

Each (CH3)2C=CH: 7 H.

Then, the next groups: CH2 (2 H), CH(CH3) (1 H), CH2 (2 H).

So, 2+1+2=5 H.

Then, CH=C(CH3)2:

CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H. So, 1 + (2×3) =7 H.

So total H:7+5+7=19 H.

Wait, but earlier I thought 24 H from C-H bonds. But according to this, it's 19 H.

Hmm, perhaps I have a mistake here. Let me see each C-H bond.

Each (CH3)2C=CH has 7 C-H bonds.

Each CH2 has 2 C-H bonds.

Each CH(CH3) has 1 C-H bond.

CH=C(CH3)2 has 1 C-H bond.

So, that's 7 +2 +1 +1=11 C-H bonds? That doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting.

Each (CH3)2C=CH:

- 2 CH3 groups: 2 ×3=6 C-H.

- CH:1 C-H.

Total:7.

Then, CH2: 2 C-H.

CH(CH3):1 C-H.

CH2: 2 C-H.

CH:1 C-H.

CH3 groups in the last part: each CH3 has 3 C-H, and there are two of them → 2 ×3=6.

So, adding up:

7 (from first part) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH) +6 (two CH3) =7+2+1+2+1+6=19.

So 19 C-H bonds.

Wait, but earlier I thought 24. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and the correct count is 19 C-H bonds.

So, C-H bonds:19 ×400=7600 kJ.

C-C bonds:5 ×200=1000.

C=C bonds: 2×300=600.

Total bonds in molecule:7600+1000+600=9200.

Bonds broken:

C:9 ×1000=9000.

H:19 H atoms → 9.5 H2 molecules. But H2 is diatomic, so 9.5 ×100=950 kJ.

Wait, no, 19 H atoms would require 9.5 H2 molecules, so 9.5 ×100=950 kJ.

So, total bonds broken:9000 +950=9950 kJ.

ΔHf°=9950 −9200=750 kJ/mol.

But that's not any of the options either.

This is getting really confusing. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the enthalpy of formation but the heat of combustion or something else. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the options.

Option A is 11200 kJ/mol, which matches the initial calculation when I thought the molecule had 24 C-H bonds and 5 C-C bonds plus 2 C=C bonds.

So, if the correct bonds sum to 11200, and the bonds broken are 10200, then ΔHf°=10200−11200= -1000 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the bond energy content of the molecule, not the enthalpy of formation. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is to calculate the difference between the bonds in the molecule and the bonds in the elements.

Wait, the formula for enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf = [Σ (elements' bond energies)] − [Σ (molecule's bond energies)]

So, yes, that's what I did earlier.

If the molecule's bonds sum to 11200, and elements' bonds sum to 10200, then ΔHf=10200−11200=−1000.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the counting.

Wait, perhaps the molecular structure is such that there are more C-C bonds. Let me recount.

In the molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each ' - ' represents a single C-C bond.

So, between:

(CH3)2C=CH and CH2: one single bond.

CH2 and CH(CH3): one single.

CH(CH3) and CH2: one single.

CH2 and CH: one single.

CH and C in the double bond: nothing, as it's a double bond.

So that's four single bonds.

Plus the two double bonds.

So, four ×200=800.

Two ×300=600.

C-H bonds:19 ×400=7600.

Total:800+600+7600=9000.

Wait, that can't be right. That brings the total to 9000.

Hmm, I'm getting confused again. Maybe I should stop here and look for the answer.

Looking back, the only option that matches the initial calculation of 11200 kJ/mol is option A.

But according to my calculation, the enthalpy of formation would be -1000 kJ/mol, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies in elements)] + [Σ (Bond energies in molecule)].

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the bonds in the elements minus the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, no, that would give the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done per mole of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the total bond energy of the molecule, not the enthalpy of formation. Because 11200 kJ is option A.

But the question specifically says "enthalpy of formation".

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule minus the sum of the bonds in the elements.

So, ΔHf = (sum bonds in molecule) - (sum bonds in elements).

Wait, but I thought it's the opposite.

Wait, the standard method is:

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of elements) - Σ (Bond energies of molecule).

Which is bonds broken (elements) minus bonds formed (molecule).

So, 10200 -11200=−1000.

But no option has that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as counting only the C and H bonds without considering the C-C bonds in the molecule.

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the heat of formation using the given bond energies, considering only the H-H and C bonds, not the C-C bonds in the molecule.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the C-C bonds in the molecule are not considered because they come from the same element, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule has zero C-C bonds.

But that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the C-H bonds.

So, sum of C-H bonds: 24 ×400=9600.

Sum of H-H bonds broken:12 ×100=1200.

Sum of C-C bonds broken:9 ×1000=9000.

ΔHf=9000 +1200 -9600= 1200.

But 1200 is not an option either.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps I'm supposed to use the enthalpy of atomization for carbon to account for the C-C bonds in the molecule.

Wait, the atomization energy is the energy required to break all C-C bonds in graphite to form C atoms. So, the sum of C-C bonds in the molecule would be 5 ×200=1000.

So, the energy for those bonds is 1000 kJ.

But the atomization energy per C atom is 1000 kJ, so for 9 C atoms, it's 9000 kJ.

So, (9000) − (1000) =8000.

Then, the C-H bonds:24×400=9600.

H-H bonds:12 ×100=1200.

Total bonds broken in elements:9000+1200=10200.

Bonds formed in molecule:1000 (C-C) +9600 (C-H) =10600.

ΔHf=10200 −10600= −400 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option A) 11200 kJ/mol as it matches the initial calculation, but I'm not confident.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were considered:

1. **Bond Energies in the Molecule**:  
   - The molecule contains:  
     - **5 single C-C bonds**: Each contributes 200 kJ/mol, totaling \(5 \times 200 = 1000 \, \text{kJ/mol}\).  
     - **2 double C=C bonds**: Each contributes 300 kJ/mol, totaling \(2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol}\).  
     - **24 C-H bonds**: Each contributes 400 kJ/mol, totaling \(24 \times 400 = 9600 \, \text{kJ/mol}\).  
   - Total bond energy in the molecule:  
     \[
     1000 + 600 + 9600 = 11200 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
     \]

2. **Bonds Broken in the Elements**:  
   - The elements are carbon (graphite) and hydrogen (H₂).  
     - **Carbon**: Each mole of carbon requires 1000 kJ/mol to atomize. The molecule contains 9 carbon atoms, so the energy required is \(9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol}\).  
     - **Hydrogen**: Each mole of H₂ requires 100 kJ/mol to break. The molecule contains 24 hydrogen atoms, which come from 12 H₂ molecules. The energy required is \(12 \times 100 = 1200 \, \text{kJ/mol}\).  
   - Total energy to break bonds in the elements:  
     \[
     9000 + 1200 = 10200 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
     \]

3. **Enthalpy of Formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = \text{Bonds Broken} - \text{Bonds Formed}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = 10200 - 11200 = -1000 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]  
   However, this value does not match any of the provided options. Given the complexity of the calculations and the mismatch with the options, the most plausible answer based on the bond energy sum in the molecule is **11200 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Critical Analysis of Options**:  
- **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**: Matches the total bond energy in the molecule, suggesting it represents the bond energy content rather than the enthalpy of formation.  
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**, **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)**, and **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: These values are inconsistent with the bond energy calculations and are likely incorrect.  

Based on the reasoning above, the best choice is **Option A**.  

Answer: A
