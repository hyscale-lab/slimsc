Okay, so I just landed this awesome job at a structural biology lab at Stanford. My first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The principal investigator gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I need to pick the right one. 

Hmm, I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid should have the correct promoter and the gene should be in frame with it. Also, E. coli uses certain codons more frequently, so the plasmid should have the gene optimized for E. coli codon usage. Oh wait, but BL21 strains are often used because they lack the trp and lon proteases, which reduces degradation of the expressed proteins. But the question is about choosing the right plasmid.

Looking at the options, they all look similar. Wait, the options are probably different plasmid sequences. But how? Let me think. Each plasmid starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then look for the end. Also, the presence of a stop codon is important. Wait, the options are labeled A, B, C, D. 

In the given amino acid sequence, does it have any internal stop codons? Probably not, because it's a full-length protein. So the plasmid should have the correct ORF from start to stop, without any premature termination.

Wait, but what about the reading frame? The plasmid's DNA sequence should be in the same reading frame as the promoter and ribosome binding site. So the ATG must be correctly positioned.

Looking at the plasmid options, each starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the first few nucleotides are ATG, which is methionine. But the sequence of the DNA after that will determine if it's correctly in frame.

Wait, another thing: BL21 strains are typically used with plasmids that have an origin of replication compatible with E. coli. But the options probably all have that, so maybe not relevant here.

I think the main issue is whether the plasmid includes the correct multiple cloning site (MCS) with the right restriction sites for inserting the gene. But in the question, the plasmid sequences are given as the options, so perhaps they vary in the presence of certain sequences.

Wait, the given options are all long DNA sequences. Let me think about how they might differ. Maybe the presence of the correct RBS (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) is important. Or perhaps the start codon is in frame.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I need to check for the presence of a stop codon at the end of the coding sequence. The amino acid sequence ends with a certain codon, so the DNA sequence should end with the appropriate triplet.

Looking at the last part of the provided amino acid sequence: it ends with ...TGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA

Wait, no, the given amino acid sequence is a long string without knowing where the stop is. But the plasmid's DNA should have a termination codon at the end. So in the DNA sequences of the options, the very end should have a TAA, TAG, or TGA, which are stop codons.

Looking at the end of each option:

Option A: ...TGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA

Wait, the end of option A is ...ACTGA. ACTGA is the DNA sequence, which corresponds to the amino acid sequence ending with, well, let's see. ACTG is Thr, then A. Wait, wait, the DNA is read in triplets as codons, but the plasmid's DNA should have a stop codon after the gene. So the last few nucleotides before the end should be a stop codon.

Looking at the end of each option. Let's take option B:

Option B: Ends with ...AGACTGA. Wait, AGA is arginine, TGA is a stop codon. So in the DNA, the sequence would be TGA at the end, meaning a stop codon. So looking at the last few letters of each option.

Alternatively, perhaps the last triplet is the stop codon. Let me check.

Option A's last part: ...ACTGA. So, the last three are TGA, which is a stop. So that's good.

Wait, looking at the very end of each option's DNA sequence. Let me see:

Option A: The entire DNA sequence, the last few letters? Let me see. The last part is ...ACTGA. So the last three nucleotides would be TGA, which is a stop.

Option B: The last part is ...AGACTGA. So the last three are TGA.

Option C: Ends with ...AGACTGA.

Option D: Ends with ...AGACTGA.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the correct plasmid. So all options have a TGA at the end? Or perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of the correct start and stop codons. Also, the amino acid sequence provided starts with M (methionine), so the DNA must start with ATG.

Looking at all options, they all start with ATG, so that's correct.

Another important point is whether the reading frame is maintained. The plasmid must have the gene in the correct frame with the RBS and promoter. But without the exact plasmid info, perhaps the key is the presence of a stop codon. Or perhaps the plasmid includes a T7 promoter, which is often used in BL21 strains, which are T7 RNA polymerase deficient but are induced by IPTG.

Wait, the presence of a T7 promoter in the plasmid is important. Let me check the beginning of each option.

Looking at the beginning of the DNA sequences.

Option A: ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCCGCATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGCGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA

Wait, looking at the very beginning of option A: ATG GAG GAG CCC... So the first codon is ATG (Met), next is GAG (Glu), then GAG (E), then GAG (E), etc. So the start is correct.

But wait, when the gene is cloned into a plasmid, the ATG should be in frame with the RBS and promoter. If the plasmid's MCS has the correct sites, the gene would be in frame.

Another important point is whether the plasmid is designed for expression in E. coli BL21. BL21 strains are often used with plasmids that have a T7 promoter because they are deficient in T7 RNA polymerase and require induction with IPTG.

Looking at the plasmid sequences, perhaps the presence of a T7 promoter is indicated. Looking at the beginning of each option, I see:

Looking for the presence of the T7 promoter. The T7 promoter sequence is usually around the -10 and -35 regions. The T7 promoter is a specific sequence recognized by T7 RNA polymerase.

But without knowing the exact sequences, perhaps the presence of the T7 promoter can be inferred by the presence of specific sequences like CGAAGCTT or others. Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid includes a T7 promoter before the ATG.

Wait, looking at option A's start: ATG GAG GAG CCC... So the ATG is the start codon, but the T7 promoter would come before that.

Wait, but in the given options, each starts with ATG, implying that the ATG is the first part of the coding sequence. So perhaps the plasmid includes a promoter upstream of this.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequences provided are the actual inserts, meaning the start codon is the first nucleotide. But that's not possible because the promoter must come before the start codon.

Wait, perhaps each plasmid's DNA sequence includes the promoter. So I need to check if the sequence before the ATG has a promoter.

Looking at option A: the very start is ATG... So that's the coding sequence. But that can't be right because the promoter would come before the start codon.

Wait, perhaps each option represents the entire plasmid, including promoter and everything. But that's unlikely because plasmids are much longer, but perhaps the given sequences are the inserts.

Alternatively, maybe the options are inserts with the gene, and the presence of a RBS is important.

Wait, another thought: the ATG is the start codon, but the RBS (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) is upstream of it. The RBS is usually a sequence like AGGAGG or similar, rich in G and C, around 6-8 nucleotides upstream of the start codon.

Looking at the beginning of each option, perhaps I can check for the presence of such a sequence.

Option A starts with ATG GAG GAG ... so the sequence before ATG is not present. So perhaps the options include only the coding sequence after the RBS and promoter.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently.

The question is to select the plasmid that correctly expresses the Human P53 protein. So the plasmid must have the correct ORF, with the start and stop codons correctly placed, and no frame shifts or premature stops.

Looking at the options, perhaps the presence of a TGA (stop codon) at the end is critical. Let me check each option's end.

Option A ends with ...ACTGA. So the last three nucleotides are TGA. That's a stop codon. So the gene ends correctly.

Option B ends with ...AGACTGA. So the last three are TGA, same as option A.

Option C: Let me check. The end is ...AGACTGA. So TGA again.

Option D: same as B and C, ends with TGA.

Wait, so all options have a TGA at the end. Hmm, can't be the deciding factor.

Another possibility is that one of the options includes a frameshift or has a different reading frame. Let's think about the DNA sequences.

The correct ORF must be in the same reading frame as the RBS and promoter. So if the gene is cloned into the plasmid in the correct orientation, the start codon will be in frame.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct option has the correct reading frame. To check this, I can look for a few codons after ATG and see if they match the given amino acid sequence.

The amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSDPSVEPPL...

So the first few amino acids are Met (M), Glu (E), Glu (E), Pro (P), etc.

Looking at the DNA sequences, after ATG (which is M), the next codon is GAG (E), then GAG (E), then GAG (E), then CGC (R), then AGT (S), etc.

Wait, let me break down the DNA into codons.

Option A: ATG GAG GAG CGC AGT CAG ATC CTA GCG TCG AGC CGG CTT CTG AGT CAG GAA ACA TTT TCA GAC CTA TGG AAA ACT ACT TC C TGAAAA...

Wait, that's the first part.

So the first few codons: ATG (M), GAG (E), GAG (E), CGC (R), AGT (S), CAG (Q), ATC (I), CTA (L), GCG (A), TCG (S), AGC (S), CGG (R), CTT (L), CTG (L), AGT (S), CAG (Q), GAA (E), ACA (T), TTT (F), TCA (S), GAC (D), CTA (L), TGG (W), AAA (K), ACT (T), ACT (T), etc.

Wait, the amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSDPSVEPPL...

So the first few amino acids:

M (ATG), E (GAG), E (GAG), P (CGC?), wait no, CGC is arginine (R), but the third amino acid in the protein is E.

Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

The amino acid sequence starts: MEEPQSDPSVEPPL...

So the first four amino acids are M, E, E, P.

Looking at the DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG (M), then GAG (E), then GAG (E), then CGC (R). Wait, that's M, E, E, R. But the protein starts with M, E, E, P. So R is arginine, but the protein expects proline (P) at the fourth position. That suggests a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong option. Let me check another option.

Looking at option B:

Option B starts with ATG GAG GAG CCC ... Let me see the codons.

ATG (M), GAG (E), GAG (E), CCC (P), AGT (S), CAG (Q), ATC (I), CTA (L), GCG (A), TCG (S), AGC (S), CGG (R), CTT (L), CTG (L), AGT (S), CAG (Q), GAA (E), ACA (T), TTT (F), TCA (S), GAC (D), CTA (L), TGG (W), AAA (K), ACT (T), etc.

So the fourth codon is CCC, which is proline (P). So the amino acids would be M (ATG), E (GAG), E (GAG), P (CCC), which matches the protein's start: MEEP. 

Ah, so option B's first four codons are ATG, GAG, GAG, CCC, which translates to M, E, E, P. This matches the beginning of the given amino acid sequence.

In contrast, option A's fourth codon is CGC (R), which would give a different sequence.

So option B's DNA sequence starts with ATG, GAG, GAG, CCC, leading to the correct start of the protein.

So which option is correct? The one that starts with ATG followed by GAG, GAG, CCC. Because that matches M, E, E, P.

Looking back, option A's fourth codon is CGC (R), which would make the third amino acid R, not P. So that's incorrect.

So the correct plasmid is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options. Let's look at option C.

Option C starts with ATG GAG GAG CCC. So same as option B?

Wait, looking at option C's beginning. The very start is ATG GAG GAG CCC, which would also give M, E, E, P.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: [beginning] ATG GAG GAG CGC ...

Option B: [beginning] ATG GAG GAG CCC ...

Option C: Same as B? Let me see.

Option C: ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA...

Wait, the first part is ATG GAG GAG CGC AGT CAG ... Wait, same as option A? Or not.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look again.

Option A starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA...

Breaking into codons:

ATG (M), GAG (E), GAG (E), CGC (R), AGT (S), CAG (Q), ATC (I), CTA (L), GCG (A), TCG (S), AGC (S), CGG (R), CTT (L), CTG (L), AGT (S), CAG (Q), GAA (E), ACA (T), TTT (F), TCA (S), GAC (D), CTA (L), TGG (W), AAA (K), ACT (T), ACT (T), etc.

So first four codons: M, E, E, R. Which doesn't match the protein.

Option B: ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA...

Wait, the beginning is the same as option A? Or different?

Wait, looking at option B, the very first part is ATG GAG GAG CCC. Let me check.

Wait the given options are a bit hard to parse because they're long. Let me look again.

Option A: starts with ATG GAG GAG CGC.

Option B: starts with ATG GAG GAG CCC.

Option C: starts with ATG GAG GAG CGC.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. Oh, wait, the options are given as they are.

Wait, looking at the user's message, the options are:

Option A) starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGC...

Option B) starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGC...

Wait, wait, looking at the user message:

Option A: ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCCGCATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGCGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA

Option C: starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA

Option D: same as C perhaps?

So to clarify, option B's initial part is ATGGAGGAGCCCC, so after ATG, the next codons are GAG, GAG, CCC.

So the first four codons in option B: ATG (M), GAG (E), GAG (E), CCC (P). Which matches the protein's start.

In option A, the first four after ATG are GAG, GAG, CGC (R), which doesn't match.

So the correct plasmid is option B.


To determine the correct plasmid for expressing the Human P53 protein in *E. coli* BL21, the plasmid must contain the gene in the correct reading frame, with the start codon (ATG) and stop codon (TGA) properly positioned, and the amino acid sequence must match the provided sequence.

### Key Observations:
1. **Start Codon (ATG)**: All options begin with ATG, indicating the correct start codon for methionine (M). This is consistent with the protein sequence starting with M.

2. **Stop Codon (TGA)**: The protein sequence does not explicitly include a stop codon, but the plasmid must terminate with one. All options end with TGA, ensuring proper termination.

3. **Reading Frame and Sequence Match**: The protein sequence begins with **MEEPQSDPSVEPPL...**, corresponding to the first few amino acids: Methionine (M), Glutamic Acid (E), Glutamic Acid (E), Proline (P). The DNA sequence must match this sequence when translated into amino acids.

   - **Option A**: The first four codons after ATG are **GAG, GAG, CGC**, translating to **E, E, R**. This does not match the protein sequence, as the fourth amino acid should be Proline (P), not Arginine (R).
   - **Option B**: The first four codons after ATG are **GAG, GAG, CCC**, translating to **E, E, P**. This matches the protein sequence perfectly.
   - **Option C**: The sequence is identical to Option B, starting with **GAG, GAG, CCC**, and thus also matches the protein sequence.
   - **Option D**: The sequence is identical to Option B, starting with **GAG, GAG, CCC**, and thus also matches the protein sequence.

4. **Conclusion**: Options B, C, and D all match the protein sequence at the start. However, the question implies selecting one correct plasmid, and based on the analysis, **Option B** is the most likely candidate.

### Final Answer:
The correct plasmid is **Option B**, as it aligns with the provided amino acid sequence and ensures proper expression of the Human P53 protein in *E. coli* BL21.

**Answer: B**
