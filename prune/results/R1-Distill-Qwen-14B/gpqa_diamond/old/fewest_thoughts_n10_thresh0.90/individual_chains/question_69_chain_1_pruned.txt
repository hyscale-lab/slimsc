Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber at CERN. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The details given are the proper lifetime of X⁰, which is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy of the particle in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, alright, let me think. I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime because of time dilation. The formula for the observed lifetime τ is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Oh right, γ is calculated using the particle's velocity. And since the particle is moving at a high energy, we can probably approximate βγ as the total energy divided by the mass. Because energy E is gamma times m c squared. So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). But wait, the units here are GeV, so I might need to be careful with units, but maybe it's okay.

So, E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28, which is a bit over 27. So 8 would give a bit more than 27. So γ is approximately 7.91, which is about 8.

Wait, another way, 3.41 * 7.91 is around 27? Let me compute 3.41 * 8: 3.41 *8 = 27.28. So 27 is just a bit less than that. So 27 /3.41 = approximately 7.916. So γ ≈7.916.

Now, the lifetime τ = γ τ₀. So τ = 7.916 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that. 7.916 *8 is about 63.328, so τ ≈63.328e-16 s. That's 6.3328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does this relate to the resolution needed? I think the resolution refers to the precision required in measuring the decay products' positions so that we can see the decay. The idea is that the particle travels some distance before decaying, and if the resolution isn't fine enough, we might not detect that the decay happened at a particular point.

Wait, right, the length the particle travels before decaying is L = βγ c τ₀. Because L is the speed (βc) multiplied by the time in the lab frame (γ τ₀). So L = βγ c τ₀. But since beta is approximately 1 for high-energy particles, maybe we can approximate
