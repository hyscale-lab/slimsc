Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, but I need to figure out if there's excess acid or base left after that.

First, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base because the pH depends on the excess H+ or OH- ions after neutralization.

Let me start with the acids. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a metal hydroxide. So, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will completely dissociate.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So, for moles, I need to account for that.

Okay, let's compute the moles for each component:

1. **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):**
   Molarity (M) = moles / volume (L)
   So, moles = M * L. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):**
   Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

3. **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):**
   Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
   But each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to see what happens when these are mixed. Since HCl and Ba(OH)2 are strong acid and base, they will react completely.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, donating OH- ions. When H+ and OH- combine, they form water. So, the reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

Wait, but also, CH3COOH is a weak acid. So, I need to consider whether it can react with any remaining OH- after the strong acid and base have reacted.

So, first let's determine the net H+ or OH- from HCl and Ba(OH)2.

HCl provides H+:
Moles of H+ from HCl = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2 provides OH-:
Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.18 moles.

So, when we mix them, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. Let's see which is in excess.

H+ from HCl: 0.08
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18

So, OH- is in excess. The excess OH- would be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, and Ba(OH)2 as a strong base will completely dissociate. So, the H+ from HCl is 0.08
