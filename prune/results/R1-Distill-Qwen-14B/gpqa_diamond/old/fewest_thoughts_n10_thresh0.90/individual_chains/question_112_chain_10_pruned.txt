Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's take it slow.

The problem says we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when something is proportional, we need to normalize it. So first, I should find the normalization constant to get the actual state vector.

Wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So the basis is orthonormal. That makes things easier because the inner product of |up> and |down> is zero.

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To normalize, I need to compute the norm (the squared magnitude of the coefficients). The norm squared is |1+i|² + |2 - i|².

Calculating each term: |1+i| is sqrt(1² +1²) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2. |2 -i| is sqrt(2² + (-1)²) = sqrt(4 +1)= sqrt(5), so squared is 5. So total norm squared is 2 + 5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next part: we have an operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the basis for this matrix? Oh, because the operator is given in terms of eigenstates of the z-projection, which are |up> and |down>. So the operator isn't the usual spin-z operator, which has diagonal elements. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Because when i=1 and j=2 (i≠j), it's ħ/2. Similarly for i=2 and j=1.

So what is this operator? It looks like it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A_ij would be (ħ/2) * X_ij. So the operator could be written as (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, so the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x. But the question is asking for the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of this operator. Since |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, perhaps we can find its expansion in the X-basis or find the expectation value.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value and the probabilities directly using the given state and the operator.

Wait, the question says: "Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given..." So the operator's eigenstates are the possible outcomes when we measure. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, since σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so the operator has eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), I think.

But to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator. Alternatively, we can compute the expectation value by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly. The expectation value of the operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, the operator A has matrix elements [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So when we compute <A>, it's the sum over i,j of A_ij * <i| alpha> * <alpha |j> ?

Wait, no. Because matrix elements are A_ij, and expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha> = sum_{i,j} A_ij * <i| alpha> * <alpha |j>.

But in the matrix, A_ij is non-zero only when i != j. So for the 2x2 case, A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0.

So <A> = A_12 * <1| alpha> * <alpha |2> + A_21 * <2| alpha> * <alpha |1>.

But since A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_21 is same as A_12, but wait no, A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j. So A_12 = ħ/2, A_21 = ħ/2, but since in the matrix, A is symmetric, so A_ij = A_ji.

So <A> = (ħ/2) [ <1|alpha> <alpha|2> + <2|alpha> <alpha|1> ].

But wait, the sum is over all i and j, so for i=1, j=2 and i=2, j=1. So it's (ħ/2) [ c1 c2* + c2 c1* ], where c1 is the coefficient of |1> and c2 is coefficient of |2>.

Wait, let me write |alpha> as c1 |up> + c2 |down>. So c1 = (1 + i)/sqrt(7), c2 = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So <A> is (ħ/2) [ c1 c2^* + c2 c1^* ].

Hmm, because <1| alpha> is c1, and <alpha |2> is c2^*, and vice versa it's <2| alpha> is c2, <alpha |1> is c1^*.

So <A> = (ħ/2) [ c1 c2^* + c2 c1^* ].

Wait, that expression is (ħ/2) times 2 Re(c1 c2^*). Because c1 c2^* + c2 c1^* = 2 Re(c1 c2^*).

So <A> = ħ Re(c1 c2^* )

Let me compute c1 c2^*:

c1 = (1 + i)/sqrt(7), c2 = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

c1 c2^* = [(1 + i)(2 + i)] /7.

Wait, because c2^* is (2 + i)/sqrt(7). So (1 + i)(2 + i) = 1*2 + 1*i + i*2 + i*i = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So numerator is (1 +3i), so c1 c2^* = (1 +3i)/7.

The real part is 1/7.

So Re(c1 c2^*) = 1/7.

So <A> = ħ * (1/7) = ħ/7.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have hbar/sqrt(7), others have multiples. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, <A> = (ħ/2) [ c1 c2^* + c2 c1^* ].

c1 = (1+i)/sqrt(7), c2 = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute c1 c2^*:

(1+i)(2 + i) = (1)(2) + (1)(i) + (i)(2) + (i)(i) = 2 + i + 2i + i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So c1 c2^* = (1+3i)/(7). Similarly, c2 c1^* is (2 -i)(1 -i)/7.

Wait, let me compute c2 c1^*: (2 -i)(1 -i) = 2*1 +2*(-i) -i*1 + i^2 = 2 -2i -i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) = 1 -3i.

So c2 c1^* = (1 -3i)/7.

So c1 c2^* + c2 c1^* = [ (1 +3i) + (1 -3i) ] /7 = (2)/7.

So [c1 c2^* + c2 c1^*] = 2/7.

Then <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

Oh, I see. So the average value is ħ/7. Looking at the options, option A says hbar/7, and option C says hbar/sqrt(7). So in the average, option A is a possible candidate.

Now, the next part is calculating the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of the operator. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, since the operator is proportional to σ_x.

But in the z-basis, the |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probabilities, I need to compute |< +x | alpha >|^2 and |< -x | alpha >|^2.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the probability of getting +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Alternatively, express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator.

Wait, let me proceed. Let me find the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of the operator A.

The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, so any state can be written as a|+x> + b|-x>.

Then the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |a|^2, and similarly for |-ħ/2 is |b|^2.

So to find a and b, we compute the inner products.

Compute a = < +x | alpha >, b = < -x | alpha >.

So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So a = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | alpha > = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So this equals [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Simplify the numerator: 1 +i + 2 -i = 3. So a = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) = 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute b = < -x | alpha >.

| -x > = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

The numerator is 1 + i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So b =
