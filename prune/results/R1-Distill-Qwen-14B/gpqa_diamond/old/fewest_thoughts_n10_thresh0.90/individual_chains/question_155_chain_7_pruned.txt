Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem talks about an operator P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given in a 3x3 structure. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the matrix for P_z is diagonal in this basis. 

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z.

Hmm, the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So, ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z^2> - <P_z>^2 ).

First, I think I should find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared for the given state.

The state is a vector: let me denote it as |ψ> = [ -1/2; (√2)^-1; -1/2 ].

Wait, but I need to make sure if this vector is normalized. Let me check the sum of the squares of the elements. (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, and (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Oh, so it's already normalized. Good, no need to normalize.

Now, the operator P_z is given as:

P_z matrix is:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So, the diagonal matrix because the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z.

To find <P_z>, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue, weighted by the square of the amplitudes.

Wait, more precisely, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of |ψ> multiplied by P_z multiplied by |ψ>. Since P_z is diagonal, and the basis is orthonormal, each component is just the product of the amplitude squared and the eigenvalue.

So, the first component of the state is -1/2, and the corresponding eigenvalue is ħ. So the first term is (-1/2)^2 * ħ = (1/4) ħ.

The second component is 1/√2, and the eigenvalue is 0, so that term is zero.

The third component is -1/2, eigenvalue is -ħ. So (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, multiplied by (-ħ) gives - (1/4) ħ.

So, adding them up: (1/4) ħ + 0 + (-1/4) ħ = 0. So <P_z> is 0.

Next, I need <P_z^2>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would be each eigenvalue squared on the diagonal. So for P_z^2, the matrix is:

[ (ħ)^2    0          0      ]
[  0       0^2       0      ]
[  0       0      (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ²  0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0   ħ² ]

Now, the expectation value <P_z^2> is ψ† P_z² ψ. Again, since the matrix is diagonal, it's the sum of each |amplitude|^2 multiplied by the eigenvalue squared.

So, first term: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

Second term: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

Adding them: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, <P_z^2> = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - (<P_z>)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2, which matches this result.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of matrix multiplication to double-check.

Let me compute <P_z> more carefully. The state is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/
