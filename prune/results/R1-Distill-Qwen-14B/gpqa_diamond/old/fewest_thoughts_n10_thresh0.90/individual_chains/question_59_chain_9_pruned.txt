Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these acid-base problems. But let's take a deep breath and tackle this step by step.

The problem is asking for the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that's a mix of a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, but the type of acid or base matters a lot.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each of the substances. Moles are important because they'll determine how much each contributes to the overall acidity or basicity of the solution.

Let's start with the CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume (in liters). So for CH3COOH: 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Got that.

Next, the HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Moles = 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions.

Then, the Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-. So the moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So the moles of OH- will be 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to figure out if there's excess acid or base after they neutralize each other. Because H+ and OH- will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. Does it react with the base? I think that when a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they can react. But in this case, the HCl is a strong acid. Hmm, maybe I should consider all H+ sources and all OH- sources.

Wait, no. The problem is that the HCl is a strong acid, providing H+ ions, and the Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, providing OH- ions. They will react with each other first. Let me think: H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other.

So the moles of H+ from HCl are 0.08. The moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.18. So when they react, they'll form water. The reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the H+ moles are 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 moles of OH- (because 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10). So after this reaction, I have excess OH-.

But wait, I also have the CH3COOH. CH3COOH can act as an acid, donating H+ ions. But since after the reaction, I have excess OH- in the solution, I think the OH- will deprotonate any available acids.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of a strong base, the OH- is a strong base. So OH- will react with any available H+ from the CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release a lot of H+. Let me think about this.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider all the H+ and OH- in the solution. Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 will not only react with HCl but also with the acetic acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this methodically.

First, calculate all the moles:

- CH3COOH: 0.05 moles.
- HCl: 0.08 moles H+.
- Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles → 0.18 moles OH-.

So total H+ = 0.08 (from HCl) + any from CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute much H+ initially. However, in the presence of excess OH-, it might dissociate more, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to first consider the neutralization between H+ and OH- from HCl and Ba(OH)2.

HCl provides 0.08 moles H+. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles OH-.

They will neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. So after this, 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH- remain.

Now, there's also the CH3COOH. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ ions. But in a solution that's already basic (because of excess OH-), perhaps the CH3COOH will react with the remaining OH-.

Wait, but OH- is a strong base; it can deprotonate the weak acid. Let me think: OH- is a strong base and a good nucleophile. It can abstract a proton from the acetic acid.

So the reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- can react with a mole of CH3COOH to produce a mole of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

So I have 0.10 moles of OH- left after HCl and Ba(OH)2 reaction. And I have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. How much?

The OH- is 0.10 moles, and CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles OH-, leaving 0.05 moles OH- remaining.

Wait, but wait a second. When OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it's the OH- acting as a base, taking a proton from the acid. So each OH- can take one H+ from the CH3COOH. So the moles of CH3COOH and OH- will determine how much reacts.

In this case, OH- is 0.10, CH3COOH is 0.05. So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react, consuming 0.05 moles of OH-. That leaves 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So now, the solution has these remaining:

- 0.05 moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 after reacting with both HCl and CH3COOH.

But wait, I'm not sure if the OH- can actually deprotonate the CH3COOH. Because in solution, the OH- is a strong base, so it should be able to deprotonate the weak acid.

So after the reactions, the solution will have 0.05 moles of OH-.

But wait, the volume of the solution is the
