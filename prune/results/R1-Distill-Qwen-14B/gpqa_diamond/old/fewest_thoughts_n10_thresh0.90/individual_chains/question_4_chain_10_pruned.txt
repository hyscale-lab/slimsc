Okay, so I'm trying to answer this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't have a single isolated pole. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields behave. The equations are four in total, right? They involve things like divergence and curl of the fields.

In our universe, one of Maxwell's equations says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. That equation is ∇·B = 0. Oh right, because there are no isolated magnetic poles. So if in this other universe, you can have isolated poles, that equation must change. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. That means that equation is different.

But wait, the question is about which equations are different. Let me think about all four equations.

The four equations are:
1. Gauss's law for electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's law of induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Okay, so in our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B=0 because no monopoles. If there were monopoles, ∇·B would equal something involving the density of magnetic charge, maybe like ∇·B = ρ_m (where ρ_m is magnetic charge density). So equation 2 changes.

But what about the other equations? Faraday's law and Ampère's law. Do they change? Faraday's law relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. I don't think having monopoles affects this directly. Similarly, Ampère's law relates the curl of B to current and displacement current. So unless the presence of monopoles affects the sources in these equations, maybe those don't change.

Wait, but Maxwell's equations in a theory with magnetic monopoles would still need to account for them. So equation 2 changes, but what about the other equations? Let me think.

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is not zero. So equation 2 is modified. Also, looking at Ampère's law: in the standard form, the sources are electric current and displacement current. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect Ampère's law?

Wait, I think another of Maxwell's equations would change. Because in a universe with magnetic monopoles, there would be a current for magnetic fields as well. So maybe the curl of E would change? Or perhaps the curl of B?

Wait, Faraday's law is about the curl of E. In our universe, it's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If magnetic monopoles exist, maybe there's a term involving the magnetic current. Hmm, so perhaps Faraday's law would get an additional term. Alternatively, Ampère's law might get an added term related to magnetic current density.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become symmetric. So the modified equations would include terms for both electric and magnetic charges. So, for example, Gauss's law for magnetism would include a magnetic charge term, and Faraday's law would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, no, Faraday's law is about the time change of B. So perhaps, if there's a magnetic current, that would show up in Faraday's equation. Or perhaps in Ampère's. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let's think about the symmetrization of Maxwell's equations. If you have magnetic charges, then the equations become more symmetric. So the equation that had the divergence of B equal to zero would now equal the magnetic charge density. And the equation that had the divergence of E equal to the electric charge density would stay the same.

But what about the other two equations? In the standard form, Ampère's law includes the time derivative of E, which is the displacement current. If you have magnetic monopoles, maybe there's a similar term in Faraday's law.

Wait, I think that in a theory with magnetic monopoles, both Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law would change. Because Faraday's law would have a term that includes the magnetic current. Let me try to recall: Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles are sometimes written as:

∇·E = ρ/ε₀
∇·B = ρ_m / μ₀
∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m / ε₀
∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Wait, I'm not sure. Another version I remember is that when magnetic monopoles exist, the curl of E would have an additional term involving the magnetic current density. So the equation for ∇
