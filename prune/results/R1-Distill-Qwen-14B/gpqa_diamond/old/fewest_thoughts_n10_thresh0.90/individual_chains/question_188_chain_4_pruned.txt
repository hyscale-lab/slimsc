Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal structure is given by the formula derived from the crystal structure and the Miller indices of the plane. I think the general formula for the interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and hkl are the Miller indices. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, not cubic. Oh right, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal or trigonal system, depending on the angles.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a special case where all edges are equal (a = b = c) but the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh, the problem states that the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with a = b = c, but angles are 30 degrees each.

So, the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is a bit different. I think the formula involves the reciprocal of the plane indices and the angles. Let me recall. The formula for d in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) )) )

Wait, or is it more like d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ) )? Because in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so the cosine terms would be zero, and it reduces to the simple formula I mentioned earlier. But here, the angles are given as 30 degrees each.

Wait, but wait, in the rhombohedral structure, the angles are all equal, so perhaps this simplifies the formula. Let me write down the formula correctly. I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

d = (a² + b² + c² - 2ab cos gamma - 2ac cos beta - 2 bc cos alpha) / (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos beta - 2hl cos gamma ... wait, no, I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again.

Wait, no, that formula is for the volume of the unit cell. The interplanar distance formula is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos gamma)/(a²) - (2hl cos beta)/(a²) - (2kl cos alpha)/(a²)

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct expression. Alternatively, since the rhombohedral system has a = b = c, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal to 30 degrees, maybe the formula simplifies.

Hmm, wait. Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ) )

But since in rhombohedral a=b=c, and angles are all same (alpha=beta=gamma=30°), this becomes:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos(30°) - 2hl cos(30°) - 2kl cos(30°) )

So, plugging in the values. The problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure is the lattice parameter for a simple cubic structure. But in a rhombohedral structure, is a the interatomic distance? Or is it the edge length of the unit cell?

Wait, no. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1, but wait, no. Wait, for a simple cubic structure, the atoms are at the corners. The nearest neighbor distance is a√1, because each atom is at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), etc. So the nearest neighbor distance is a in that case. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance might not be the same as the lattice parameter. Wait, but the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this problem, a is the interatomic distance. Or perhaps I'm getting confused between the lattice parameter and the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter a is the same as the interatomic distance. But
