Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. I'm going to take my time and think it out.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me read it again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid that's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, it dissociates more. So first, maybe I should figure out the concentration after dilution.

Wait, so the initial volume is 20 cm³, and then we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid would be volume (in liters) multiplied by molarity. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles divided by total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Wait, but I should calculate the moles at that point.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. Equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed would be equal to moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate.

But wait, I need the pH at equivalence point and at 25% titration.

Wait, let's tackle each part.

First, the 25% titration. 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH used so far is 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

So the reaction will convert 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 mol. After reaction, moles of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- produced is 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but the volume? Because when we add NaOH, the solution's volume increases. But since it's 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. Since the equivalence point requires 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³.

So total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³. Or wait, wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Then each NaOH addition is added to that.

Wait, but when you do a titration, you add the NaOH to the solution, which was 40 cm³. So when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³.

So concentrations:

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

So this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log ( [A^-] / [HA] )

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ approximately 4.73, but let me calculate it precisely.

Wait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. So the log of 1.85 is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) ) 

Let me compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26.

That's one part.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

So, the concentration of acetate comes from the moles of acetate (0.001 mol) and the volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³) → total 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1/1.85e5 ) * 1e-14+5? Wait, no: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So, Kb is 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^- ]

Assuming that the change x is small compared to initial concentration, the expression simplifies.

Initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let x be the [OH^-] produced.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] = x

So Kb ≈ (x^2) / 0.02 = 5.405e-10

So x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6 ) ≈ ?

Log(3.288) is about 0.5165. So log(3.288e-6) is 0.5165 -6 → -5.4835. So pOH is 5.4835.

pH = 14 - pOH → 14 -5.4835 = 8.5165 → approximately 8.52.

Wait, but wait a minute. That can't be right. Because acetate is a weak base, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, Kb is 5.405e-10.

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 0.02 * 5.405e-10 is 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04, so 1.04e-5.5? Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. Hmm, 1e-5.5 is about 3.16e-6. So 1.04e-5.5 is 3.28e-6, which is what I had before.

So pOH is about 5.48, pH is about 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. That matches what I just calculated for the equivalence point.

Wait, but wait another thing. When you have a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution should be basic. So a pH higher than 7, which matches 8.52.

But looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which seems to match. But wait, let me check the 25% titration again.

Wait, I calculated the pH at 25% as approximately 4.26, which is option A or D.

Wait, let me double-check the 25% part.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added are 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ (since 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 → 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 → 0.005882 M.

So applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is about 4.733.

[A^-] is 0.005882, [HA] is 0.017647. Ratio is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ) = 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 → 4.256, which is approximately 4.26.

So, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence point is 8.52. Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 4.26; 8.52.

Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake. Another thing to think about: when you dilute, the acetic acid becomes weaker, but then after adding some NaOH, the buffer region comes into play.

Wait, but another approach could be to calculate the concentrations more accurately. Let me recheck the moles.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol.

After dilution with 20 cm³, total volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So, moles of CH3COOH: 0.00075; moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.00025/0.00075 * (0.04/0.0425? Wait, wait, no. Because when you dilute, the ratio is (moles of A^-)/(moles of HA) which is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3, regardless of the volume, because volume cancels out. Because both are in the same solution, same volume.

Wait, right. Because [A^-]/[HA] is (moles A^- / V) / (moles HA / V) → (moles A^-)/(moles HA). So the volume doesn't affect the ratio. Oh! So I could have just used the ratio of moles, which is 1/3. So, the log(1/3) is -0.477.

So pH is pKa (4.733) minus 0.477 → about 4.256, which is 4.26. So that's correct.

So, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence point, 8.52. So option A.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Option D) 4.57; 6.92

So in the options, A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches what I calculated.

Wait, but why is option D) 4.57; 6.92. Maybe I did a mistake in the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach. At equivalence point, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration is 0.001 mol in 50 cm³ (40 +10).

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

I calculated Kb as 5.405e-10. Let me redo the calculation.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

I can set up the ICE table.

Initial:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M
[CH3COOH] = 0
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
- x → [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x
+ x → [CH3COOH] = x
+ x → [OH^-] = x

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ (x^2)/0.02 =5.405e-10.

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 → [OH^-] =3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → let me compute that accurately.

Log(3.288) is approximately 0.5165. So log(3.288e-6) is 0.5165 -6 → -5.4835. So pOH is 5.4835. pH is 14 -5.4835=8.5165, which rounds to 8.52.

So that's correct.

But again, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused because the initial acetic acid is 0.05 M, and when you dilute it with equal volume, the concentration becomes 0.025 M. So the initial pH before any titration is lower than 4.73 (the pKa). Because for a 0.025 M solution of CH3COOH, the pH is less than pKa.

But that's not directly relevant here. The question is about 25% titration and equivalence point.

So, based on this, the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, giving 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralization converts 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to acetate ions. The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text
