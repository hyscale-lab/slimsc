Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, which I think might mean that the solution conditions are such that the EDTA is in its correct form to complex with Ca²+ ions. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5×10^10.

Hmm. Right, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so each complex would consist of one Ca²+ ion and one EDTA^4- ion (since EDTA is usually in the deprotonated form when it complexes metals).

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, assuming that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be what we're after. But wait, no, because the formation constant tells us about the tendency to form the complex. So, if the solution is in equilibrium, some of the complex might dissociate, releasing Ca²+ ions.

Wait, no, the complex is given as 0.02 M, so the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But in the solution, some of that might dissociate. So the equilibrium would involve the complex dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the formation constant K is given as 5×10^10. I think the formation constant is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this scenario, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is the total concentration of CaEDTA^2-? Or is it the concentration of the complex before dissociation?

Wait, perhaps the 0.02 M is the concentration of the complex, assuming that it's formed completely. But in reality, some might dissociate. So we need to calculate the concentration of free Ca²+.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the solution is at equilibrium, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and from that, we can find the concentration of free Ca²+.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some concepts. Let me get this straight. When you have a complex ion in solution, its concentration is given, and you can use the formation constant to find the concentration of the individual ions.

So the formation constant K is given by K = [complex]/([metal][ligand]). In this case, the complex is CaEDTA^2-.

So the reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is 5×10^10.

Now, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote this as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

But in solution, the complex can dissociate. Let's say that the concentration of free Ca²+ is x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x because each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, wait. Let me model this. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the EDTA^4- would also be x because each complex dissociates into one of each. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M = [CaEDTA^2-].

So plugging into the formation constant formula: K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02/(x²).

We know K is 5×10^10, so:

5×10^10 = 0.02 / x²

So solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5×10^10) = (2×10^-2)/(5×10^10) )= 4×10^-13 / 10? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 equals 4e-13?

Wait, no: 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * (1e-2 / 1e10) ) = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, let's compute it more accurately. 1e-13 is (1e-7)^2, so sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*1e-6.5. Since sqrt(4) is 2, and 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the concentration of Ca²+.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I got the setup right. The K expression is [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]). So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are each x, then K = 0.02/(x^2). That's correct.

So the calculations hold. So the concentration of Ca²+ would be sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions (\([Ca^{2+}]\)) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant (\(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}\)) and the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, the total concentration of the complex is given as \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Assuming the solution is at equilibrium, the concentrations of free \(Ca^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions are equal, denoted as \(x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Approximating \(10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7}\):

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(Ca^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.
