Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get tricky. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³.

Wait, wait. When you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? Because concentration is moles per liter. So the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is finding the pH at 25% titration. The second part is the equivalence point pH.

Let's tackle 25% titration first.

At 25% titration, we've added 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach equivalence, and then take 25% of that.

The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 mol. Since each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Let me think about the reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (OH-) to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water.

So, after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH:

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, the reaction will consume 0.00025 mol of acetic acid and produce 0.00025 mol of acetate.

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

Moles after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol acetic acid remaining.

Moles of acetate produced: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume now is 40 cm³ (original) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH added) = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Hmm, this looks like a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, what's pKa? Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 5. So pKa is 4.745 (since 1e-5 is 5, so 1.85e-5 is about 4.745).

Wait, wait. Let me compute it accurately. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.733.

So pKa ≈ 4.733.

Now, [A^-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the first value would be 4.26.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I sometimes make mistakes. Let's compute the ratio again.

0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = (0.25e-3) / (42.5e-3) ) = 0.25/42.5 = 0.005882 M.

And 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = approx (0.005882 * 1000)/(0.017647 * 1000) = 5.882/17.647 ≈ 0.3333, which is 1/3.

So log(1/3) is indeed about -0.477, so pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So the first value is 4.26, which corresponds to option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options. Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Let me look at the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point: Let's find the moles.

Total moles of acetate at equivalence: 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid is converted to acetate).

The total volume of solution is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ (equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

We can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.29e-6 → pOH = log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514.

So the equivalence point pH is about 8.51. Looking at the options, option A gives 8.52, which is very close. So for the equivalence point, it's about 8.52.

Wait, but wait. Wait, when I calculate Kb, I have Kw = 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. So yes, correct.

So for the equivalence point, the pH is about 8.51. So the two values are 4.26 and 8.51.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52 → seems correct.

Option D) 4.57; 6.92 → no, the equivalence is higher.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the initial dilution calculation?

Wait, original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Adding 20 cm³ of water gives 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Which neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, making 0.00075 mol of acetic acid and 0.00025 mol of acetate. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Alternatively, perhaps using the half-equivalence point? No, because 25% is a quarter of the way, but wait, 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, another thought: Could the 25% be based on the volume of the solution after dilution? No, because the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% of that is 2.5 cm³, which is the same as I did.

So, the first part is correct, 4.26.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the dilution again. Because when you titrate, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. The 25% titration refers to the volume of NaOH added being 25% of the equivalence volume.

So, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 2.5 cm³ is 25%. So that part is correct.

So, the first pH is 4.26, the second is ~8.51. So option A matches.

Wait, but the options have another option, option D, which is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Could I have made a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH at 25% using another method. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that 25% titration is 25% of the initial acetic acid neutralized, but no, the titration is based on the equivalence point. So the approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the buffer calculation again.

The Henderson equation gives pH = pKa + log (nA-/nHA).

Since the solution is 0.0425 L, the moles are:

nHA = 0.00075, nA- = 0.00025.

So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 ≈ 4.26.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, another thing: When calculating the equivalence point pH, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion is 0.02 M, as I did, but maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10.

So yes, correct.

Setting up the equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Let x be the [OH^-] produced.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02).

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485 → pH = 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515, which rounds to 8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.

So the two values are 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but the options don't include all, but let me check the options again.

Option A) 4.26; 8.52 → yes.

Option D) 4.57; 6.92 → no.

Wait, but let me make sure about the buffer calculation again.

Another approach: Using the Henderson equation, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, 1.85e-5 is 0.0000185. So 1/0.0000185 is approximately 54054.05.

Wait, no, wait: 1.85e-5 is 0.0000185. So 1/0.0000185 is approximately 54054.05. So log(54054) is what?

log(54054) is log(5.4054e4) = log(5.4054) + 4 ≈ 0.733 +4 =4.733.

So pKa is 4.733.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 1/3, as before.

Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is 4.26.

So correct.

So the first answer is 4.26, the second is 8.52.

Looking at the options, only option A matches this.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the other options to see if any could make sense.

Option D says 4.57 and 6.92, which seems way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution? Let me double-check.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid: moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001/0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol becomes acetate. Volume is 40 +10=50 cm³, so 0.001/0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So no mistake there.

Wait, another thing: When calculating the pH at 25% titration, maybe I should use the exact concentrations without assuming x is negligible.

Wait, in the buffer solution calculation, I assumed that the change in concentration of acetate and acetic acid is negligible compared to their initial concentrations. But perhaps I should set up the ICE table properly.

Let me try that.

At 25% titration:

Moles of acetic acid: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Volume is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) = 4.733 + log(0.3333).

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256.

No, the same result. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something else, but that's beyond the scope of this problem, I think. So the calculation should be correct.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D has a pH of 4.57 and 6.92. How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution step.

Wait, another approach: Could the initial dilution be done incorrectly?

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water gives 40 cm³. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: What if when titrating, the volume is considered as the original 40 cm³ plus the NaOH volume.

Wait, but yes, I accounted for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the equivalence point pH.

Wait, another approach: At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Let me compute the pH again.

The acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. So the Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So,

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced.

So,

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486 → pH = 14 -5.486 =8.514, which is around 8.51.

So the equivalence pH is ~8.52, as I thought.

So the only option that matches is A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Another approach for the equivalence point: Maybe using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The pH can be calculated using pH = pKa2 + log (sqrt(Kb * C)).

Wait, no, wait. For a weak base like acetate, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKb + 0.5 * log C) / 2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to just proceed with the Kb approach as before.

Hmm, but I think my initial approach was correct.

So, the conclusion is that option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid, which contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The total moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. Since 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.3333).
\]

\(\log(0.3333) \approx -0.477\), so:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 5.405 \times 10^{-10} = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
