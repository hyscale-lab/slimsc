Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values for operators can be found using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. Since the operator here is a combination of σz and σx, I think I can compute the expectation value for each part separately and then add them.

First, let me write down the state vector. The state is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, I should check if this is normalized. Let's compute the modulus squared: |0.5|^2 + |sqrt(3)/2|^2. 0.25 + (3/4) equals 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, σz is the Pauli z-matrix, right? Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So, the expectation value of σz is just the sum of the probabilities times their eigenvalues.

Wait, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ would be (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that. (0.25)(1) + (3/4)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

But the operator in the problem is 10σz, so the expectation value for that part would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, what about σx? The operator σx is the Pauli x-matrix. I remember that σx has eigenstates which are the same as the eigenstates of σz but rotated by 90 degrees. Or wait, no—wait, σx's eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So maybe I can't directly compute it using the same approach as σz.

Alternatively, I can express σx in terms of its matrix and compute the expectation value. The Pauli matrices are:

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So, for a given state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is |a|^2 * ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute using the matrix representation and the state vector.

The state vector is ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Because |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]^T.

So, the expectation value of σx is ψ† σx ψ. Let's compute that.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when we multiply:

ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiplying ψ† σx gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, multiply by ψ:

= (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )
= (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

So the expectation value of σx is 0.866..., which is about 0.866. Since the operator is 5σx, the expectation value for that part is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding the two parts together: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) + (4.33) = -0.67.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation for σx. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication.

Let me compute ψ† σx ψ again.

ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so ψ† σx is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, ψ† σx ψ is (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So yes, that's correct.

So 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) is (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈4.33, yes.

So the total expectation value is -5 +4.33= -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about whether I did the calculation correctly. Because when I compute ⟨σx⟩, sometimes I get confused whether to take the Hermitian conjugate correctly.

Another approach: The expectation value is given by ψ† (10σz +5σx) ψ. Let's compute each term.

Compute 10⟨σz⟩: as before, it's -5.

Compute 5⟨σx⟩: as before, 5*(sqrt(3)/2)≈4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33≈-0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

So yes, the answer is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \), which can be broken into two parts: \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle \) and \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2(+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2(-1) = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]
Thus, the contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]
The state \( \psi \) is written as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]
First, compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \):
\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Then, multiply by \( \psi \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(0.5) + 0.5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866
\]
Thus, the contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]
Rounded to one decimal place, this gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.
