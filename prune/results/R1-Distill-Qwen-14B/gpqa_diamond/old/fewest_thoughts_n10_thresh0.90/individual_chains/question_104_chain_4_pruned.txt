Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards or away from us.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both orbits are circular. So, same star masses, same planet masses, different Doppler shifts.

Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms (I think that's 5e-3 angstroms), and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, orbital period. So, the period of the planet's orbit around the star. The RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period. I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas here.

I remember that the radial velocity (v) of the star is related to the mass of the planet (M) and the orbital period (P). The formula might involve Kepler's third law, maybe.

Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), but for a binary system, I think the formula involves the masses of both bodies. Wait, but in this case, the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, so I can probably neglect the planet's mass compared to the star's. So the formula simplifies.

The formula for the period is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. But how does that relate to the radial velocity?

Oh right, the radial velocity (v) of the star is given by v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*(1 + M_p/M_*))^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity (the maximum velocity) is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P * (1 + M_p/M_*)) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period.

I think the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

Because the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

The formula for the semi-amplitude of radial velocity K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( a^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for a simpler proportionality. Since both stars have the same mass (M_*), and the planets have the same mass (M_p), but different K values, we can relate their periods based on K.

The formula I recall is K = (v) = ( (M_p / M_*) )^(1/3) * ( (G * P )/( 2π ) )^(-1/3) ) * ( sin i )

But wait, since the orbital periods are different, and sin i is probably similar (assuming same inclination, but the question doesn't specify, but since the same method is used, perhaps we can assume same i for both. Or maybe the question is designed so that sin i is the same, so we can ignore it. Or perhaps the question is considering i = 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. But maybe it's a factor we can ignore for the ratio.

Wait, the question says the RV method detected the planets, so the inclination must be such that we can detect the Doppler shift. But since both are Neptune masses, and the same method is used, perhaps we can assume same inclination or that it's accounted for in the K values. So, let's proceed.

So, given that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about how K relates to P.

From Kepler's third law, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the masses.

P² = (4π² G^-1) * (a³) / (M_* + M_p)

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate P² ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_* )

So, a³ = (G M_* P²) / (4π² )

But velocity of the star (v) in radial velocity is related to the size of the orbit.

Wait, the star's velocity is given by v = (2π a) / P.

Wait, that's the velocity of the star in its orbit around the center of mass, right? Because the star's orbit is a small circle, and the planet's is a larger one. But since M_* >> M_p, the star's orbit radius is roughly a_* = (M_p / M_*) * a.

So a_* = (M_p / M_*) * a.

Then, the star's orbital velocity is v = 2π a_* / P = 2π (M_p a) / (M_* P )

But from Kepler's third law, a³ = G M_* P²/(4π² )

So, a = [ G M_* P²/(4π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting back into v:

v = 2π (M_p / M_*) [ ( G M_* P²/(4π²) )^(1/3 ) ] / P

Simplify this:

v = (2π M_p / M_* ) * ( (G M_* P²/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ) ) / P

Factor out P² as P^(2/3), and P as P^1.

So, the term becomes P^(2/3 - 1) ) = P^(-1/3)

So, v = (2 π M_p / M_* ) * ( G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(-1/3) ) ) * (4 π² )^(-1/3) )

Let me simplify the constants:

(2 π) * (4 π² )^(-1/3) = 2 π / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3)) )

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to
