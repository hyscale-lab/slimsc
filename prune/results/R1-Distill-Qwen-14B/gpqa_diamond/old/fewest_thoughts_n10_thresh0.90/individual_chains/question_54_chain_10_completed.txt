Okay, I've got this question about ring-closing metathesis, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So the question is asking for the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene using ring-closing metathesis. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that ring-closing metathesis is a reaction that forms a ring by breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. It's typically catalyzed by transition metals like ruthenium or rhodium. The process involves the exchange of substituents between two alkenes. So, the starting material must have two alkenes that can undergo metathesis to form a ring.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let's draw the structure of the target to visualize it better. Cyclohexene with a double bond between C1 and C2 (assuming numbering starts at the double bond). At position 3 and 4, there are methyl groups. At position 5, there's an isopropyl group.

So the cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 3,4,5. The substituents are two methyl groups (3 and 4) and an isopropyl group at 5.

Now, thinking about the starting material. The metathesis reaction would involve two alkenes in the starting material. When the metathesis occurs, the alkenes would connect, forming the cyclohexene ring.

In ring-closing metathesis, two alkenes are brought together. The catalyst breaks the double bonds and swaps the substituents. So, the starting material would have two double bonds. Alternatively, sometimes the starting material has a diene, which can cyclize.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the structure. The target molecule has a six-membered ring (cyclohexene). The substituents (methyl, isopropyl) are on carbons 3,4,5.

For ring-closing metathesis, the starting material would likely be a diene or two separated alkenes connected by a chain. When the metathesis occurs, the ends of these alkenes would form the ring.

Let's consider the possible starting structures. The target has substituents on carbons 3,4,5. The starting material would have these substituents on a longer chain with two double bonds.

Wait, the target is a cyclohexene. So, the starting material must be an octadiene. Because when you form a six-membered ring, the chain length would need to be such that when the two ends meet, the ring is formed. Let me think: if the starting material is an octadiene, the ring would have 6 atoms, so the chain would have 6 carbons, but the double bonds are at positions that allow the ring to form.

But maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is an alkene with substituents such that when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene (two double bonds) or a monoene with substituents that can be positioned correctly.

Wait, the product is a cyclohexene. So, the starting material must have two alkenes that, when connected, form the six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about the positions. The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, position 5 has isopropyl, and the double bond is between 1 and 2.

So, the cyclohexene ring has substituents on carbons 3,4,5. The starting material must have these substituents in such a way that when the ring is formed, their positions are correct.

Let's imagine the starting material as a diene. Let's say it's an octadiene with substituents in specific positions.

Wait, the product is a cyclohexene, meaning the ring is six-membered. So, the starting material must have a diene that can cyclize to form a six-membered ring. So, the diene would be in a position where the two ends are separated by four carbons (because 1 and 2 are the double bond, so 5,4,3,2,1, etc. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the chain and where the double bonds are.

Alternatively, I'll try to approach it by considering the structure of the starting material.

Suppose the starting material is an octadiene. Let's say the diene is in positions 1,7, meaning it's a 1,7-diene in an 8-carbon chain. But when the ring forms, the chain would need to form a six-membered ring. So, let's think: the chain is long enough, but the positions of the substituents matter.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material would have the substituents in positions that, when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the substituents end up on the correct carbons.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about the positions of the substituents in the starting material.

The target has substituents on carbons 3,4,5. So, these substituents must be present on the same chain in the starting material, in positions that will end up being adjacent when the ring forms.

Wait, in the starting material, the substituents (methyl and isopropyl) are on the same carbon chain. When the ring forms, the positions shift.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diene with substituents in the correct positions so that when the metathesis occurs, the substituents end up on the same ring at the correct positions.

Wait, let's think about how the ring forms. In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes (each with a substituent) are connected. Let's say the starting material has two alkenes separated by a certain number of carbons. When the metathesis occurs, the ends come together to form the ring.

For example, if the starting material is a diene with substituents in positions that, upon ring formation, become the substituents on the ring.

Suppose the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene (option A). So, octa-1,7-diene: the two double bonds are at the ends of an 8-carbon chain. The substituents are in positions 3,4,5 (so, in the middle of the chain). When the metathesis occurs, the ends (the 1 and 7 positions) would form the double bond in the ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexene, a six-membered ring. So the starting material must have two alkenes separated by four carbons (since 6-membered ring implies that the two alkenes are four carbons apart). For example, in an octadiene, the two double bonds would be at 1 and 5, but that's not one of the options. Wait, perhaps I should count the number of carbons between the two double bonds.

Wait, the target has six carbons in the ring. So the starting material must have a chain that, when the alkenes are connected, forms the six-membered ring. So, the number of carbons in the chain between the two alkenes would be four (since 6 - 2 =4). So, if the starting material is, say, an octadiene, the positions of the double bonds would determine the ring size.

Wait, perhaps the double bonds in the starting material are such that the distance between them allows the ring to form with six members. Let's think: if the starting material is an 8-carbon diene, the two double bonds would be at positions that are four carbons apart when the ring forms.

Wait, the positions of the double bonds in the starting material would need to be such that when they undergo metathesis, the chain forms a six-membered ring. So, the starting material would have a 1,5-diene in an 8-carbon chain? Or wait, perhaps I should model it.

Another approach: the starting material has two alkenes, each with substituents. Upon metathesis, these alkenes are connected, and the substituents are positioned on the ring.

Let's think about the substituents. The target has 3 and 4 as methyl groups, 5 as isopropyl. So, in the starting material, these substituents must be on the same chain, positioned such that when the ring forms, they are on adjacent carbons in the ring.

Alternatively, the substituents are already in the positions that, once the ring is formed, they're on the correct carbons.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acyclic diene with substituents in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up in the correct positions.

Let me try to imagine how the starting material would look. Suppose it's a diene. Let's say the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene (option B). Hmm, octa-2,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 2 and 6. That leaves four single bonds between them. So, when metathesis occurs, the ends (2 and 6) would form the ring.

Wait, but wait, in metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bonds and swaps substituents. So, the diene would have two double bonds, perhaps. Or maybe the starting material has two separate alkenes, each with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene with substituents such that when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the substituents end up on the ring.

Another thought: in ring-closing olefin metathesis, the two alkenes that undergo the reaction are at opposite ends of the chain. So, the starting material would have double bonds at the ends, and substituents in the middle.

So, for example, the starting material might be an octa-1,8-diene, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the double bonds are at 1 and 7, making an octa-1,7-diene. But let's check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Option B: same substituents, octa-2,6-diene.

Hmm. Let's think about the positions. If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, that's a diene at the ends of an 8-carbon chain. The substituents (isopropyl at 5, methyl at 3 and 4) would be in the middle.

When the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (at 1 and 7) would form a ring by connecting the ends. So, the 1 and 7 positions would form the new double bond in the ring.

Wait, but octa-1,7-diene has two double bonds at the ends of the chain. Wait, no—octa-1,7-diene would have 8 carbons with double bonds between 1-2 and 7-8, I think. No, wait, in an octadiene, the positions are 1-2 and 7-8. So, the chain is like CH2=CH-...-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at C1-C2 and C7-C8. So, that's two double bonds at the ends of the chain.

But how would that form a ring upon metathesis? Because metathesis typically involves two alkenes, so perhaps the two ends of the chain would form the ring.

Wait, but for ring-closing, the two alkenes need to be at the ends of the chain. So, in octa-1,7-diene, the two alkenes are at 1-2 and 7-8. So, the distance between the alkenes is 7-1=6 carbons. Wait, no, chain length: if the chain is 8 carbons, the positions are 1-2 and 7-8. So, the two alkenes are at opposite ends, separated by 5 single bonds (since 7-1=6, which is between 1 and 7, but with 6 bonds in between? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the chain is eight carbons long. So, positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

The double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. So, between the two double bonds, there's positions 3,4,5,6. That's four single bonds between the two double bonds.

So when the metathesis occurs, the two alkenes (ends) would form a ring, with the substituents in the middle.

But the target is a six-membered ring. So, perhaps the starting material's chain is such that when the two ends connect, the ring has six members, which requires that the chain between the two alkenes is four carbons long. Wait, because each of the alkenes is two carbons (each double bond is between two carbons), so perhaps the number of single bonds between the two alkenes should be four to make a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me think: a six-membered ring would have each end of the chain connected after four carbons. Because each end contributes two carbons (the double bond), and the four in between would make 2+4+2=8? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps if the starting material has two alkenes separated by four single bonds, the ring formed would have six members.

Wait, if the starting material has two alkenes separated by four single bonds (so the positions are 1 and 6 in an 8-carbon chain), then the ring formed would have six members. Because the two ends (each from the alkenes) would bridge the four carbons in between.

So, the starting material would have two alkenes at positions 1 and 6 (octa-1,6-diene), but looking at the options, option C is octa-1,6-diene, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethyl.

Wait, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5 in the octene.

When the ring forms, the two alkenes at 1 and 6 would come together. Let's imagine:

Structure of octa-1,6-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, octa is 8 carbons. Wait, octa-1,6-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, perhaps it's 1,6 in an 8-carbon chain. So positions 1-2 and 6-7 are double bonds.

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7. So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

So, the chain is:

1-2 (double bond)
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2
Then 6-7 (double bond)
CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait no, perhaps it's better to write it as:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, that's only eight carbons if the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. Then, when metathesis occurs, the two ends (1 and 6) would form the ring.

Wait, but in that case, the ring would have 6 members, because the chain from 1 to 6 is six carbons (1,2,3,4,5,6). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has two alkenes at positions that, when connected, form a six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. So, in the starting material, these substituents must be on the same positions, but in a linear chain.

So, for example, if the starting material is 3,4-dimethyl-5-isopropyl-octa-1,6-diene, upon metathesis, the ends (1 and 6) would form the ring, and the substituents would end up at positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

But wait, in the starting material, the substituents are on the middle of the chain, so when the ring forms, they would be in the middle of the ring.

Let me try to imagine the starting material as octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So, structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the correct positions to end up on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Because, in this case, the double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. So, the chain is:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach is to think about the positions of the substituents and the double bonds.

The target molecule has substituents at 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, these substituents must be in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up on the ring at those positions.

So, if the starting material is an octa-2,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5, then when the ring forms, the substituents would be in the correct positions.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is octa-2,6-diene. So, the double bonds are between 2-3 and 6-7. The chain has substituents at 3,4,5.

When the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (2-3 and 6-7) would form a ring. So, the ends of the chain would connect: the 2 and 6 would form the ring.

Wait, but then the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle of the ring. So, the ring would have substituents at positions 3,4,5, which matches the target.

Alternatively, the starting material would have the substituents in positions that, when the ring is formed, they are in the correct positions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to think about the number of carbons between the substituents.

In the target, the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5 of the six-membered ring. So, when the starting material is a diene, the substituents are in the middle of the chain.

The starting material must have a structure where, when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the substituents (3,4,5) become part of the ring at the correct positions.

Wait, let me think of the starting material as a diene with substituents in the middle. Suppose the starting material is octa-1,7-diene with substituents at 3,4,5.

When the metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) would form the ring, and the substituents would end up on carbons 3,4,5 of the ring.

So, the target cyclohexene would have substituents at 3,4,5, which matches.

Therefore, the starting material for option A is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Wait, but octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8, so when the ring forms, it would form a 7-membered ring? That can't be right because the product is a six-membered ring.

Wait, no, wait. No, the starting material is an 8-carbon diene, which would form a six-membered ring upon closing. How? Because the chain between the two double bonds must be four carbons long.

So, starting material has a diene at positions 1 and 5 (octa-1,5-diene), but that's not an option.

Wait, another way: the number of carbons between the two alkenes in the starting material must be four, so that when they close, the ring has 6 members.

So, the starting material is an 8-carbon chain with two alkenes. The two alkenes are separated by four single bonds, which would make the ring six-membered.

So, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, separated by four carbons (positions 2,3,4,5), then when they undergo metathesis, the ring formed would have six members.

Wait, octa-1,6-diene: double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. The chain is 8 carbons. The substituents are at 3,4,5. So, when the ring forms, the substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 of the six-membered ring.

So, the starting material would be option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Because option C is option C: octa-1,6-diene.

Wait, but option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So, in the starting material, the substituents are at 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at 1,6.

So, when metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 6) form the ring, which becomes six-membered, with substituents in the correct positions.

That makes sense. So, the starting material is C.

Wait, let me double-check. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

The starting material is octa-1,6-diene with substituents 3,4,5.

So, during metathesis, the two alkenes at 1 and 6 would form the new double bond in the ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would remain as they are, ending up as substituents on the ring.

Thus, the correct starting material is option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the structure of the target molecule and the nature of the reaction. The target molecule is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). 

Ring-closing metathesis involves the exchange of substituents between two alkenes in a chain to form a ring. The starting material must therefore be a diene with substituents positioned such that, upon metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene ring.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 7 of an 8-carbon chain, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. However, the distance between the double bonds (separated by five single bonds) would result in a seven-membered ring, not the desired six-membered ring. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 2 and 6 of an 8-carbon chain, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. The distance between the double bonds (separated by three single bonds) would result in a five-membered ring, not the desired six-membered ring. Thus, this option is also incorrect.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 6 of an 8-carbon chain, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. The distance between the double bonds (separated by four single bonds) is ideal for forming a six-membered ring. During metathesis, the double bonds at positions 1 and 6 would react to form the cyclohexene ring, with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 remaining in their respective positions. This matches the structure of the target molecule. Thus, this option is correct.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 7 of an 8-carbon chain, but the substituents are at positions 4, 5, and 6. The substituents would not align correctly with the target molecule's structure after metathesis. Additionally, the double bonds are too far apart to form a six-membered ring. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to form the desired six-membered ring via ring-closing metathesis.

Answer: C
