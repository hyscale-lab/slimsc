Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. Wait, maybe drawing it would help. So, each CH3 group is attached to a carbon that's double-bonded to another carbon. There's a chain in the middle with single bonds. I think it's a molecule with two double bonds. Let me count the carbons. Each end has a (CH3)2C=CH-, so that's four carbons on each end maybe? Or perhaps it's a longer chain with two double bonds. Hmm, maybe I don't need to get into the exact structure for calculating the enthalpy of formation.

The question gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. And some bond energies: H-H is 100, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. So I remember that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using bond energies. The formula is: 

Enthalpy of formation = [sum of bond energies of all bonds broken] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds formed]

Wait, actually, no. Let me think. The standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the bond energies. For the molecule, we consider the bonds formed and broken. But maybe I should think in terms of the formation from elements.

So the enthalpy of formation of a compound is the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon, it's formed from carbon and hydrogen. So if I can figure out how many C-C, C-H, and other bonds are in the molecule, I can calculate the enthalpy.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives me the bond energies, so I can use them to compute the enthalpy of formation. But I also have the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, because in the formation reaction, carbon atoms are in the form of CO2 or something else? Wait, no, the standard state for carbon is graphite, I think. But I'm a bit confused. Or maybe the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a carbon into individual atoms. So, when forming the molecule from elements, you have to atomize the carbon and hydrogen.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Break down the elements into their constituent atoms (atomization).
2. Form the molecule from those atoms.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The general formula is:

ΔHf° (product) = [Σ ΔH of bonds broken in reactants] - [Σ ΔH of bonds formed in product]

Alternatively, for the formation from elements, you have to consider the bonds broken in the reactants (elements) and bonds formed in the product.
