Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The astronomers are observing it and notice brightness variations because the spots are causing the star to dim as it rotates. But wait, the interesting part is that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the same kind of signal in the light curve. The question is asking: what should be the radius of an exoplanet (Rpl) relative to the star's radius (Rstar) to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots are causing?

Hmm. I think I need to compare the brightness changes caused by the spots to those caused by a planet transiting the star. Because when a planet transits, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the spots would cause a dip as they rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, more or less of the spots come into view, causing the brightness to vary. So the effect is similar to a planet transiting, but it's a different phenomenon.

The question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So I need to calculate the relative change in brightness for both scenarios and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius relative to the star.

Let me think about each scenario.

First, the star with spots. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. The filling factor is 20%, so that's 0.2. But wait, the star is a sphere, so the hemisphere with spots has an area of (1/2) * 4πR² = 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) ) = 0.4/4 = 0.1, so 10% coverage. But wait, the question says the hemisphere is covered with a 20% filling factor. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the fraction of the entire star is 0.1, as I thought.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's only one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spots will be visible as the star's surface area facing us changes. So the maximum effect would be when the entire hemisphere is visible, but that's only when the star is viewed edge-on, perhaps. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fraction of the star's disk that's covered when the spots are on the visible side is 0.
