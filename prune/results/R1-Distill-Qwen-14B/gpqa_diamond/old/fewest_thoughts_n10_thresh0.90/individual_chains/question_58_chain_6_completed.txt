Okay, so I've got this physics question here about which theory doesn't require regularization when dealing with high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question gives me four options: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. Right, so regularization is a way to handle these infinities by introducing a cutoff or some other method, and then you renormalize to get finite results.

Wait, so the question is asking which of these theories never needs regularization. That probably means which one is free from these divergences, or perhaps it has a way around needing regularization.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and it's supposed to be a more complete theory, maybe even finite? Because in string theory, particles are not point-like but are strings, which might make things different. I remember that in superstring theory, the theory is background-dependent and uses supersymmetry, but I'm not sure if it avoids needing regularization. Or maybe it's because string theory incorporates higher-dimensional aspects or some other mechanisms that prevent divergences. But wait, I think that in string theory, perturbative expansions can still have divergences, but maybe they're handled differently, not through traditional regularization and renormalization. Or perhaps string theory doesn't require the same kind of regularization because of the way it's formulated. I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD runs into issues with things like confinement and asymptotic freedom. Wait, but in terms of regularization, I remember that QCD calculations often require things like lattice regularization. Because of the non-abelian nature of the gauge group, perhaps the theory has more severe divergences, so you need to regularize. Also, when dealing with high energies (like in deep inelastic scattering), QCD becomes perturbative, but even then, regularizations are necessary to handle loop integrals and such. So I think QCD does require regularization, which would mean it's not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I definitely remember that QED has issues with divergent loop diagrams. For example, the electron self-energy or the photon vacuum polarization. These lead to infinities, so you need to renormalize. But renormalization comes after regularization. So you first regularize the theory, perhaps using a cutoff, Pauli-Villars, dimensional regularization, etc., then absorb the divergences into counterterms. So QED does require regularization. So option C is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version. Oh, right! In classical electromagnetism, you don't have the same kind of divergences because it's a classical theory without quantum effects. So when you calculate things like the fields around charges, you can get infinities in certain limits, like the electric field of a point charge. But in a classical setting, like in Maxwell's equations, you don't regularize because you're not doing quantum loop calculations. So classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same divergent loop integrals that quantum theories have. 

So putting it all together, the question is which theory never requires regularization. Since regularization is a quantum field theory technique, any classical theory wouldn't need it. So option D, Classical Electrodynamics, is the one that doesn't need regularization. Superstring theory is a quantum theory, so maybe it does require some form of regularization, even if it's different from standard QFT methods. QCD and QED definitely require regularization. So the answer must be D.


To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the given options:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a quantum theory that incorporates strings instead of point particles. While it is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity and may handle divergences differently due to its unique structure, it still involves quantum field theory calculations that require regularization techniques, even if they differ from standard methods.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and involves non-abelian gauge fields. Calculations in QCD, especially at high energies, often require regularization to handle divergences, such as those arising in loop integrals. Techniques like lattice regularization are commonly used in QCD.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the theory of electromagnetism and involves divergent loop diagrams, such as the electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. These divergences necessitate regularization before renormalization can be applied. Thus, QED requires regularization.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics is a non-quantum theory based on Maxwell's equations. It does not involve the divergences or infinities that arise in quantum field theories, such as those requiring regularization. Therefore, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

From this analysis, the only theory that never requires regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
