Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. They're assuming black body radiation, and we need to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Alright, let's start breaking this down. I think the key here is understanding the factors that determine the luminosity of a star. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is Luminosity (L) = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the problem states that both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Wait, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If the peak wavelengths are the same, that means their temperatures are the same. Oh, so T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, but the stars are moving with radial velocities. Radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength might not be the same as the emitted one. Oh, right! So the peak wavelength observed would be different from the actual emitted one because of the Doppler shift.

But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, does that mean that after considering the Doppler shift, both stars' observed peak wavelengths are the same?

Hmm. So let's think about that. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the radial velocity. But wait, wait. Radial velocity can be positive (moving away) or negative (moving towards), so the formula might involve adding or subtracting the velocity.

Alternatively, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity (positive when moving away). So, if Star_1 has v=0, then its observed λ is equal to its emitted λ. For Star_2, with v=700 km/s, we need to compute its observed λ.

Wait, but the problem says the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So, the observed λ_peak for both is the same. Therefore, the emitted λ (from each star's own rest frame) must have been shifted. So let me denote λ1_emit and λ2_emit as the emitted peak wavelengths of Star_1 and Star_2.

Since Star_1 has v=0, λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

Star_2 has v=700 km/s moving away, so λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But the observed wavelengths are the same, so λ1_emit = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, let me think about the Doppler shift again. If the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, longer (red shift). Since Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light?

Wait, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 is about 0.0023 of the speed of light. Maybe we can approximate the Doppler shift factor using non-relativistic terms.

Alternatively, let's compute the Doppler shift factor, perhaps using a Taylor expansion for small velocities. Because 700 km/s is small compared to the speed of light, maybe we can approximate the Doppler shift.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for the wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 )

Wait, but when the source is moving away, the wavelength is redshifted. So in the non-relativistic approximation, the observed wavelength is approximately λ_emit * (1 + v/c). So, for small v, the square terms are negligible.

Alternatively, I think the non-relativistic approximation for Doppler shift is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v/c). Similarly, for the frequency, the shift is f_obs ≈ f_emit (1 - v/c). But I'm not entirely confident about the exact form, but given that v is small, perhaps we can proceed with that.

So, considering that, for Star_2, which is moving away, the observed peak wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c). Star_1 has v1=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

Given that the observed wavelengths are the same: λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ_peak = b / T. So,

λ1_emit = b / T1

λ2_emit = b / T2

So, substituting,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

Rearranging,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c) / [1 + (v2/c) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the temperature ratio. Let me write this as:

T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c ) / (1 )

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, from the equation:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit (1 + v2/c )

But λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2 / T1 = 1 + v2/c

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Wait, but that can't be correct because if a star is moving away, its temperature would appear lower (since the wavelength is longer, so T is lower). Wait, but according to Wien's law, longer λ corresponds to lower T. So, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength is longer, so its T would be lower. But in our equation, T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c ). Since 1 + v2/c is greater than 1, this would imply T2 > T1, which contradicts.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler formula. Let me re-examine the Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c )

So, λ_obs is longer. So, if the star is moving away, the observed λ is longer than emitted.

But in this problem, the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, so:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Which implies that λ1_emit (since Star_1 isn't moving) must be equal to λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c ), so:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c )

But since λ_emit = b / T,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Wait, that can't be right because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer, which implies that it's cooler. But according to this, T2 would be higher than T1, which is the opposite.

Ah, I think I must have swapped the ratio. Let me think again.

Wait, the star moving away emits a longer wavelength when observed. So, the observed λ is longer, implying that the temperature T is lower. So, T_obs = T_emit / (1 + v/c ), perhaps? Or maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the Doppler shift is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z ), where z is the redshift.

And the redshift z is approximately v/c for small velocities.

So, if Star_2 is moving away with velocity v,
