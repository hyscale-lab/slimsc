Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both planets are orbiting the same star, so the star's properties are the same for both. The question gives me a lot of data, so I should start by listing what I know.

The star's parameters are:
- Mass = 1.5 times the Sun (M_s = 1.5 M_sun)
- Radius = 1.2 times the Sun (R_s = 1.2 R_sun)
- Effective Temperature (Teff) = 6300 K

Planets:
Planet1:
- Mass = 7 Earth masses (M1 = 7 M_earth)
- Radius = 1.7 Earth radii (R1 = 1.7 R_earth)
- Induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å.

Planet2:
- Mass = 5 Earth masses (M2 = 5 M_earth)
- Radius = 1.3 Earth radii (R2 = 1.3 R_earth)
- Induces a shift of 0.04 Å in the same line.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh, and the planets have the same albedo, so that factor will cancel out when taking the ratio.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ( (L / L_sun) )^(1/4) wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a_p) )^(1/4) )

Where a_p is the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, this term will be the same for both, so it cancels out in the ratio.

But wait, another approach: The star's luminosity is given by L = 4πR_s²σT_s^4. Then, the flux at the planet's distance is F = L / (4π
