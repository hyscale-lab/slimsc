Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits, right?

So, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. But wait, I'm not sure if mass is relevant here because I think luminosity is more about radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that luminosity L is proportional to R² times T⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So L = 4πσR²T⁴, but since we're dealing with ratios, the constants might cancel out.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, so the peak wavelength λ_max is the same for both stars. I remember Wien's Law, which says λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but then if both have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio would just depend on the radius squared. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So Star_1 is 2.25 times more luminous than Star_2.

But wait, the options have more precise numbers. Like option B is ~2.32, which is close to 2.25. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that factor in?

Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right! If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and moving away causes redshift. But in this case, if Star_1 has 0 velocity, its observed wavelength is at rest. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us or away? Because the problem doesn't specify the direction, just the radial velocity. Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_1 is not moving, Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s. But how does this affect the wavelength?

Wait the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So when the astronomers observed them, their λ_max was the same. But if Star_2 is moving, its light is Doppler shifted. So the observed λ_max might not be the same as the intrinsic λ_max. Oh wait, but the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same. So perhaps the Doppler effect must be considered.

Wait, that complicates things. Let me think. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. Then its light would be blueshifted, so the observed λ_max would be shorter than its intrinsic λ_max. But if Star_1's observed λ_max is the same as Star_2's, then Star_2's intrinsic λ_max must be longer. Wait, but the problem says the observed λ_max are the same. So their intrinsic λ_max must be different? Or wait, no. Let me think this through.

The peak emission wavelength for each star, as per Wien's law, is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if Star_1 and Star_2 have the same observed λ_max, but one of them is moving (Star_2), then their intrinsic temperatures might not be the same. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is the same. So the Doppler effect affects the observed wavelength.

So for Star_2, its actual (intrinsic) λ_max is different from the observed. Let me model this. Let's denote:

λ_observed = λ_intrinsic * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, when a star is moving towards us, v_r is negative, so λ_observed is less than λ_rest. Or wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact sign. Let me think again. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so observed wavelength is shorter than emitted. So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c), but wait, no, the formula is more accurately λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when considering relativistic speeds, but perhaps for non-relativistic speeds, we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c). Wait, no, wait. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity towards the observer. But when v is much less than c, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c). But wait, if the star is moving towards us, v is positive, so λ_obs is smaller than λ_rest.

But in our problem, Star_1 has v=0, so its observed λ_max is equal to its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2 has v=700 km/s. Let me assume it's moving away, but wait, if it's moving away, the observed λ_max would be longer. But in the problem, both observed λ_max are the same. So let's think about what that implies.

Let me denote:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v1=0)

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, v2 is positive, so the denominator decreases, the fraction increases, so λ_obs is longer than λ_rest. But if Star_2 is moving towards us, v2 is negative, so the same formula would give λ_obs shorter than λ_rest.

But in the problem, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So Star_1's λ1_rest must be equal to Star_2's λ2_obs.

Which is λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Wait, but wait, let me get the direction right. If Star_2's velocity is positive (moving away), then the observed λ would be longer. But if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed λ would be shorter.

In the problem, Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But the direction isn't specified. So we have to consider whether it's moving towards or away.

Because, for example, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its observed λ would be blueshifted (shorter λ), so its λ_obs would be smaller than its λ_rest. If Star_1's λ_obs is same as Star_2's, then Star_2's λ_rest must be larger than Star_1's λ_rest.

Wait, maybe I should define:

Let me think again. Luminosity L is proportional to R^2 T^4. The question is to find L1/L2.

But the stars are observed to have the same λ_max. So, considering their intrinsic λ_max (λ1_rest and λ2_rest), and the Doppler shifts.

So the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1_rest (since radial velocity is 0). For Star_2, the observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c), if v is the radial velocity away. Or if v is towards, it would be (1 - v/c), but the sign depends on direction.

Wait, the formula for observed wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c), since the source is approaching, so wavelength decreases. If the source is moving away, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

Wait, but the Doppler shift formula is often written as:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)

where v_r is the radial velocity. If the source is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs > λ_rest. If moving towards, v_r is negative, so λ_obs < λ_rest.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

where v is the recession velocity. So when v is positive (moving away), λ_obs is longer. When v is negative (moving towards), λ_obs is shorter.

But wait, what's the exact formula? Let me think of non-relativistic speeds.

In the non-relativistic limit, the Doppler effect can be approximated as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c )

where v_r is the radial velocity. But the direction matters.

If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is longer. If moving towards, v_r is negative, λ_obs is shorter.

So, in the problem, Star_1 has v=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. But we don't know the direction. Hmm, but the problem says that the observed λ_max are the same for both stars. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

If Star_2 is moving away, then λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c).

If Star_2 is moving towards us, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v/c).

But λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

So, let's consider both possibilities.

Case 1: Star_2 is moving away.

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c )

From Wien's law: λ_max = b / T.

So, λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting into the above equation:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v/c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

Case 2: Star_2 is moving towards us.

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 - v/c )

Same substitution:

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 - v/c )

T1 = T2 / (1 - v/c )

Wait, but which case is it? The problem says Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But it doesn't specify direction. Hmm. So perhaps we have to consider both possibilities? Or maybe there's more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the magnitude, so we can take v as 700 km/s in the formula, but the direction affects the ratio of temperatures.

But since the problem says both stars have the same observed λ_max, perhaps we can model this correctly.

Let me proceed with the Doppler effect.

Given that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same.

So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But since Star_1 isn't moving, λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Star_2 is moving, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, negative for moving towards).

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But according to Wien's law, λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v_r / c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r / c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r / c )

Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then v_r is negative, so (1 + v_r/c) becomes (1 - |v_r|/c ), which would make T1 larger than T2.

But wait, the problem states that both stars have the same observed maximum wavelengths. So, let's calculate T1 and T2 accordingly.

We can plug in the numbers.

v_r = 700 km/s.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.

So, v_r / c = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333...

So, 1 + v_r/c = approx 1.002333.

Now, let's calculate T1 and T2.

From the equation:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So, T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Which is approximately T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 is slightly less than T2.

Wait, but wait, if the star is moving away, the observed λ is longer, which would imply a lower temperature, because λ is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer, which would imply a lower T2, but wait, no. Because, in reality, T2 is the intrinsic temperature. So let's think:

If Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ is longer, which would imply (because of Doppler shift) that the intrinsic λ of Star_2 is shorter. Because when a star moves away, the observed λ is longer than the emitted λ (because the light is redshifted).

Wait, no, no. Let me get this straight. If a star emits a certain wavelength λ_rest, and it's moving away, the observed λ_obs is longer than λ_rest. So, for the same T, λ_obs is longer. But according to Wien's law, a higher T would mean a shorter λ_rest.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me recap.

Star_1's observed λ is λ1_rest, because v=0.

Star_2's observed λ is λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c ), assuming it's moving away.

But the observed λ's are the same, so:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

Which implies:

λ1_rest / λ2_rest = (1 + v2/c )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T, so:

( b / T1 ) / ( b / T2 ) = (1 + v2/c )

Simplify:

T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Which means T2 is larger than T1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c )

In this case, v2 is 700 km/s, so (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 is about 0.233% larger than T1.

So now, we can compute the luminosity ratio.

L is proportional to R^2 T^4.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

But R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (2.25 R2^2 ) T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

The R2^2 cancels out:

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But we know T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c ), which is approx T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * k, where k=1.002333.

So,

T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / (k^4 )

k is 1.002333, so k^4 is approximately (1.002333)^4.

Let me compute 1.002333^4.

We can approximate this using the binomial expansion.

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)x²)/2 + ... for small x.

Here, x = 0.002333, n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3 * (0.002333)^2)/2.

= 1 + 0.009332 + (12 * 0.00000544 ) / 2.

= 1 + 0.009332 + (0.06528 ) / 2.

= 1 + 0.009332 + 0.03264.

= 1.041972.

So approximately 1.041972.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / 1.041972 ≈ 0.9597.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9597 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9597.

Calculating 2.25 * 0.9597:

2 * 0.9597 =1.9194.

0.25 * 0.9597=0.239925.

Total approx 1.9194 + 0.239925 = 2.1593.

Wait, but that would give us about 2.16, but that's not close to the options given, which are around 2.23, 2.25, etc.

Hmm, maybe my approximation isn't precise enough. Let me do a more accurate calculation for (1.002333)^4.

Compute 1.002333^4:

Compute 1.002333^2 first.

1.002333^2 = (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Now, square that result to get to the fourth power.

(1.00467144)^2.

Again using (a + b)^2 ≈ a^2 + 2ab + b².

a=1, b=0.00467144.

So,

= 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.000021824.

= 1.0093647.

So, 1.002333^4 ≈ 1.00936.

Therefore, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1.00936) ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me double-check why I considered Star_2 moving away. What if Star_2 was moving towards us?

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v/c ).

Then, the equation would be:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 - v/c )

Which would give:

T2 = T1 * (1 - v/c )

Since v/c is 0.002333, 1 - v/c is 0.997667.

So, T2 = T1 * 0.997667.

Which means T2 is smaller than T1. Then, let's compute L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Again, R1=1.5 R2, so R1^2/R2^2=2.25.

Now, T2 = T1 * 0.997667.

So,

T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/( (0.997667)^4 )

Compute (0.997667)^4.

Again, using binomial approximation.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x + 6x² -4x³ +x^4, where x=0.002333.

But let's compute it numerically.

0.997667^1=0.997667.

0.997667^2= (approx) (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004666 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 0.995334 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.995339.

Then, 0.995339^2 ≈ (approximating):

= (1 - 0.004661)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004661 + (0.004661)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009322 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.9906997.

So, (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/0.9907 ≈ 1.0094.

Then,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.27085.

Which is approximately 2.27, which is not among the options. The closest option is B) ~2.32, which is higher than this. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction of the velocity. But the problem doesn't specify whether Star_2 is moving towards or away. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. The radial velocity is 700 km/s for Star_2, but the direction isn't given. So perhaps I should use |v_r| in the Doppler formula. So, regardless of direction, the observed λ would be different.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed λ_max for both are the same. So in either case, the ratio would be different. So perhaps the direction makes a difference.

But if Star_2 is moving towards us, then T2 would be lower, leading to a higher L1/L2 ratio, but not matching the options. Earlier, when considering Star_2 moving away, the ratio was about 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I considered Star_2 moving away, and got L1/L2 ≈2.23.

So perhaps the correct scenario is that Star_2 is moving away, and the ratio is ~2.23, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula instead of the non-relativistic approximation. Let's try that.

The exact relativistic formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Again, assuming Star_2 is moving away, v is positive.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

λ1_rest / λ2_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ1_rest = b/T1, λ2_rest = b/T2.

So,

(1/T1) / (1/T2) ) = sqrt( (1+v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

=> T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Compute (1 + v/c) = 1.002333, (1 - v/c)=0.997667.

So,

(1.002333 / 0.997667 ) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.00468.

So, sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00234.

So,

T2/T1 = 1.00234.

Now, L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1=1.5 R2, so R1^2/R2^2=2.25.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.

T1/T2 = 1 / 1.00234 ≈ 0.997668.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997668)^4.

Compute 0.997668^4.

Again, using the approximation:

(1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - nx + (n(n-1)x²)/2 - ... for small x.

x=0.002332, n=4.

So,

(0.997668)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*(0.002332) + (4*3 * (0.002332)^2 )/2.

= 1 - 0.009328 + (12 * 0.000005438 ) / 2.

= 1 - 0.009328 + (0.000065256 ) / 2.

= 1 - 0.009328 + 0.000032628.

= 0.9906046.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9906.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9906 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

So, I think the correct answer is D.


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem provides the following information:

1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).
2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The observed peak wavelengths \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) for both stars are the same. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant, the intrinsic wavelengths \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \) are inversely proportional to the temperatures \( T \).
3. **Radial Velocity**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The Doppler effect shifts the observed wavelength of Star_2, so its intrinsic wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \) must differ from its observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \).

### Step 1: Relating Intrinsic Temperatures
The observed wavelength of Star_2 is Doppler-shifted. Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}},
\]
where \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), we calculate:
\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333.
\]
For Star_2 moving away, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \). Since the observed wavelengths of both stars are the same:
\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}.
\]
From Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \), so:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}.
\]
Substituting \( v/c \approx 0.002333 \):
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx \sqrt{1.00468} \approx 1.00234.
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = 2.25 \), and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.00234 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
\]
Since \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.00234 \), we have:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.00234}.
\]
Approximating \( (1/1.00234)^4 \) using the binomial expansion:
\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (1 - 0.00234)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00234) = 0.9906.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9906 \approx 2.23.
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
