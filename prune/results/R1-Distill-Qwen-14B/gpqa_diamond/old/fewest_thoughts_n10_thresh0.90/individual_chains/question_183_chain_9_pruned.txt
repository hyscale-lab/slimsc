Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, the Wolff-Kishner is when you have a carbonyl group and you reduce it using those reagents. Oh, right, the Wolff-Kishner reduces carbonyl groups (like ketones or aldehydes) to methylene groups, removing the oxygen. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around—no, wait, the Wolff-Kishner is for converting carbonyl groups into methylene groups, so like R-C(=O)-R' becomes R-CH₂-R' after the reaction.

Wait, but the starting molecule has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So the starting compound is 2-formyl-... So when reacted with red phosphorus and HI, which is the Wolff-Kishner conditions, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be converted into a CH₂ group. Let me think about that.

So the structure of the starting material: cyclohexene ring. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?), wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene). Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?), no, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached, so the substituent is a vinyl group—like CH₂=CH-.

So the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 and 5. Now, when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, the formyl group (CHO) will be converted into CH₂. Wait, so the aldehyde group (CHO) becomes CH₂–, so the substituent at position 2 becomes a methyl group?

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. The Wolff-Kishner reaction involves heating a carbonyl compound (like an aldehyde or ketone) with excess of HI and red phosphorus, which typically leads to the formation of a methylene group. So RCHO + HI, P → RCH₂.

So in this case, the formyl group (CHO) is at position 2. After the reaction, it becomes a CH₂ group. So the substituent at position 2 is now CH₂.

But wait, is that the only change? Let me think about the structure again. The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So it's a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group as well. Let me clarify.

The structure: cyclohex-3-ene (so double bond between C3 and C4). At position 2 is a formyl (CHO), at position 5 a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?), no, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. So the substituent at position 5 is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring.

And the carboxylic acid is at the same position as the cyclohexene? Wait, no, the name is 5-vinyl, and the position of the substituents is 2 and 5, with the ring being cyclohex-3-ene. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

So after the Wolff-Kishner reaction, the formyl group becomes CH₂, so position 2 now has a CH₂ group instead of CHO.

But wait, wait a minute, the carboxylic acid group is also present. Does that affect anything? Because carboxylic acids have carbonyl groups as well. But the Wolff-Kishner is usually for ketones and aldehydes. Carboxylic acids are generally not reactive under Wolff-Kishner conditions, right? Because the carbonyl is more electron-deficient in aldehydes and ketones compared to carboxylic acids, which are less reactive. So the carboxylic acid's carbonyl might not react under these conditions.

So the reaction should only affect the aldehyde group. So the substituent at position 2 (CHO) becomes CH₂, and the rest remains. So the product would be 2-(CH₂)-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid. Wait, no, the position 2 substituent was CHO, which becomes CH₂, so now it's a methyl group attached to the ring at position 2.

So the product is 2-methyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid. Now, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of this product.

Hydrogen deficiency index (also known as degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2. But since X and N are zero here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Alternatively, another way to calculate it is to count the number of rings and double bonds. Each ring or double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation.

So, let's look at the product structure. The ring is cyclohexene, which has a double bond—so that's one degree. Plus, there are substituents that might add more.

Wait, the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group, which is CH₂=CH–. So that's another double bond. So that's two degrees so far.

The substituent at position 2 is a methyl group, which doesn't have any double bonds or rings, so it doesn't add any.

The carboxylic acid group is -COOH. The carbonyl group is a double bond, which is another degree. So that brings it to three.

Wait, but wait, the starting material's carboxylic acid group was also present. So the product has the same carboxylic acid group. So that's another double bond.

So let me count all the double bonds and rings.

1. The cyclohexene ring: one double bond (so one degree).
2. The vinyl substituent (position 5): another double bond (second degree).
3. The carboxylic acid group: another double bond (third degree).

So the total degrees of unsaturation would be 3.

Wait, but let me recheck the formula. The formula for the product would be helpful. Let's think about the molecular formula of the product.

Original compound: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Assuming the formula is C9H8O2 (maybe? Let me think: cyclohexene is C6H10. Then substituents: formyl is CHO (which is C:1, H:1, O:1), vinyl is CH2=CH- (so C:2, H:3), and the carboxylic acid is COOH (C:1, O:2, H:2). Wait, so cyclohexene has 6 carbons, plus formyl (1 C, so 7), vinyl (2 C, so 9), and COOH (1 C, but already accounted for in the cyclohexene). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the degrees of unsaturation based on the structure.

Wait, but the product after reaction has the same carboxylic acid group and cyclohexene ring, plus the substituents.

So the product is 2-methyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- The cyclohexene ring: one double bond (so 1)
- The vinyl group: another double bond (so 2)
- The carboxylic acid: another double bond (so 3)
- Are there any rings? The cyclohexene is a ring, which counts as one.

Wait no, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So the ring itself counts as one degree, and the double bond within the ring adds another. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ring is a cyclohexene, so it's a six-membered ring with a double bond. So the ring contributes one degree, and the double bond another. So that's two from the ring.

Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me get this straight: the cyclohexene has a ring (1 degree) and a double bond (another degree). So two degrees from the ring's structure.

Then, the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group, which is a double bond (another degree, total 3).

The substituent at position 2 is a methyl group, which doesn't add any.

The carboxylic acid group has a carbonyl (another double bond, total 4 degrees).

Wait, so that's four degrees. But earlier I thought it was three. Hmm, now I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm double-counting. Let me recount:

1. The cyclohexene ring: one ring (1 degree) plus one double bond (another degree). So 2 degrees from the ring system.

2. The vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached at position 5: that's a double bond, adding one degree (total 3).

3. The carboxylic acid group (COOH): that's a carbonyl group (another double bond, total 4).

But wait, the original molecule after reaction is 2-methyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond (so that's two degrees: one for the ring and one for the double bond). Then the vinyl substituent adds another double bond, making it three. The carboxylic acid adds another (four). So the index of hydrogen deficiency would be four.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have 4. The options are 1, 3,5,0. Hmm, So where am I making a mistake?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction. Maybe the reaction doesn't stop at the aldehyde. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. When treated with red phosphorus and HI, the formyl group is reduced. So the formyl (CHO) becomes CH₂. So the substituent at position 2 becomes CH₂.

So the product now has: cyclohexene (with a double bond), a vinyl substituent (with a double bond), carboxylic acid (with a carbonyl), and a methyl group (no double bonds).

So that's two double bonds in the ring (wait, no, the cyclohexene is a single ring with one double bond). Oh wait, no: the cyclohexene ring has one double bond (so one degree) plus the ring structure (another degree). Then, the vinyl group is another double bond (third degree). The carboxylic acid is another (fourth degree). So four in total. But the options don't include four. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the reaction. Does the Wolff-Kishner reaction also affect any other carbonyl groups? For example, if the carboxylic acid is present, would it react under these conditions?

Wait, I think that carboxylic acids are generally not reactive towards Wolff-Kishner conditions. Because in Wolff-Kishner, the reagents are used with aldehydes and ketones, but not typically with carboxylic acids. The amide group (like in amides) can undergo this reaction, but carboxylic acids have a carbonyl that's less reactive. So the carboxylic acid group remains as is.

So, the product has the same carboxylic acid group, same cyclohexene ring, and the formyl group becomes a methyl group. So the substituents are methyl at position 2 and vinyl at position 5.

So, in the product, let's count the double bonds:

1. Cyclohexene: one double bond (1)
2. Vinyl group: another double bond (2)
3. Carboxylic acid: another double bond (3)
4. And the ring counts as one degree (so that's 2 from ring structure: ring plus double bond inside)
Wait, no: the ring is a cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So that's two degrees: one for the ring, one for the double bond. Then the vinyl substituent is another double bond (third), and the carboxylic acid group is another (fourth). But that's four, which isn't an option.

Hmm, but the options don't have 4. So perhaps I made an error in the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the product after reaction doesn't have the same substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the reaction affects more than just the aldehyde. Let me think—maybe the vinyl group is also affected? No, the Wolff-Kishner is for carbonyl groups, so it targets aldehydes and ketones. The vinyl group is an alkene, so it's a double bond but not a carbonyl.

So, the reaction only affects the aldehyde group, converting it into a CH₂ group.

So the product has:

- A cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond → 2 degrees)
- A vinyl substituent (another double bond → +1 → 3)
- A carboxylic acid group (another double bond → +1 → 4)
- A methyl group (no impact).

But according to the options, 4 isn't available. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's structure has a different number of double bonds. Let me think again about the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So the cyclohexene is the ring with a double bond at position 3, which is one double bond. The substituents are formyl (CHO) at position 2 and vinyl (CH₂=CH–) at position 5. So in the starting material, the double bonds are:

- The cyclohexene ring: 1
- The vinyl group substituent: 1
- The formyl group's carbonyl: 1
- The carboxylic acid's carbonyl: 1

So four double bonds in the starting material. After the reaction, the formyl group's carbonyl is gone, converted to CH₂, so now we have:

- cyclohexene ring: 1
- vinyl substituent: 1
- carboxylic acid's carbonyl: 1
Total: 3.

So the product would have three degrees of unsaturation. Because the formyl group's carbonyl is converted to CH₂, which removes a double bond. So starting with four, ending with three.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the starting material's degrees of unsaturation. The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Let me calculate its degrees of unsaturation.

The formula for the starting molecule: Let's see. The cyclohexene is C6H10. Then, the substituents are:

- formyl (CHO): which is C=O, adds one carbon, one oxygen, and one hydrogen (since it's R-CHO).
- vinyl (CH₂=CH-): adds two carbons and three hydrogens (CH₂=CH–).
- carboxylic acid (COOH): adds one carbon, two oxygens, and two hydrogens (since it's R-COOH).

Wait, but the formula calculation may be a bit tricky. Let me think of the molecular formula.

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Adding formyl (CHO) adds one C, one O, and one H. So now, 7 C, 11 H, 1 O.

Adding vinyl (CH₂=CH–) adds two C, and how many H? The vinyl is CH₂=CH–, so when attached to the ring, it's CH₂=CH–R. So the substituent contributes two C and three H (since the ring is connected to one end). So adding two C, three H. Now, the count would be 9 C, 14 H, 1 O.

Adding carboxylic acid group (COOH): adds one C, two O, and two H. So now, 10 C, 16 H, 3 O. But wait, wait, the carboxylic acid is at a position, so perhaps that's already part of the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as C9H8O2. Because the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me think:

Cyclohexene: 6 C.

Formyl (CHO): 1 C → total 7.

Vinyl (CH₂=CH–): 2 C → total 9.

Carboxylic acid: 1 C → but that's already accounted for since the ring is cyclohexene. Wait, no, the carboxylic acid is attached to the ring, so it's another substituent. So, perhaps the formula is C9H8O2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula, but perhaps it's better to calculate the degrees of unsaturation in the product.

In the product, after the Wolff-Kishner reaction, the formyl group becomes CH₂. So the substituents are:

- Position 2: CH₂ (no double bonds)
- Position 5: CH₂=CH– (double bond)
- The ring: cyclohexene (double bond)
- The carboxylic acid: COOH (double bond)

So that's three double bonds (vinyl, ring, COOH) and one ring (from the cyclohexene). Wait, but the ring itself is part of the structure. So the cyclohexene has a ring and a double bond. So that's two degrees from the ring structure (one for the ring, one for the double bond). Then, the vinyl substituent adds another (third) and COOH adds another (fourth).

But the product has four degrees. But the options don't have four. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction. Let me think again: the Wolff-Kishner reaction reduces the aldehyde to a CH₂ group. So the product has the same cyclohexene ring, same vinyl group, same carboxylic acid, and the formyl group is now CH₂.

So, the product's structure has:

- Cyclohexene ring (one ring, one double bond → two degrees)
- Vinyl substituent (one double bond → adds one, total three)
- Carboxylic acid (one double bond → total four)
So, four degrees of unsaturation.

But the options are 1,3,5,0. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the ring. Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the ring itself is a six-membered ring, which is one degree, and the double bond inside is another. So that's two degrees.

Then, the vinyl substituent is another double bond (three degrees).

The carboxylic acid is another (four).

So four degrees. But the options don't have four. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider if the reaction affects any other part. Let me think: when the aldehyde is converted to CH₂, does that add any new double bonds? No, it just becomes a single bond.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the hydrogen deficiency using the formula. Let me try that.

The product's formula: Let's take the starting material as C9H8O2. After the reaction, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH₂. CHO is O, so the product has one less O?

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its formula would be C9H8O2.

After the reaction
