Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved here. 

Alright, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually tell us how stable a complex is, right? The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt-containing species. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands, so that would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or maybe another structure. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact complexes, but I think the key is to find the fraction of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ form, which I'll assume is the blue one.

So, first, I think I need to consider all possible complexes that cobalt can form with thiocyanate. The stability constants are given for each complex. Let's list them out:

1. Co^2+ (β1=9)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (β2=40)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (β3=63)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β4=16)

Wait, the stability constant β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of each complex. So, each β represents the formation of the next complex from the previous one. For example, β1 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on.

But when we're calculating the distribution of the species, we need to find the fraction of each complex. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the possible species. Since the total [Co] is 10^-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is higher than [Co], but I'm not sure how that affects it.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total. Because the number of possible complexes is four, but the question is only interested in the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So I'll need to find the fraction of this species.

But wait, the stability constants are given in a way that each β is the formation constant for adding one SCN- ion to the previous complex. So the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. Oh wait, no, the β given is actually the cumulative stability constant for the complex. For example, β_n is the constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n). So if the β's are given in order as β1, β2, β3, β4, then each represents the overall constant for that complex.

Wait a second, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The stability constant (β) for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is defined as:

β_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) ] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So each β is the constant for the entire complex. That means, for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+,

β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

For the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+,

β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

Similarly, β3 is the constant for the third complex, and so on.

But wait, the given β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I have to consider all four complexes.

To find the fractions, I should write the expressions for each species in terms of β and then find the ratio of each species to the total. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species, so [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^- = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But considering the concentrations of all species, perhaps it's easier to work with the fraction of each relative to [Co^2+]. Let me set [Co^2+] as a base and express all other species in terms of [Co^2+].

So, let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then,

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 * [Co(SCN)]^+ * [SCN^-] = β2 * (β1 x [SCN^-]) * [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 x [SCN^-]^2 

Wait, but wait, no, because [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is formed from [Co(SCN)]^+ and another SCN^-:

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 * [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-] 

But [Co(SCN)]^+ is β1 x [SCN^-] because [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 x [Co^2+][SCN^-] = β1 x * 0.1.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 * (β1 x * 0.1) * 0.1 = β2 * β1 * x * (0.1)^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ * [SCN^-] = β3 * (β2 β1 x 0.1²) ) * 0.1 = β3 β2 β1 x (0.1)^3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should use β3 as given, because the given βs are the cumulative constants. Or wait, no, because each β is the cumulative constant for that complex. So the third complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- and its β is β3 = 63.

Wait, but then, the formation of [Co(SCN)_3]^- would be:

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the stepwise and cumulative constants. Because if β3 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_3]^- then the expression is [Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3.

Wait, that would make sense because each βn is the constant for the complex with n SCN- ions.

Wait, but then the way I was calculating before, each step is βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n. So perhaps each [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, all four species can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

So,

[Co^2+] = x

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 x [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 x [SCN^-]^2 = 40 x (0.1)^2 = 40 x * 0.01 = 0.4 x

Wait, but wait, β2 is 40, but if [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2, then it's 40*x*(0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4 x.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 x [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63x * 0.001 = 0.063 x.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^2- would be β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4. But here β4 is 16, so [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = 16 x (0.1)^4 = 16 x 0.0001 = 0.0016 x.

Wait, but wait the question says the stability constants go up to β4=16. So the four species are n=0,1,2,3,4? Or up to n=3?

Wait, wait the complexes are Co^2+ (n=0), [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4). But wait, the given βs are β1, β2, β3, β4, which correspond to n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4 complexes, each with their own β.

Wait, no. Because the stability constant for the first complex (n=1) is β1=9, for the second (n=2) it's β2=40, third (n=3) β3=63, fourth (n=4) β4=16.

So, each [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−(n)} = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, then the concentrations are:

[Co^2+] = x

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 x [SCN]^1 = 9 x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 x [SCN]^2 = 40 x (0.1)^2 = 0.4 x

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 x [SCN]^3 = 63 x (0.1)^3 = 0.063 x

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2−} = β4 x [SCN]^4 = 16 x (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 x

Wait, but the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species:

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

Wait, adding all the terms:

x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x (2.3646) ) = 1e-2 M.

So x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.224e-3 M.

Wait, but wait, the problem is that the [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M. But when considering these complexes, the [SCN^-] is part of the expression, so when we calculate the concentrations of the complexes, their concentrations are proportional to [SCN^-]^n. But in the problem, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much lower than the total possible if all Co is complexed. So perhaps the solution is dilute in SCN^- as well.

Wait, but wait, I think I have a mistake here. Because when you form a complex, the [SCN^-] decreases as it's being consumed. But in this approach, I'm assuming [SCN^-] remains at 0.1 M, which may not be accurate. Because when you form complexes, the actual [SCN^-] would be lower than 0.1 M. So this might not be correct. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the assumption is that [SCN^-] is in large excess, so that its concentration doesn't change much. The problem states that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So if all the Co^2+ were to form, say, the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} complex, then each Co would take 4 SCN^-, so 4 * 1e-2 M = 4e-2 M. But the total [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M = 1e-1 / (4e-2) = 2.5 times more than needed. So perhaps [SCN^-] is in excess, so that we can approximate [SCN^-] as 0.1 M for each term.

So proceeding under that assumption, the earlier calculation holds.

So, with x = 4.2
