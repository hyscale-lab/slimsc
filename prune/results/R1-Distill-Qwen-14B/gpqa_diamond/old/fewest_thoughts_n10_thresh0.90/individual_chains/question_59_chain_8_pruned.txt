Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base and see what's left after they react. Then, whatever is in excess will determine the pH.

Let me list out the given data:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I think the plan is to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then find out which is in excess. If H+ is in excess, I'll find the concentration of H+ and calculate pH. If OH- is in excess, I'll find the concentration of OH- and then pOH, then pH from that.

Wait, but how about the neutralization reaction between the strong acid and strong base? Oh right, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, also dissociates less. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL (0.5 L). Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it contributes H+ but not completely. But wait, when mixed with a strong base, maybe the OH- will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH. Hmm, but maybe I should first find the total H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.2 M, 400 mL (0.4 L). Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it provides 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M, 300 mL (0.3 L). Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles OH-. So moles of OH- = 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, let's add up all the H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + CH3COOH's H+.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so does its H+ get neutralized by the OH- from Ba(OH)2? Or do I have to account for all H+ and OH- in neutralization?

I think the correct approach is to first consider the neutralization between H+ and OH- from all sources.

So, total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. But when you mix it with a strong base, the OH- would deprotonate the acetic acid, right? So maybe I should treat the acetic acid as a source of H+ that can react with OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider all H+ contributions and all OH- contributions, then find the net H+ or OH-.

Wait, but the fact that CH3COOH is a weak acid complicates things because it doesn't release much H+ on its own. However, when OH- is present, it can abstract the H+ from the acetic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization goes as follows:
