Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measure the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. Wait, so that means the wave function must be zero outside of this region, right? Because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero, which matches the given data.

So the wave function is zero when x is less than 1 or greater than 3. Let's write that out. The wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. 

Wait, but for x <1, the wave function must be zero. Let me see. So when x approaches 1 from the left, sqrt(1+x) is sqrt(2), so a/sqrt(2) - 0.5i must be zero. But wait, can that be? Because 0.5i is a complex number. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because for x=1, the wave function is (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i. If x <1, say x=0, then sqrt(1+0)=1, so ψ(0) would be a -0.5i. But the wave function can't be zero there. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3. So when x <1 or x>3, ψ(x)=0. But the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So for x=1, it's (a/sqrt(2)) -0.5i. But that can't be zero unless a is something specific. But wait, maybe the wave function is zero at x=1 and x=3?

Wait, but the question says that when measuring, none were found at x <1 and x>3. So the wave function outside this region is zero, meaning the particle isn't found there. So maybe the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere.

Wait,
