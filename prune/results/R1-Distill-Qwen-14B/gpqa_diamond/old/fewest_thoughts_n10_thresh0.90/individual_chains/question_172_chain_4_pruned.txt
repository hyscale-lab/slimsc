Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this star question. Hmm, the problem says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T). So the formula is n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as those in star 2. So maybe the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is different for each star, and the ratio between the two stars is a factor of 2.

Let me think. Let's denote for star 1, the ratio is R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = 2*(n2_upper / n2_lower) = 2*R2, since star 2's ratio is R2. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So suppose the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited. But wait, that's not exactly the ratio. Let me make it precise.

Actually, let's define for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me say, for each star, the ratio is R_i = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T_i) ), where i is the star (1 or 2).

But according to the problem, in star_1, the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. So I think, the ratio R1 is twice that of R2. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the excited state in star_1 is twice the excited state in star_2. So perhaps n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper. But wait, n
