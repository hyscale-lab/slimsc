Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation will eliminate the compound, probably by disrupting the gene so it doesn't produce the compound anymore.

They used EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations, usually substitutions. So each of the mutants probably has a substitution somewhere in the gene sequence.

Looking at the sequences, the intact gene starts with this segment: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. 

Now, each mutant has changes in the first exon area. Let me check each mutant's sequence.

Mutant 1: 
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the wild type, I see that in the first part, the wild type has TTTCTC. The mutant has TTCTAC. Wait, let me count. The wild type is ATG TTT CT C GCT... The mutant is ATG TCT TAC GCT... Oh wait, looking more carefully.

The wild type starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So the first substitution is at the third nucleotide. Let me see: the wild type's first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… So the first exon part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

So the first few codons change. The wild type's first codon is ATG, which is methionine. Then next codons: TTT is Phe, CTC is Leu, GCT is Ala, etc.

In Mutant 1, the first few codons would be ATG (unchanged), then TCT is Ser, TAC is Tyr, GCT is Ala. So the amino acids change from Phe, Leu, Ala... to Ser, Tyr, Ala. So this is a missense mutation, altering the amino acids but not causing a frameshift. The gene is still likely to produce a protein, maybe nonfunctional or altered.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at this, the sequence after ATG is TTCTAA GCT... So the wild type is TTT CTC GCT. Mutant 2 is TTCTAA GCT. So the first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe) becomes TTC (Ser), then the next codon in wild type is CTC (Leu), which in mutant is TAAGCT.

Wait, maybe I should look at the exact nucleotide changes. Let me line them up:

Wild type: positions 1-22 (just a part):

1: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 2:

1: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So the first codon after ATG is TTT in wild, in mutant it's TTC (so that's a change—Phe to Ser). Then the next part: wild is CTC GCT. Mutant has TAA GCT. Let me count the nucleotides.

Wild type: positions 4-10: CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant 2: positions 4-10: TAA GCT GGT ACT.

Wait, the mutant's second codon after TTC is TAA. So the sequence is TTC TAA. That would be Ser and then Tyr (since TAA is Tyr in DNA, but wait, DNA is TAA which would code for Tyr in mRNA as AUG, but wait, let me think about the transcription. The gene is DNA, which is non-template, so TAA is the same as on the coding strand. The mRNA would be AUG, which is Methionine. Wait, no, DNA is read as coding strand, so TAA in DNA would be mRNA as AUG, which is Met.

Wait no, wait. DNA is double stranded, but the coding strand is the same as mRNA, except T for U. So for the coding (sense) strand, TAA would be mRNA as AUA? Wait, no: the DNA is the coding strand, so each T becomes U. So TAA in DNA would be mRNA as AUU, which is Asn. Wait, no, sorry, let me think:

DNA to mRNA is transcription. DNA has a coding strand and a template. The coding strand is the same as mRNA, except Ts become Us. So, for instance, the DNA sequence ATG would be same as mRNA, except U instead of T. So the coding strand DNA sequence is read as the mRNA.

So in mutant 2, the part after ATG TTC (which is position 3-5: TTC) is then TAA. So the next codon is TAA in DNA → mRNA is TAA → wait, no, wait, the mRNA is synthesized as complementary to the template strand. So the coding strand (same as mRNA) has TAA, so the mRNA would have UAA. UAA is a stop codon.

Wait, so in mutant 2, after ATG TTC (which is Met Ser), the next codon is TAA in DNA → mRNA is UAA, which is a stop codon. So the gene would produce a truncated protein, because the ribosome would stop at the stop codon. So this would likely disrupt the protein, possibly making it nonfunctional. That could eliminate the compound.

Hmm, that's interesting. So mutant 2 has a stop codon introduced early in the coding sequence. That might disable the gene, preventing the compound from being synthesized.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So let's compare.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, the first part: the wild has TTT CTC GCT, and mutant 3 has TTT TAC GCT. Oh wait, no, the exact sequence:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...

Wait, the sequence after ATG is TTT CTC GCT in wild. In mutant, it's TTT TAC GCT. So the first codon is TTT (Phe), same as wild. The next codon: wild is CTC (Leu), mutant is TAC (Tyr). Then wild has GCT (Ala), mutant has GCT as well. Wait, no, the next part is GCT GGT in wild. In mutant, it's GCT GGT. Wait, perhaps a substitution elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in the fourth codon. Let me look more carefully.

Wild: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant3: ...TAC GCT GGT GTC...

Wait, maybe the exact change is that in the wild type, it's CTC GCT GGT ACT. In mutant 3, it's TAC GCT GGT GTC.

Wait, perhaps the substitution is in the third codon. So wild has CTC (Leu), mutant has TAC (Tyr). So that's a change in amino acid.

Moreover, looking further, in the wild, the next codon after GCT is GGT (Gly), then ACT (Thr). In mutant 3, after GCT is GGT (same), then GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So another substitution. So this is a missense mutation, changing two amino acids. The gene is still intact, so the protein might be altered but probably not completely nonfunctional. Unless the changes are in a critical region.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, comparing to wild:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, the first codon after ATG: TTT (Phe) same as wild. Then wild has CTC (Leu), which in mutant is TAC (Tyr). Then wild has GCT (Ala), which in mutant is ACT (Thr). So two amino acid changes: Leu to Tyr and Ala to Thr. So again, missense mutations. The gene is still producing a protein, perhaps altered but not completely nonfunctional.

So the question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would happen if the gene is not functional anymore, so the protein isn't made. So a mutation that disrupts the gene's product.

Looking at the options, Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon early on. So the protein would be shorter, probably nonfunctional. The others change some amino acids but don't disrupt the reading frame or cause a premature stop. So Mutant 2's mutation would likely eliminate the compound.

Wait, but wait. The wild type might have a longer sequence. Let me make sure about the positions. The question says the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area. So if the mutation is in the first exon, perhaps in an exon that's part of the coding region.

Mutant 2's change leads to an early stop. That would likely produce a nonfunctional protein. So that would be the desired outcome.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene sequence. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.
