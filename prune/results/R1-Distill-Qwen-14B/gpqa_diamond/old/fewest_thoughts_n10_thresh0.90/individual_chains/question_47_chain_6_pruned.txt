Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, each with different structures.

First, let's look at the IR data. The strong bands are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those look like N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or amine. Amides typically have two N-H stretches, which could explain the two bands. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Since the molecular formula has an O2, maybe it's an ester or amide.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down.

- 1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H): This looks like a CH3 group attached to something that has two neighboring protons, maybe an ethyl group. Like an ethyl ester's CH3.
- 4.0 ppm broad singlet (bs, 2H): Broad signals often suggest exchange, like NH protons. But wait, in the IR, we saw N-H signals, so maybe an amide or amine. But in the NMR, this could be an NH2 group, but it's a singlet and broad. Alternatively, it might be an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2. Hmm, but 4 ppm is more in the range of OCH2 or maybe an N-attached CH.
Wait, let me think. For ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 around 4.1 ppm as a quartet, but in this case, the 1.20 is a triplet, which fits with an ethyl's CH3. Then the 4.0 ppm could be a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps an OCH2, but wait, in ethyl esters, the OCH2 is usually around 4.1 and a quartet. Hmm, maybe it's not an ester then.

Looking further, there's a 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H). Quartet with 2H suggests a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. So maybe like OCH2CH2O or similar. Wait, but in ethyl esters, the CH2 next to oxygen would be a quartet. Let me think. In an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 at around 4.1 as a quartet and the CH3 as a triplet at around 1.2. So the 4.0 ppm in the given data is a bit lower than expected. Maybe it's not an ester then.

Alternatively, the 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H) could be part of an amide structure. Or perhaps an acetamide's CH2 group. Wait, also, if this is an amide, the NMR might show the NH as broad, which is what the 4.0 ppm is.

Wait, the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are doublets. Those are aromatic protons. The two doublets each with 2H suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So, for example, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each causing the neighboring protons to split into doublets. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.

Putting this together, the compound likely has a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents could be an amide group or an ester.

Looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2=1
