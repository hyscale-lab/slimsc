Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that we're taking 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, so first, let me think about the initial solution after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we add water, we're diluting it, which should decrease the concentration of H+ ions, right? But how does that affect the pH? Well, I remember that diluting a weak acid doesn't just reduce the H+ linearly because the acid can dissociate more.

Let me calculate the concentration first. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume in liters, so 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate it with NaOH. The initial solution is 40 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid. The NaOH is 0.1 M. I think I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration in this context? I think it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, if the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So the moles of NaOH added would be 0.00025, since the reaction is 1:1 for CH3COOH and NaOH.

But wait, the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, so the volume used at 25% would be moles / Molarity = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. Hmm, but wait, the total volume at that point would be initial 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL. But maybe I don't need that right now.

Alternatively, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted, so 100% titration. So let me first calculate the equivalence point volume.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid will react with NaOH. So the moles of NaOH needed are 0.001. The volume would be 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

So for each part, 25% and 100% titration, I need to find the pH.

Let me handle each case one by one.

First, at 25% titration: 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

So if initially, we have 0.001 moles CH3COOH. 25% is 0.00025 moles reacted. So remaining
