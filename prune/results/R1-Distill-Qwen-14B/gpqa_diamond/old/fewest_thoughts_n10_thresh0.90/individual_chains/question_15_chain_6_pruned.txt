Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance of the planet. But wait, what exactly determines the probability?

I think the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how does that translate into probabilities? Oh right, the probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, I think it's more like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, actually, the transit probability formula I recall is based on the ratio of the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. The formula is something like (R_star / a) * (something else?), or maybe it's the (R_star / a) squared or not. Let me think. Oh, wait, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned, which depends on the inclination. Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is about (R_star / a) because it's the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit, but considering the orbital inclination.

Wait, perhaps a more precise approach is needed. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will cause a transit is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, maybe involving the inclination. Or wait, I think the formula is simply (R*/a) * (something else?), perhaps considering the relative sizes and orbital parameters.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) when the orbit is inclined, but since both are circular (e=0), that part goes away. So for circular orbits, the transit probability is (R_star / a). So, the probability is R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (which is the same as the orbital radius for circular orbits).

So the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_1 = R_2 = R. So the transit probability depends purely on a: the semi-major axis.

Wait, no, wait. Because both stars have the same radius, but R* is same for both. So the transit probability for each planet is (R*/a) where a is the planet's orbital radius.

But wait, the planets' orbital periods are given. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Using Kepler's third law, which says P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) a³, but since M (star's mass) >> m (planet's mass), it's approximately P² = (4π²/(G M)) a³. So a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

Wait, but each planet is around a different star. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 M2.

Let me compute a1 and a2 for the two planets.

For Planet_1: P1 = (1/3) P2. So P1² = (1/9) P2².

So a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1²) / (4π²) = (G * (2 M2) * (1/9 P2²)) / (4 π²)

For Planet_2: a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2²) / (4 π²)

So a1^3 = (2 M2 * P2²) * (1/9) / (4 π²) * G / (4 π²) ?

Wait, maybe simplifying:

a1^3 / a2^3 = ( (2 M2) * (P1^2) ) / ( M2 * P2^2 ) )

But P1 = P2/3, so P1^2 = P2² /9.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M2 * (P2²/9) ) / ( M2 * P2² ) )

Simplify numerator: 2 M2 * P2² /9.

Denominator: M2 * P2².

So ratio is (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) * a2^3.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, let's compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of that is roughly 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222.

So a1 ≈ 0.6 * a2.

But wait, because a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet_1, and a2 is that of Planet_2.

Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up.

Wait, let me redo the Kepler's law part.

Kepler's law: a³ = (G(M + m) P²)/(4 π²).

But since m is negligible, a³ = (G M P²)/(4 π²).

So for each planet:

a1 = cube_root( (G M1 P1²)/(4 pi²) )

a2 = cube_root( (G M2 P2²)/(4 pi²) )

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 pi² )

= (G M2 P2²) / (4 pi²) ) * (2 * (1/9) )

= (G M2 P2²)/(4 pi²) ) * (2/9 )

= a2^3 * (2/9 )

So a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 )

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 = approx 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Now, the transit probability is (R_star / a).

Since R_star is same for both, as per the question: both host stars have same radii.

So transit probability for Planet_1: P1_t = R/a1.

Transit probability for Planet_2: P2_t = R/a2.

So the ratio P1_t / P2_t = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 is 0.6 a2, a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So P1_t is about 1.666 times P2_t.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2.

But wait, the question says researchers are choosing to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting.

So if Planet_
