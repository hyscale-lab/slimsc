Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface in geometry, but I'm not exactly sure about its properties. Let me think. Pseudospheres are like a type of surface with constant negative curvature, right? They have some interesting geometric properties, like infinite length geodesics but finite area.

The question gives a metric: ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric because it's expressed as a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Conformally flat metrics are useful because you can sometimes simplify calculations using them.

I'm trying to find the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. But wait, the metric given depends on x and y, not r. Hmm, maybe I need to relate it to polar coordinates? Because x² + y² would then be r², right. So maybe I should express everything in terms of r. Let's see, if x² + y² = r², then the denominator in the metric is (4 - r²).

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Or wait, no, the original is in terms of dx and dy, which in polar coordinates would be dr and r dθ. So substituting that, yes, the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). 

But how do I find the area? Oh right, the area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ. But wait, in this metric, the line element is conformal, so the area element would involve the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. 

Wait, no, the area element in a two-dimensional metric is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. But since it's conformally flat, the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the determinant is g_xx * g_yy. So the area element becomes sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant.

Wait, the metric tensor for this is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2. The area element would then be sqrt(det g) dx dy, which is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy. But wait, dx dy in polar coordinates is r dr dθ. So the area element dA is [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral of dA over the entire surface. What are the limits of r? The denominator (4 - r²) must be positive to have real values, so 4 - r² > 0 → r² <4 → r <2. Oh, so the radius of the pseudosphere is 2, and r goes from 0 to 2. So, the area is the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π.

Wait, but hold on. The metric might have a singularity at r=2. Because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric terms blow up. That might mean the area is infinite? Or does it somehow cancel out?

Let me compute the integral. The area A is ∫∫ dA = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Factor out constants: 32 * ∫0^2π dθ * ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Hmm, let me compute the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²) = ∫ (-1/2) du / u = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

So from r=0 to 2:

At r=2, u=4-4=0 → ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, but wait, let's evaluate the definite integral.

The integral from 0 to 2 is [ (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2.

At r=2: ln(0) → -infinity → (-1/2)(-infty) = +infty.

At r=0: ln(4) → some finite value. So the integral becomes:

[ (1/2 ln(4)) ] - [ (1/2)(-infty) ] → (positive finite) + infty = infty.

Wait, no. Let me recheck:

Wait the integral becomes (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] evaluated from u=4 (when r=0) to u=0 (when r=2).

So it's (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-1/2) [ -infty - ln(4) ] → (-1/2) (-infty) → positive infinity. Because [ ln(0) ] is -infty.

So the integral ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr is equal to [ (1/2) ln(4/(0)) ) ] → which is (1/2) (infinite), so it diverges to infinity.

So the area A would be 32 * 2π * (infinite) → which is infinite. So the area is infinite.

But wait, the options have D) +infty as an option. So the answer would be D.

But wait, I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Oh wait, maybe I confused pseudosphere with something else. Wait, the standard pseudosphere, which is the tractricoid, has finite area. So why is the calculation leading to infinite area here?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the integral. Let me think again about the metric. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Alternatively, in polar coordinates, that's ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). 

Wait, but perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area. Oh wait, no, the pseudosphere itself is a finite area surface. But maybe the metric given here is not that of a pseudosphere but something else.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing between the metric of a pseudosphere and that of hyperbolic space. Let me think: the standard pseudosphere is a surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space and has finite area. But the given metric might be representing a different kind of space.

Wait, let's see: the metric is conformally flat and the line element is ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So this is a 2D metric, probably with negative curvature. Let's compute the Gaussian curvature.

For a metric of the form ds² = E(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by [1/(2E)] * [d/dr (r E') / r ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the curvature using the formula for a conformally flat metric. Gaussian curvature K is [ - (1/(2 E)) ) * (d/dr (E r)) ) ] / r.

Let me compute E(r) = 32/(4 - r²).

Compute E' = dE/dr = 32 * (2r)/(4 - r²)^2 → 64 r / (4 - r²)^2.

Then, d/dr (E r) = E + r E'.

Substituting: [32/(4 - r²)] + r * [64 r/(4 - r²)^2)].

= [32 (4 - r²) + 64 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Simplify numerator: 128 -32 r² +64 r² = 128 +32 r².

So, d/dr (E r) = (128 +32 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, curvature K = [ - (1/(2 E)) * (d/dr (E r) ) ] / r.

Wait, I'm not sure if I got the formula right. Alternatively, for a metric ds² = a(r)² (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = [ -1/(2 r a²) ] * d/dr (r a²).

Wait, let's set a²(r) = 32/(4 - r²). Then a² = 32/(4 - r²).

Compute d/dr (r a²) → derivative of r * (32/(4 - r²)).

Which is (32 r)/(4 - r²) + r * [ 64 r/(4 - r^2)^2 ].

Wait, that's similar to what I did before. So d/dr (r a²) = [32 r (4 - r²) + 64 r² ]/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, 32 r (4 - r²) = 128 r -32 r^3. So numerator: 128 r -32 r^3 +64 r² → 128 r +64 r²-32 r^3.

Then, K = [ -1/(2 r a²) ) * (128 r +64 r² -32 r^3/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ].

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, perhaps the Gaussian curvature is constant.

Wait, if the metric is for a space of constant curvature, then the area would depend on whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

Wait, the standard pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The given metric may represent a space with Gaussian curvature K. If K is negative, then the area of a compact surface (like a pseudosphere) should be finite.

But earlier, when I integrated the area, I got an infinite result, which seems to contradict that. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the area integral.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area element correctly. The area element in a metric is given by sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

In this case, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant g is (32/(4 - r²))^2. The area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. In polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area element dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element blow up. So if we integrate from r=0 to 2, perhaps the integral diverges, leading to an infinite area.

But wait, pseudospheres are supposed to have finite area. So perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, but rather a model of hyperbolic space, which indeed has infinite area.

Wait, the question says, "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The standard pseudosphere has Gaussian curvature K = -1/(a^2), where a is the radius of curvature. So for a radius of 2, K would be -1/(4).

But in my calculation earlier, the area integral diverges. So that suggests that the metric given is not that of a pseudosphere but perhaps a hyperbolic plane, which does have infinite area. So maybe the answer is D) +infty.

But I'm not 100% confident. Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Let me recheck it.

The integral to compute is ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ, integrated over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let me make a substitution. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So the integral ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] from 0 to 2 becomes ∫ [ (-du/2 ) / u ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0 → (-1/2)[ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

That's (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so:

(-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → (-1/2)( -infty) → positive infinity.

So the radial integral diverges, which means the area is infinite. So the answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric, and in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), it becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left( dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \right).
\]

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element \(dA\). For a conformally flat metric, the area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\text{det}(g)\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

In polar coordinates, \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\), so:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area \(A\) is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the entire surface. The limits for \(r\) are from \(0\) to \(2\) (since \(4 - r^2 > 0\) implies \(r < 2\)), and for \(\theta\), the limits are \(0\) to \(2\pi\). Thus:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the \(\theta\)-integral:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Now, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{1}{2} du = r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
-\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln 4 - \ln 0\right].
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \infty.
\]

Thus, the total area \(A\) is:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \infty = +\infty.
\]

This result indicates that the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite. While the standard pseudosphere (e.g., the tractricoid) has finite area, the metric provided here appears to describe a space with infinite area, possibly due to the singularity at \(r = 2\).
