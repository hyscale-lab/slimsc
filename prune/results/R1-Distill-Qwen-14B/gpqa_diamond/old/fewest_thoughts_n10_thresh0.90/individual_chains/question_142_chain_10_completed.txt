Okay, so I've got this problem about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ: (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But wait, wait—if the density matrix is a pure state, it's a projector, right? But if it's a mixture, it's a statistical ensemble.

So, let me write down the matrix for ρ. Each term |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors. The identity matrix for a single qubit is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. So ρ is (1/2) times the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2.

Wait, what does the identity matrix look like in 2x2 form? It's [[1,0],[0,1]]. So ρ would be [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what this means. Oh, right! I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's represented as a vector on the unit sphere. But density matrices can be represented as points in a higher-dimensional space, or maybe using the Bloch sphere as well.

Wait, I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). The vector r has components (x, y, z), and its length determines whether it's a pure or mixed state. If |r|=1, it's a pure state; else, it's mixed.

So let's apply that to our ρ. The given ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2. Because ρ = (I)/2, so r·σ must be zero. That implies r is (0,0,0). Because if you have r·σ = 0, each component multiplied by the Pauli matrices sums to zero, which can only happen if r is zero.

Wait, let me double-check. The expansion would be (I + rx σx + ry σy + rz σz)/2. If our ρ is I/2, then the coefficients rx, ry, rz must all be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That corresponds to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because ρ here is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so that's the answer. Other options: A is (1,1,0), which would give a magnitude of sqrt(2), so a mixed state. B is (0,0,1), which would be a pure state. D is (1,1,1), magnitude sqrt(3), so also mixed. So none of those are the case here, since our r is zero.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is consistent with the maximally mixed state represented by \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** This implies a non-zero Bloch vector, corresponding to a mixed state, but not the maximally mixed state.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1):** This corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0):** This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which matches the given \(\rho\).
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1):** This implies a non-zero Bloch vector, corresponding to a mixed state, but not the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
