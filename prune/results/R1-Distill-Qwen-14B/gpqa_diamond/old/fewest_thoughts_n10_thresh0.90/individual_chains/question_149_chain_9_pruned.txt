Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question about a peptidic compound. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly like what was expected, except there are two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So that suggests each is about 0.5H? Wait, but that might not make sense because you can't split a proton into half. Or maybe each is integrating to about the same, like each is 0.5H.

They also say that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm, because if it was coupling with another proton, you might see splitting. So maybe it's something else causing these peaks.

Then looking at the LC-MS: when the crude compound is analyzed at elevated temp, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So same mass, same retention time? Or wait, same mass but maybe different retention times? Or perhaps they're eluting at different times but both are the same mass. But why two peaks?

The options are about possible explanations. Let's look at each option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Wait, a precursor would likely have a different mass, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction. So in the LC-MS, the mass would be different. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, non-superimposable. They would have the same molecular weight and same retention times on a regular column because they move at the same speed. But if the LC is using a chiral column, they'd separate. The question doesn't mention the column type. But if the LC shows two peaks, maybe they're enantiomers. But wait, in the NMR, how would that look? Enantiomers have the same NMR spectrum because they're identical in physical properties except for the direction of optical rotation. So if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same peaks as a pure sample. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So that doesn't fit. Because enantiomers would not cause splitting in the NMR. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. 'Double coupling' might refer to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, but that usually leads to more complex splitting patterns, not two separate peaks. Alternatively, maybe during the reaction, like if a coupling reaction led to two different products. Wait, but the question says the NMR is for the crude compound, which is after synthesis. If double coupling happened, perhaps it's causing each proton to split differently. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe not. I'm not too sure. Maybe this is a possible option, but let me think more.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR spectra. In the NMR, if two diastereomers are present, and the alpha-proton is in a different environment, you might see two peaks for that proton. But why would the integrals add up to 1H? Because each diastereomer has the same number of protons in that position, but in different environments. Wait, but if the mixture is 50:50, each would contribute their own peak. So for each molecule, the alpha-proton would be split into two, but that's not quite right. Wait, perhaps the diastereomers have the same number of protons, but in different environments, so each contributes a peak. So the integral would add up to 1H if each is around 0.5H. Hmm, that makes sense.

In the LC-MS, if the sample is a mixture of diastereomers, they might have different retention times because they have different physical properties. But wait, the question says both have the same mass and same mass spectrum. So they have the same molecular weight. But wait, diastereomers have same molecular weight, but different structures. So their mass spectra would be the same because same molecular formula. So that fits. But why would the LC show two peaks? Because diastereomers may have different retention times on a regular column. But the question says the two peaks have the same mass, which is the expected. So it's possible, but why would the NMR show two peaks?

Wait, another thought. If the compound is a diastereomeric mixture, then in the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute their own set of peaks. For a diastereomer, the environment of the protons would be different, so each would have their own shift. So for the alpha-proton, each diastereomer would have a different shift. But the question says NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same shift. Wait, that contradicts. Unless the diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the diastereomers are in such a way that the alpha-proton is in the same environment. No, usually diastereomers have different environments. So perhaps the NMR would show two sets of peaks, but the question says it's the same alpha-proton. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe it's not diastereomers. Let me think again. The NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same shift. Wait, no, the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So close, but not the same. Maybe that's due to something else.

Wait, what about enantiomers? Enantiomers would have same NMR, so that can't be it. So that can't explain the two peaks.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is with the synthesis. For example, during the formation of an amide bond, maybe there's an issue like a coupling that creates two different products. Wait, but that would likely change the molecular weight. Oh, but the options say 'double coupling' during amide bond forming. Maybe that's about the formation of an amide where the coupling leads to two different products, but same molecular formula? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about tautomers. But in that case, the NMR would show different shifts, but LC-MS would show two peaks with same mass.

Wait, but the question says the NMR peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So two peaks for that one proton. But why would that happen? Maybe it's due to exchange between different tautomers, but that would usually involve more than one proton change.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis resulted in a mixture of two diastereomers where the alpha-proton is in a different environment for each. But in that case, wouldn't the shifts be different, leading to two distinct peaks for that proton. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So perhaps they are very close.

Wait, but the question says the NMR has two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. So the same proton in the structure, but appearing as two peaks. That suggests that each peak is from the same proton in different environments. So maybe the molecule is in a dynamic situation, like
