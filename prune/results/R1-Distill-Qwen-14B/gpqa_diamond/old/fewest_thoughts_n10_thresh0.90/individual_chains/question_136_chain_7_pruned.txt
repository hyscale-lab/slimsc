Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Let me try to break it down.

First, the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r². It only has a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, the field is something like f(r) = (F_r) e_r, where F_r is the magnitude. Since F_r = 1/r², the field is f(r) = (1/r²) e_r.

The integral we're supposed to compute is the volume integral of the divergence of f. So, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV, and the region is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, but I remember the Divergence Theorem. The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. The theorem says that ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS, where n is the outward unit normal vector. So the volume integral is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

But wait, in this case, our field f is only radial, and it's defined everywhere except maybe at the origin. So the divergence theorem should apply as long as f is smooth within the volume of the sphere. Hmm, but wait, what about the origin? Because if the field is 1/r², then at r=0, the field is undefined (infinite). So does that affect the application of the divergence theorem?

Wait, the divergence theorem requires the vector field to be differentiable everywhere inside and on the boundary of the volume. If r=0 is included, then the field has a singularity there. So maybe the volume integral isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps we can proceed if we consider that the divergence is defined except at the origin. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the divergence of f in spherical coordinates directly. Since f has only a radial component, the divergence formula in spherical coordinates is simpler. Let me recall: the divergence of a vector field with components (A_r, A_θ, A_φ) in spherical coordinates is given by (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r)/dr] + (1/(r sinθ)) [d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ] + (1/(r sinθ)) [1/φ] [d A_φ/dφ]. But since our field has only A_r non-zero, the other terms are zero. So divergence ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r).

In this case, A_r is 1/r², so let's plug that in. So:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) )

Simplify inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r
