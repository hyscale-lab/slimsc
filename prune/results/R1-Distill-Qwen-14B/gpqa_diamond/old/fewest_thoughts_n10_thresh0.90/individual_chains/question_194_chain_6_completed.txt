Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where E is the energy of each state. But wait, in this case, the energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, I need to figure out all the possible combinations and their corresponding energies.

Wait, but first, maybe I can find the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's think about all possible states for S1, S2, S3. Each can be ±1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I can list them all and compute the sum for each.

State 1: S1=1, S2=1, S3=1. Then the terms are (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 +1 +1 =3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. Then terms are (1)(1)=1, (1)(-1)=-1, (1)(-1)=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 =-1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1. Terms are (1)(-1)=-1, (1)(1)=1, (-1)(1)=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. E = J.

State 4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Terms: (1)(-1)=-1, (1)(-1)=-1, (-1)(-1)=1. Sum: -1-1+1 = -1. E=J.

State 5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1. Terms: (-1)(1)=-1, (-1)(1)=-1, (1)(1)=1. Sum: -1-1+1 = -1. E=J.

State6: S1=-1,S2=1,S3=-1. Terms: (-1)(1)=-1, (-1)(-1)=1, (1)(-1)=-1. Sum: -1+1-1= -1. E=J.

State7: S1=-1,S2=-1,S3=1. Terms: (-1)(-1)=1, (-1)(1)=-1, (-1)(1)=-1. Sum:1-1-1 =-1. E=J.

State8: S1=-1,S2=-1,S3=-1. Terms are all 1: 1+1+1=3. E=-3J.

Wait, so how many states have E=-3J? Two: state1 and state8.

How about E=J? Well, states 2 through 7 are 6 states, all with E=J.

Wait wait, no, wait. Let me recount the states. Wait, when I listed all 8 states, state1 was (+,+,+), E=-3J. state2: (+,+,-) → gives E= J? Let me recalculate state2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. So S1S2 is 1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. Correct.

Similarly, state3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1. S1S2 =-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E=J.

State4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2= -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1= -1 → E=J.

State5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1=-1 → E=J.

State6: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum -1 +1 -1 =-1 → E=J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum 1 -1 -1 =-1 → E=J.

State8: all -1. Sum 3 → E=-3J.

So there are two states with E=-3J and six states with E=J.

So the partition function Z is the sum of exp(-βE) for each state. Each state's contribution is exp(-β E_i). So for the two states with E=-3J each, each contributes exp(3Jβ) because E is -3J, so -β E = 3Jβ.

The six states with E=J each contribute exp(-Jβ) because E=J → -β E= -Jβ.

So Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ). Let me look at the options.

Option A: 2e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ). No, signs are wrong.

Option B: 2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ). Yes, this matches what I have.

Option C: 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ). No, exponents are double.

Option D:6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ). No.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the given system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), we start by analyzing the energy of the system, \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). Each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), leading to \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. By evaluating \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) for each state, we find the following:

1. **States with \( E = -3J \):** These occur when all spins align (either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)). There are 2 such states, and their contribution to \( Z \) is \( 2e^{3J\beta} \), since \( E = -3J \) implies \( -\beta E = 3J\beta \).

2. **States with \( E = J \):** These occur when two spins align and one opposes them. There are 6 such states, and their contribution to \( Z \) is \( 6e^{-J\beta} \), since \( E = J \) implies \( -\beta E = -J\beta \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A:** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \). Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \). Correct, as it matches the derived expression.
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \). Incorrect, as the exponents are doubled.
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \). Incorrect, as both the coefficients and exponents are incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**.
