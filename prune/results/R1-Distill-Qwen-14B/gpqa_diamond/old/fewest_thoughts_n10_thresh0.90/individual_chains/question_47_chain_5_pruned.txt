Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are medium to strong. Those are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or amide. So the compound probably has an NH group. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide since those have strong absorption around there.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down.

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group. Because a triplet in the 1.2 ppm region is typical for CH2CH3. Like an ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet makes me think it's an NH2 group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group? But if it's an NH, but in the NMR, a broad peak can be from exchange with water, which is common for amines. But wait, the molecular formula has only one N. So maybe it's an amide or something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet indicates coupling with two neighboring protons. So that's probably a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe connected to an oxygen. Like OCH2CH2O? Or OCH2 connected to something else.

7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. And 8.0 ppm, another doublet, 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the doublets in the aromatic region typically indicate two protons each, which is common for a para arrangement. So two substituents on a benzene ring, para to each other.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring has two substituents. One is probably an electron-donating group, like OCH2 or something else. The other substituent could be another group like a carbonyl or another oxygen-containing group.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So the substituents would be ethoxy and the amide group. But wait, benzamide is CONH2. So if it's at position 3, would that affect the NMR? The aromatic protons would be at ortho and para positions. But in the NMR, we have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That might suggest two substituents causing splitting. Alternatively, perhaps a di-substituted benzene, like para-substituted.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONH- attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. Wait, formamide is RCONH2, but as a formamide, maybe it's HCONR2? Or in this case, the structure would be O=CH-NH-Ph-OEt. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH- attached to something. So the structure would have a formamide group attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the aromatic would have OEt group and the formamide group. But wait, formamide is a primary amide, so the NH would be present. But the IR shows N-H peaks. So that would fit.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO-? Or maybe CH2CH2COO- as the ester. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would have an amino group at para position and a propionate group. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If the amino group is NH2, that would make sense. But the propionate ester would have an OCH2CH2COO- group. Wait, no, if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure would be PhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3? Or maybe the propionate is an ester, like OCOCH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for a -CH2CH2- group. Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet is 3H, so that would suggest a CH3 at the end of a CH2 group. So maybe a ethyl group somewhere.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So that's benzoate ester where the benzoate is at para to an amino group. Structure is OCOCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, and an NH2 group at the para position. Wait, no, wait. Benzoate would be OCO-R. So ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be: benzene with COOEt and NH2 at para positions.

Let me think about the NMR for each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is:

Ph–NH2
|
COOEt

So the protons would be:

The ethyl group: CH2CH3. The triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H) would be the CH3 of the ethyl ester. Then, the CH2 connected to oxygen would be a quartet at 4.5 ppm? Wait, no. Wait, the ethoxyl group in the ester would have two sets of peaks. The CH2 connected to the O would be a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH3), usually around 4.0-4.3 ppm. Then the CH3 would be a triplet around 1.2 ppm.

Looking at the NMR data: 1.20 (t,3H), which would be the ethyl CH3. Then 4.5 ppm (q,2H) would be the OCH2 in the ester, which is connected to the carbonyl. That quartet because it's next to the CH3. Then 4.0 ppm (bs,2H) could be the NH2 group, but wait, amines have broad signals. But in D, the NH2 would be on the benzene. Wait, but the NMR shows 2H at 4.0 ppm. So that doesn't fit, because the NH2 protons are usually broad, but they're two protons. Wait, in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene, so the NMR would have a singlet for the NH2 protons? Or they might not show up because of exchange broadening, but in some cases, the NH2 protons might appear as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is some other group.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. Let me think. If the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ester group is OCOOCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be at about 4.2 ppm, as a quartet. Then the CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2 ppm. The 4.5 ppm in the data is a quartet with 2H; that would fit the OCH2 of the ester. The 4.0 ppm, a broad singlet, 2H—could that be the NH2? But in that case, the NMR would show a broad peak for two protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH2 group. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, so perhaps it's an NH group? Wait, the molecular formula has one N. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check the molecular formulas of the options.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be C7H7NO2 (benzoate) plus ethyl (C2H5). So total is C9H10NO3? Wait, wait. Let me calculate.

Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ester would be C7H5O2 plus C2H5O? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO3? Because the benzoate is C7H5O2-, plus ethyl (C2H5), so total would be C9H10O3, but with an N from the amine. Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The formula for 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO3 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, adding NH2 would make it C7H7NO3). Then, when you esterify it with ethanol, you'd replace the -OH with OEt. So the ester would be C7H6O3 (from the acid) + C2H5O, but wait, the esterification would lose an H2O. So the formula would be C9H10NO3. But the question says the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's a problem. So option D might not fit the molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me calculate again. The molecular formula of the compound is C9H11NO2. So each option must have that.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at 3. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would make it C9H11NO2. Because benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding OCH2CH3 (which is O-C2H5) would add 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens. Wait, but benzamide is C7H7NO2, so adding OCH2CH3 would make it C9H11NO2. So that fits.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH-R. So the structure would be O=CH-NH-Ph-OEt. The formula: Ph is C6H5, OEt is C2H5O, so total would be C6 (Ph) + C2 (OEt) + HCONH- (which is C=O and NH, so adds one C). So total C9. Then hydrogens: Ph has 5 H (since 4-ethoxy would have one substituent, but wait, the formamide is attached to the benzene. So the benzene is C6H4-OEt (since OEt is at 4, and formamide is at 4? Wait, no, 4-ethoxyphenyl group would have the ethoxy at position 4, and the formamide is attached at position... wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the molecular formula would be C6H5 (Ph) minus one H (since attached to OEt and formamide). So the formula would be C6H5- OEt is C2H5O, so adding to the benzene, that's C8H11O2. Then the formamide part adds O and another C. Wait, formamide is HCONH- attached to the benzene. So that's adding one C (from HCO), so total is C9. Let me see: C6 (Ph) + OEt (C2) + HCO (C1) + NH (no C). So C9. Hydrogen: Ph would have 4 H (since two substituents at para), OEt is C2H5 (5 H?), and formamide has HCONH- which has 2 H (the H from HCO and the NH). Wait, maybe I'm getting lost here, but the molecular formula should match. Let me think: C6H5 is C6H5. Then OEt is OCH2CH3 (adds 2 C, 5 H). Then formamide is HCONH- (adds 1 C, 2 H: the H from HCO and the NH). But wait, how are the substituents arranged? The molecular formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 (which is C8H11O?), and the formamide adds HCONH- (which is HCONH-Ph-OEt). So the formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be C9H11NO2. Because O from OEt, O from HCO, and another O from the amide? Wait, HCONHR is formamide, which has O from the carbonyl. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. So option B fits.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- (but more accurately, CH2CH2COO- as an ester). So the structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH-COOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. The propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be because then it's a secondary amide. Wait, maybe it's PhNH2 attached to the propionate ester. So the structure would be (PhNH2)COOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H5NH2-COOCH2CH2CH3. So the molecular formula would be C6H5 (C6H5) + NH2 (adds 1N, 2H) + COOCH2CH2CH3 (which is C3H6O2). So total C: 6 + 3 + 1 (from COO?) Wait, maybe I'm not getting it right. Let me count:

Ph group: C6H5
NH2: adds N, no C
Propionate: COOCH2CH2CH3 is C3H7O2
So overall: C6 + C3 + 1 (from COO?) No, wait, COO is part of the propionate. So the propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester group is OCOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula is C6H5 (Ph) + NH2 (no C) + OCOCH2CH2CH3 (C3H6O2). So total C: 6 +3 =9, H:5 (Ph) + (2 from NH2) + (7 from ester: OCOCH2CH2CH3 has 7 H) → 5+2+7=14, but with the ester, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the molecular formula would be C9H13NO3? Hmm, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's a problem. So option C might not fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2COOEt. So the benzoate ester is PhCOOEt, but with an amino group at position 4. So the formula would be C7H6O2 (benzoate) plus C2H5O (ethyl ester) and NH2 (adds N and H). Let me calculate: PhCOOEt is C9H10O3 (since benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl is C2H5, so when esterified, it's C9H10O2). Wait, but with an NH2 group, that's adding another N and some H? Wait, the molecular formula would be C9H11NO3? Because the benzoate is C7H5O2, the ethyl adds C2H5O, making C9H10O3, but then adding NH2 would add N and two H, making it C9H12NO3. Which doesn't match the given formula of C9H11NO2. So
