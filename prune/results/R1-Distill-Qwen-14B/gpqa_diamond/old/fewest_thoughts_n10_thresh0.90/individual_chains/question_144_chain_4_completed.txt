Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And when they're produced, they don't live forever; they decay. The mean decay distance must have something to do with how long the meson exists before decaying and how fast it's moving.

The question gives me E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. I think the first thing I need to do is figure out the properties of the meson, like its lifetime and velocity, which will help me calculate the decay distance.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime τ of a particle is related to its decay width Γ. The formula should be τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in J·s units. So I need to convert the units properly.

Let me jot down the formula: τ = ħ / (Γ). But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants involved. I think ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh right, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant in eV·s is about 6.582e-16. So converting ħ into GeV·s would be 6.582e-25 GeV·s? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1 eV·s is 1e-18 GeV·s. So 6.582e-16 eV·s equals 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. But Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2pi) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. Then, in eV·s units, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 J = 6.242e18 eV. So ħ in eV·s is (1.055e-34 J·s) * (6.242e18 eV/J) ) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. Oh right, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 GeV·s because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s? Wait, no. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So if ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s, then in GeV·s it's 6.582e-16 / 1e9 = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Yes, correct.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25, which is 2.056875e-24 s. Right.

Now, the next part is figuring out the velocity of the meson. Because the mean decay distance is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So I need to find the velocity v of the meson.

The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV. The mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can use the energy-momentum relation to find the momentum, then find velocity from momentum and mass.

The energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since we're working in natural units where c=1, the equation simplifies to E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2).

Plugging in the numbers: E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So E^2 is 64 (GeV)^2, m^2 is 1.44 (GeV)^2. So p^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

Then, the momentum p is 7.91 GeV.

Now, the velocity v can be found from the relation p = γ m v, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But since we're in units where c=1, the relation simplifies. Alternatively, I can use the relation between momentum, energy, and mass to find beta (v/c). Remember that beta is v/c.

In natural units, the expression for beta is beta = (p c) / E. But since c=1, beta = p/E. So beta = p / E.

So beta = 7.91 GeV / 8 GeV = 0.98875. So v = beta c ≈ 0.98875 * c, which is about 0.98875 times the speed of light.

Now, the mean decay distance L is velocity multiplied by the mean lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

v is approximately 0.98875 * c, and c is 3e8 m/s. So let's compute v: 0.98875 * 3e8 ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

Then, τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So L = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating that: 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Let me compute 2.96625 * 2.056875.

Hmm, 2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325, and 2.96625 * 0.056875 ≈ approx 0.1689. So total around 5.9325 + 0.1689 ≈ 6.1014.

So L ≈ 6.1014e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16, 5e-16. So 6e-16 is not matching any options. Hmm, did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of tau.

Wait, let's double-check the calculation of tau. Gamma is 0.32 GeV, correct? ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau is 6.582e-25 / 0.32. Let me compute that again.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875. So tau is 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So yes, 20.56875e-25 s which is 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of v or p. Let's check p again.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. p^2 = E^2 - m^2. So 64 - 1.44 is 62.56, so p is sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV. Correct.

Beta is p/E = 7.91/8 = 0.98875. So v=0.98875 c.

Wait, but when you multiply v by tau, you get the distance. Let me recalculate that.

v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Wait, let's compute 2.96625 * 2.056875.

2 * 2 = 4.

0.96625 * 2 ≈ 1.9325.

2 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.11375.

0.96625 * 0.056875 ≈ let's see: 0.9 * 0.05 is 0.045, 0.06625 * 0.056875 is around 0.00378. So total around 0.04878.

Adding all together: 4 + 1.9325 + 0.11375 + 0.04878 ≈ roughly 6.095. So the product is about 6.095e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The options are A)5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm. So 6e-16 is not matching any of these. Did I miss a step?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Because beta is p/(E), which is (7.91 GeV)/(8 GeV) = 0.98875. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic gamma factor in the lifetime.

Wait, the lifetime τ is the proper time, the lifetime in the meson's rest frame. But when observed from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Oh wait! Because the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

Wait, but wait. I think the lifetime we calculated was already the proper lifetime, correct? Because tau is the mean lifetime (proper time), and when you have a particle moving, the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

Ah! So I think I forgot to multiply by gamma. That would change the calculation.

So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

So gamma is E/(m c^2), but since c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma is E/m = 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, tau is the mean proper lifetime, so the lifetime observed in the lab frame (where the meson is moving) is longer by gamma. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.

So the decay distance L = v * (gamma tau).

Ah! So I forgot to include gamma in the calculation. That's probably where I went wrong. So let's recalculate.

So L = v * gamma tau.

v is 0.98875 c ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma tau is 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.371e-23 s.

So L = v * gamma tau = 2.96625e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Let's compute that.

2.96625e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.96625 * 1.371) * 1e-15.

Compute 2.96625 * 1.371.

2 * 1.371 = 2.742.

0.96625 *1.371 ≈ let's compute 0.9 *1.371=1.2339, 0.06625 *1.371≈0.09093. So total is 1.2339 + 0.09093≈1.3248.

So overall, 2.742 + 1.3248 = 4.0668. So L≈4.0668e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5e-15. So 4.0668e-15 is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15. So the correct answer must be option B.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation of gamma tau.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.66666667.

Tau is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma * tau = 6.66666667 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

0.66666667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.37105e-24.

So total gamma tau is 1.234125e-23 + 1.37105e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then L = v * gamma tau = 0.98875c * 1.37125e-23 s.

c is 3e8 m/s, so 0.98875 *3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiplying 2.96625e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = (2.96625 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 m.

Compute 2.96625 * 1.37125.

Let me compute 2.96625 * 1.37125.

2 *1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.96625 * 1.37125.

Let me break it down: 0.9 * 1.37125 = 1.234125.

0.06625 *1.37125 ≈ 0.0909 (since 0.06625 is 1/15, 1.37125 /15 ≈ 0.091416667).

So total 1.234125 +0.0909 ≈1.3250.

Adding 2.7425 +1.3250 =4.0675.

So 4.0675e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close, probably due to rounding in the intermediate steps.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we start by calculating the mean lifetime \( \tau \) using the relation \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \). The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the velocity \( v \) of the meson. The energy-momentum relation is \( E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \), where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Solving for \( p \):

\[
p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The velocity \( v \) is related to the momentum \( p \) and energy \( E \) by \( \beta = \frac{p}{E} \), where \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \). Substituting \( p = 7.91 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875, \quad v = \beta c \approx 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by \( L = v \cdot \tau \). However, since the meson is moving relativistically, the observed lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation by a factor of \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \). Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The lab-frame lifetime is then \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \). Substituting \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

Finally, the mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = 2.96625 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.0668 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
