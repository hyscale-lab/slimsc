Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a monobasic strong acid. They want to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D with various volumes and pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 there is in moles. The formula is Fe(OH)3, so I'll calculate its molar mass. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass/molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles, approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can react with a strong acid. The reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions (from the strong acid) to dissolve completely.

So, for 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3, the required moles of H+ would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid is monobasic and strong, so it will fully dissociate. Let's say the acid is HCl (but the specific acid doesn't matter as it's monobasic). The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M. So, moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So, volume (in liters) = moles / Molarity.

Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So approximately 28.08 cm³ of acid is needed. Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that might be the volume part.

But wait, maybe I should double-check the calculations. Let me recalculate. Oh, wait, wait: Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH groups, so it would react with 3 H+ per formula unit. So yes, 3 moles of H+ needed per mole of Fe(OH)3. So that part seems correct.

Now, what about the pH of the resulting solution? Hmm. So after adding the acid, the solution will contain Fe³+ ions, and excess H+ ions from the acid. So I need to find the concentration of H+ in the final solution, then calculate pH.

Wait, but wait. How much H+ is present after dissolving Fe(OH)3?

Well, the reaction consumes some H+ to dissolve Fe(OH)3, and the remaining H+ determines the pH.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider how much H+ is added and how much is consumed. Let me think carefully.

So, the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. Wait, no, wait. The problem says that the total volume is 100 cm³, but the acid is being added, so the total volume after adding the acid would be 100 cm³. Wait, no, wait. Let me read the problem again.

The problem states: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So when I add the acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. Wait, but that can't be, because the acid itself has a certain volume. So is the 100 cm³ the final volume after adding the acid, or the initial volume before adding the acid?

Wait, the problem says, "to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?" So perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume of the solution after dissolving and adding the acid.

Wait, that makes sense. So the total volume is 100 cm³. So when I add the acid, the total volume is still 100 cm³. But wait, that would mean that the solution is 100 cm³, and the acid volume is a part of that. Hmm, that complicates things because the acid itself contributes to the total volume.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as follows: the solution is made by dissolving Fe(OH)3 in some solution (maybe water?), then adding the acid, and the total volume is 100 cm³. So, the acid volume plus the volume of the solution (after dissolving Fe(OH)3) equals 100 cm³. But I don't know the initial volume, so perhaps it's easier to treat the total volume as 0.1 L (100 cm³) for the calculations.

Wait, but perhaps the approach is to calculate the amount of H+ from the acid, subtract the amount consumed by Fe(OH)3, and find the excess H+.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

Total Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g → 0.000936 moles.

Reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, moles of H+ required: 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The strong acid (like HCl) provides H+ ions. So, the moles of HCl added would be equal to the moles of H+ needed, which is 0.002808 moles. But wait, no: because the HCl is monobasic, so 1 mole HCl gives 1 mole H+. So, same as before: moles of H+ from acid is same as moles of HCl.

Wait, but the acid is being added, and each mole gives one mole of H+. So, if I add V liters of 0.1 M HCl, the moles of HCl (and thus H+) would be 0.1 * V.

But wait, part of that H+ is consumed by Fe(OH)3. So, the H+ consumed is 0.002808 moles. The remaining H+ comes from the acid after the reaction.

But then, the total H+ present after reaction would be (H+ from acid) minus (H+ consumed by Fe(OH)3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The acid provides H+ which reacts with Fe(OH)3. So the H+ from the acid is 0.1 * V (since concentration is 0.1 M, and volume is V liters). The Fe(OH)3 takes 3 * n(Fe(OH)3) = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

So, if the acid provides H+ = 0.1 * V. Then, the remaining H+ is 0.1 * V - 0.002808.

But wait, this only works if 0.1 * V >= 0.002808. Because if the acid provides less than needed, the Fe(OH)3 won't dissolve completely. So, we need to find the minimum volume of acid that provides enough H+ to dissolve all Fe(OH)3. So, 0.1 * V ≥ 0.002808 → V ≥ 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters → 28.08 cm³. So the minimum volume is 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³, which is very close, so that's probably the correct volume.

Now, the next part is the pH of the resulting solution. After adding the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³, so 0.1 liters.

The total H+ comes from two sources: the excess H+ from the acid (0.1 * V - 0.002808) and any H+ from water. But since the acid is strong, and the solution is acidic, I think the contribution from water is negligible. So, we can approximate the [H+] as (excess H+ ) / total volume.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure.

So, moles of H+ from acid = 0.1 * V.

Moles consumed by Fe(OH)3 = 0.002808.

Excess H+ = 0.1 V - 0.002808.

But we have to make sure that this is positive, which it will be for V >= 28.08 cm³.

So, when V =28.08 cm³ (minimum), then excess H+ is 0.1 * 0.02808 L * 1000 cm³/L (wait, no: 28.08 cm³ is 0.02808 L). Wait, no, wait: 0.1 M is moles per liter. So, if V is in liters, then moles H+ = 0.1 * V.

Wait, 28.08 cm³ is 0.02808 L. So moles H+ from acid = 0.1 * 0.02808 = 0.002808 moles.

Then, excess H+ is 0.002808 - 0.002808 = 0. So, that can't be right. Wait, wait. Oh no, wait. If V is exactly 28.08 cm³, the moles of H+ from the acid is 0.002808, which is exactly the amount needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So, there's no excess H+ left. So the solution would be neutral? But that's not possible because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and the solution would have some Fe³+ ions, which are acidic. Wait, but would that affect the pH?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because, actually, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it produces Fe³+ ions, which can hydrolyze in water.

Wait, this complicates things. Because Fe(OH)3 is not a strong acid, the dissolution might not be complete, but in this problem, we're assuming it's fully dissolved with the given amount of acid. But when the acid exactly neutralizes the hydroxide, the solution would consist of Fe³+ ions in solution. These Fe³+ ions can undergo hydrolysis:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

So, this would produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So even if all the H+ from the acid is consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)3, the Fe³+ will contribute to H+ in solution.

Hmm, so maybe the pH is not zero but determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

So, let me reconsider.

If V is 28.08 cm³, which is the minimum needed, then all H+ from acid is used up in dissolving Fe(OH)3, so no excess H+ from acid remains. So the only H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

So, I need to calculate the concentration of Fe³+ and then find the pH based on its hydrolysis.

Moles of Fe³+ produced: same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 moles.

The volume of the solution is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.

So, concentration of Fe³+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Now, the hydrolysis of Fe³+:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The hydrolysis constant K can be found using the relation K = Kw / Ksp, but wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the acid dissociation of Fe³+.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions. Let's let the concentration of Fe³+ be c = 0.00936 M. The hydrolysis will produce x amount of H+.

The equation can be approximated as:

Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)+ + H+

But actually, it's more accurate to write it as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

But for the sake of simplicity, perhaps we can model it using the formula for a weak acid.

The hydrolysis reaction for Fe³+ can be treated as a reaction producing H+.

The hydrolysis constant, K, can be found from the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3.

But wait, I need to find K for Fe³+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the pH based on the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

The K for the reaction Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ can be written as:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But I don't remember the exact K or Ksp for Fe(OH)3. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, I think the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is around 6e-38 at 25°C. Let me confirm: yes, Fe(OH)3 has a Ksp of approximately 6.0e-38.

Wait, but Ksp is for Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 OH^- (aq).

So, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But when Fe^3+ undergoes hydrolysis, the reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. 

So, the K for this reaction would be Kw / Ksp.

Because, the hydrolysis reaction can be thought of as the reverse of the dissolution into OH-.

Wait, more accurately, the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 OH^- (aq); Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6.0e-38.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is the reverse of that, but in aqueous solution, it would produce H+ ions:

Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3 H+ (aq).

But the equilibrium would depend on the K for this reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)^+ + H+.

But this is a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the hydrolysis of a metal ion to produce H+.

The pH can be estimated using the formula:

pH = (pKw - pKsp) / 2.

Wait, let me think. Let me recall that for a salt of a weak acid and strong base, like Fe(OH)3, which is a base, but when dissolved in water, it can hydrolyze to produce OH- ions. But in this case, we're adding H+ to dissolve it, so perhaps the solution is acidic, and Fe^3+ is hydrolyzing to release H+.

Wait, but perhaps the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as a weak acid. Let me find the K for that.

Alternatively, using the Ksp, perhaps I can find the [OH^-] when Fe^3+ is in solution, and then find [H+].

Wait, when Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in an acidic solution, the OH- concentration is low. So, perhaps the standard Ksp is not the right approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the solution after adding the exact amount of acid needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So, the Fe(OH)3 is just completely dissolved, and the solution contains Fe^3+ ions.

But since Fe^3+ is a weak acid, it will hydrolyze, releasing H+.

So, the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M in 0.1 L (100 cm³).

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression for K is:

K = [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]^1.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is 1. So, K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But what is K for this reaction?

Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the solubility in terms of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the hydrolysis constant, K_h, for Fe^3+.

The K_h for Fe^3+ can be calculated using Kw / Ksp.

Wait, let's think about it.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-; K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

In acidic solution, the OH^- is low, so Fe^3+ can hydrolyze to produce H+.

The reverse reaction for the dissolution would be:

Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s).

So, the K for this reaction is 1/K_sp = 1.666e37.

But when in acidic solution, the OH^- is low, so Fe^3+ tends to hydrolyze.

The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction can be found by combining the reverse dissolution with the autoionization of water.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the concentration of H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Let me denote the concentration of Fe^3+ as c = 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is 1, so:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

We can find K from the K_sp of Fe(OH)3 and the ion product of water.

The dissolution equation is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-; K_sp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s); K = 1/K_sp = 1/(6e-38)
