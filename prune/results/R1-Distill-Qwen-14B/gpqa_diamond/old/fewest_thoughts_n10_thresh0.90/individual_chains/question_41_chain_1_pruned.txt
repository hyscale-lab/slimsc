Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving relative to an observer. Hmm, I need to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer in the lab. Let's see, what do I remember about this topic?

Wait, the question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is also moving in the same direction as the glass. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer. Interesting.

I remember that when media are moving, the speed of light within them isn't simply additive like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because light is an electromagnetic wave, and its speed in a medium depends on the medium's properties, specifically the index of refraction.

The index of refraction n is given by n = c / v_glass, where v_glass is the speed of light in the glass in the medium's rest frame. So in the glass, light normally travels at v_glass = c/n.

But here, the glass is moving. So I think this is a case where we need to apply a transformation similar to the Doppler effect, but for light in a medium. Or maybe it's about how the speed of light is observed in a moving medium.

Wait, I remember something about the relativistic Doppler effect, but does that apply here? Or is it more about how the velocity of the medium affects the observed speed of light?

Alternatively, perhaps this is a problem that can be approached using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving relative to the lab frame, and the light is moving in the glass, which is itself moving.

Wait, let me think. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_glass = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Oh yes, the velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity in the first
