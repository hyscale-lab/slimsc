Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, that's an interesting relation. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various power laws, so I think I need to relate parallax to distance and then see how the number of stars scales.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if parallax plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa. So, if the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5, substituting plx in terms of d would help.

Let me write that down. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So replacing plx in the equation N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 becomes N ∝ (d)^5. But wait, wait. Let me double-check. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, then substituting plx = 1/d gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Which is the same as N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, I see. So the number per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to d. Because number per unit distance is N'(d), which is the change in number per change in distance.

So if N = k * d^5 (where k is a constant), then the derivative N' with respect to d is 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with d^4. But wait, the options are in terms of r, not d. Oh, wait, the question says 'per unit range of distance r', so I think r is the variable here, and perhaps d is r. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the notation. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. It's saying the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, that makes the number proportional to distance^5. But then, when considering how the number changes with distance, per unit distance, we're probably looking at the rate of change. So, taking the derivative of N with respect to d. So N ∝ d^5, so dN/dd = 5d^4, which would mean the number per unit distance increases with d^4. Wait, but the options don't have d, they have r. So I think the correct answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another approach: sometimes, when we talk about the number of stars as a function of distance, we're considering the volume. But here, the problem says that the number varies with 1/plx^5, which isn't volume dependent. So perhaps this is a more direct relation.

Wait, let's think about the relation between parallax and distance. Parallax plx in arcseconds is equal to 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So plx = 1/d => d = 1/plx. So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, that is N = k * (plx)^(-5) = k * (1/plx)^(-5) = k * plx^(-5) = k * (1/plx)^5 = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5.

But the question is about the change in the number of stars with distance. So the number per unit distance is the derivative. So dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number per unit distance increases with d^4. So the answer would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?". Oh, so per unit distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance is d^4. So the answer would be ~ r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is just asking for how N scales with distance, not the derivative. Wait, but the question says "change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm, that wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the derivative, i.e., the change per unit distance, or is it about the total number in a range of distance? Let me re-read the question.

The question says, "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?".

So, per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's considering the number of stars within a thin shell at distance r, with thickness dr. So the number of stars in a shell would be the surface density multiplied by the surface area of the shell. But wait, perhaps I'm mixing up with other concepts.

Wait, but originally, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx is proportional to 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. So if you have a range of distance dr, the number of stars in that range would be the derivative of N with respect to r. So dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4, so the answer is option C.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: if N = k d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance is the rate of change, which is 5 k d^4. So per unit distance, the number increases with d^4. Therefore, the correct option is C, which is r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we can write \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( d^5 \).
