Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm.

Alright, let's break it down. First, the initial setup: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, both are the same volume. When you mix equal volumes, the concentration should decrease by half, right? Because concentration is moles per liter, and when you double the volume, the concentration halves. So, initial concentration after dilution would be 0.025 M. Let me confirm that: 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So moles are same, 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's see, the moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So, moles of NaOH needed would also be 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it means 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So when titrating, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, I need to find the pH at this 25% point and at equivalence.

Starting with the 25% titration point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. Let's calculate the moles. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, moles of acetic acid (HA) will decrease by 0.00025 mol, and moles of acetate (A⁻) will increase by same amount.

Initial moles HA: 0.001 mol (after dilution). So moles HA after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles A⁻: 0.00025 mol. The total volume now is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[A⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). The pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.735 (since Ka is 1.85e-5, pKa is about 4.73).

So pH = 4.735 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) ≈ 4.735 + log(0.333). Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258. So approximately 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, what about the equivalence point pH?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. The volume: initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ NaOH, so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. So concentration of A⁻ is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is A⁻ + H2O ↔ HA + OH⁻. The Kb can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is small, so we can approximate the hydrolysis. The expression is Kb = [HA][OH⁻]/[A⁻]. Let x be [OH⁻].

So Kb ≈ x² / (0.02) → x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29e-6, pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486. pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514. So approximately 8.51. Looking at the options, option A has 8.52, which is close.

So the first pH is ~4.26, the second ~8.51. So the option should be A.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option D is 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, no. Option A is pH 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the right pair.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. Since 0.001 mol of acetic acid is present, the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

For the 25% titration point, 25% of the equivalence point volume (2.5 cm³ of NaOH) is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid (HA)} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion (A⁻)} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A⁻}]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.735\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.735 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) \approx 4.735 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.735 - 0.477 = 4.258 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of acetate ions in water is governed by:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

The equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{A⁻}]}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{A⁻}] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
