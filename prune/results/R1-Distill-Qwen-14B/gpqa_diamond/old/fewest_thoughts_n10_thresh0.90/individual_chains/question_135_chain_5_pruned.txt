Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh right, probably it's L = -λ (something) ψ̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ(y), but the exact form isn't crucial for the decay modes, I think. The important part is that X is interacting with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, the possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

I remember that for a particle to decay into two particles, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, X can decay into a pair of fermions if 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

So first, let's list the possible fermions and their masses. I think the known elementary fermions and their approximate masses are:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): about 105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but I'm not sure if they're considered here, but probably not because the problem is about decays into charged leptons or quarks.

Wait, but the problem is about the allowed decays, so X can decay into any fermion pair as long as their combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. But the actual decay possibilities depend on whether the interaction allows for that.

Wait, the Lagrangian has X interacting with fermions. So, which fermions can X decay into? The interaction term must allow X to couple to fermion-antifermion pairs.

Looking at the Lagrangian: L = -λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, I think the term is probably something like L = -λ X ψ̄ ψ, because v is a constant, so the X field must be multiplying the ψ̄ ψ term. So, the interaction term would be something like X ψ̄ ψ. So X can couple to any fermion ψ as long as the coupling is allowed by the symmetry.

So, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass condition is met. So the possible fermions are all the quarks and leptons, except for the top quark, which is too heavy.

So, the possible decay products are pairs of:

- Quarks: u, d, s, c, b (but top is too heavy)
- Leptons: e, μ, τ (nu is very light, but perhaps not considered here as decay products because they're neutral and maybe the interaction is via charged currents? Or perhaps the X couples to charged leptons.)

Wait, but the X has a mass of 6 GeV, so let's calculate the maximum possible mass of a single fermion in a pair.

Since X is 6 GeV, the sum of the two fermion masses must be ≤6 GeV.

Let me list each fermion's mass and see:

Electron: 0.511 MeV → 0.000511 GeV. So 2 * 0.000511 is negligible. So X can decay into e+ e-.

Same with muon: 0.1057 GeV. 2 * 0.1057 = 0.2114 GeV <6 → allowed.

Tau: 1.78 GeV. 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV <6 → allowed.

Quarks:

u: ~2 MeV → 0.002 GeV. 2m = 0.004 <6 → allowed.

d: ~4.7 MeV → 0.0047 GeV. 2m ~ 0.0094 <6 → allowed.

s: ~95 MeV → 0.095 GeV. 2m ~0.19 <6 → allowed.

c: ~1.3 GeV. 2 *1.3 = 2.6 <6 → allowed.

b: ~4.5 GeV. 2 *4.5 =9 GeV>6 → Not allowed. So b quark is too heavy for X → b bbar.

Wait, but wait: X is 6 GeV. If each b is 4.5 GeV, then 4.5*2=9>6. So X can't decay into b bbar.

So possible quark pairs are u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait: X is 6 GeV. What about the c quark? 2*1.3 is 2.6, which is much less than 6. So X can decay into c cbar.

But what about top quark? X is 6 GeV, and top is 173 GeV. So even if X could couple to top, which it can't because top is way heavier, but 2*173 >>6, so no.

So possible quark decays are u, d, s, c.

But wait, the options given in the problem don't include some of these. Let me look at the options.

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau -, e+ e-.

But wait, b is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9>6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau -, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So for B, the fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but what about tau? 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV <6 → allowed.

So that's okay.

What about c? 2 *1.3 =2.6 <6 → allowed.

So B includes c, which is allowed. So B seems possible.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau -, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, b is too heavy, but D includes it. So D is incorrect.

So the correct options are which include only fermions whose 2m_f <=6 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are:

u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

Wait, wait, but what about the possible of the X to decay into a pair of heavy quarks but in combination with lighter ones? Oh, no, for each decay, X would have to decay into a specific pair. So for each decay, the sum must be ≤6 Ge
