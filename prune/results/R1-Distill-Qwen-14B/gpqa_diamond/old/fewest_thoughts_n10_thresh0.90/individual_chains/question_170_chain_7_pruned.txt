Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means the spinor is a two-component vector. So, the state vector χ is [3i, 4] transposed. Or maybe it's written as a column vector. Right, in quantum mechanics, spin states are represented as column vectors in a two-dimensional complex space because electrons are spin-1/2 particles.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Oh right, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. The spin operators are given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli y-matrix.

The Pauli y-matrix σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, let me write that out:

σ_y = 
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

But wait, the problem statement shows σ_y as a matrix with 0, -i in the first row and i, 0 in the second. Yep, that's correct.

So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. Therefore, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by S_y multiplied by the state vector. So I need to compute χ† S_y χ.

The state vector χ is [3i, 4]. Let me write it as a column vector:
χ = [ 3i
       4 ]

Wait, is the state given as (3i,4) a row vector or a column vector? I think in this context, it's a column vector because spinors are column vectors. So χ is (3i, 4) as a column.

Wait, actually, in notation, when someone writes (a,b), it's often a row vector. But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are column vectors. Hmm, maybe the state is given as a row, so perhaps the conjugate transpose is needed. Wait, maybe I should represent χ as a column vector.

Wait, perhaps the state is written as a row vector, so χ = [3i, 4], and the conjugate transpose χ† would be [3i*, 4*] as a row. Let me think: if χ is given as a row (3i,4), then χ is a row vector, so χ† would be a column vector with the conjugate entries. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. Let's assume that the state χ is a column vector. So χ is [3i; 4], and χ† is [3i*, 4*] as a row vector. But wait, 3i is a complex number, so its conjugate is -3i. So χ† would be [-3i, 4], because 4 is real, so it stays the same.

Wait, 3i is a complex number. Its complex conjugate is -3i? No, wait. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Let me think. No, wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i? No, wait, 3i is 0 + 3i, so its conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i. Hmm, yes.

So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the expectation value is χ† S_y χ. So let's compute that.

S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Let me compute S_y χ first. Let's compute that matrix multiplication.

S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i; 4 ]

Let's compute the matrix multiplication step by step.

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*3i + 0 = 3i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

First component of S_y χ:

Row 1 of S_y is [0, -i].

Multiply by χ: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second component: Row 2 is [i, 0].

Multiply by χ: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y χ is (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, we need to compute χ† multiplied by S_y χ. χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† S_y χ = [ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ]

Let me compute the matrix product [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ].

First component: (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but wait, that's the product of the row vector and the column vector, which gives a scalar. So χ† S_y χ = (-24) * (ħ/2) ?

Wait, no. Because S_y χ is (ħ/2) multiplied by the vector [ -4i; -3 ]. So when I compute [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3
