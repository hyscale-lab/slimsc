Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. And we're supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with various ratios.

Wait, first, I need to recall what the pp-III branch is. I know that the proton-proton chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun's core. The pp-I branch is the main one, where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton fuses to form helium-3 and two protons. The pp-II branch is another part where a helium-3 captures a proton to form carbon-12. And pp-III? Oh right, that's when two helium-3 nuclei combine to form helium-4. Or wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think. The pp chain has two main branches: the main one (pp-I) and the pp-II, where I think the main branch produces helium-4, and the pp-II produces boron-8, which then decays into other things. Hmm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is probably a minor contributor. Oh, right, I remember that the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus captures a helium-3 to make helium-4 and two protons, but that's supposed to be a minor part of the Sun's fusion.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III reactions are a part of the proton-proton chain, so stopping them would affect the production of certain particles, particularly neutrinos.

I remember that neutrinos are produced mainly in the Sun through the decay of boron-8, which is a byproduct of the pp chain. But wait, the main neutrino-producing processes are the beta decays in the pp chain. Like, when boron-8 decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. Also, other reactions in the pp chain produce neutrinos, such as the decay of other isotopes.

Wait, but in the proton-proton chain, the primary neutrino emission comes from the decay of boron-8, which is a charged pion-like decay, emitting a neutrino. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the main neutrinos come from the decay of helium-3 or other isotopes, but I think it's more about boron-8. Wait, no, actually, in the pp chain, when a proton captures a proton to form deuterium, the deuterium can then capture another proton to become helium-3, which can either combine with another helium-3 to form helium-4 (pp-I, main branch) or capture a proton to form boron-8 (pp-II branch). Boron-8 is unstable and decays into carbon-8, which emits a neutrino. So the pp-II branch is a minor part of the solar fusion, but it's the primary source of boron-8, which is a major source of solar neutrinos.

If the pp-III branch stops, but all other reactions remain the same, then what's affected? Well, the pp-III is a part of the main pp chain. Wait, or is it a separate process? Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The pp chain has the main branch (pp-I) where two protons fuse stepwise to form helium-4, and the pp-II branch where a helium-3 captures a proton to form boron-8, which then decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. The pp-III branch is perhaps another process, but perhaps I'm mixing up the branches here.

Wait, another thought: the pp-III branch might refer to a specific reaction pathway. Let me think about the first few steps. The initial step is two protons fusing to form a deuterium nucleus, releasing a positron and a neutrino. So that's a neutrino from the start. Then, the deuterium can capture another proton to form helium-3, which can then either combine with another helium-3 (main pp-I branch) or capture a proton (pp-II branch) to form boron-8.

So in the pp-I branch, two helium-3 nuclei combine to form helium-4, which doesn't directly produce a neutrino. But in the pp-II branch, the boron-8 decay does produce a neutrino. So the neutrino flux from the pp-II branch is significant.

Now, the question is about when the pp-III branch stops. If pp-III is another branch, perhaps involving higher energy reactions or different products. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III refers to a specific part of the reaction chain, like when a helium-3 nucleus captures a helium-3 nucleus to make helium-4 and two protons. But wait, I think that that's the main pp-I branch, so maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is a specific neutrino-producing process. For example, in the pp chain, the first reaction produces a neutrino: p + p → 2p → d + e+ + ν_e. So each time two protons fuse, they produce a neutrino. So that's the first source of neutrinos. Then, in the decay of boron-8, which is from the pp-II branch, another neutrino is emitted. So perhaps the majority of solar neutrinos come from the first reaction (pp-I) and the pp-II reaction.

If the pp-III branch is another process, maybe there's a third source of neutrinos. Or perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the neutrino flux. So if we stop the pp-III branch, the neutrino flux would decrease in certain energy ranges.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So what neutrinos are produced in the pp-III branch? If the pp-III branch is a specific part of the chain, maybe that's where higher-energy neutrinos are produced. So if that part stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the energies. The neutrino energies from the Sun are in the range of about 200 keV to a few MeV. The question's bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So these are in the higher end of solar neutrino energies.

The main source of high-energy neutrinos is the decay of boron-8, which emits around 1.4 MeV neutrinos. Oh wait, wait. Boron-8 has a half-life of about 8 seconds, and when it decays into carbon-8, it emits a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is about 1.4 MeV. But wait, 1.4 MeV is 1400 keV. So band 2 is up to 900 keV, which is lower than 1.4 MeV. Hmm, that's a problem because if the neutrinos are higher than 900 keV, they would be in a higher band.

Wait, but
