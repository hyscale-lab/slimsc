Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and quantum models. Hmm, I need to figure out what momentum a photon should have so that when the molecule absorbs it, it moves to the next lowest energy state. Alright, let's start breaking it down.

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, isn't the rigid rotor model where the bond length is fixed, and the non-rigid allows for some stretching? Oh right, so this model accounts for both rotation and vibration.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state in quantum mechanics usually refers to the lowest energy state. So for a diatomic, I think that would be the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So the vibrational state is n=0 (the lowest) and rotational state is also the lowest, maybe j=0 or j=1? Wait, no, the ground state for rotation is j=0, I think. Because rotational energy levels start at j=0.

Wait, or is the rotational quantum number j starting at 0, and the vibrational starts at n=0 as well? So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state.

The question asks for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state after the fundamental? Oh, I think the next would be the first excited state overall. But wait, the system has both vibrational and rotational energy levels. So the energy levels are a combination of both.

I remember that the energy for a diatomic molecule can be considered as the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib. So the fundamental state is when both are at their lowest: E_rot (j=0) and E_vib (n=0). The next lowest energy state would be the one where either the vibrational or rotational state is excited by one quantum.

But wait, which transition gives the lower energy? Because photons have energy proportional to their frequency, so the energy difference between states depends on which transition occurs. So what's lower: promoting rotation or vibration?

Well, vibration has a much higher frequency than rotation. Because the vibrational frequency is given as w = 4e14 rad/s, which is in the visible or UV range. The rotational frequency would be much lower. Because the rotational energy levels are spaced by delta E = B (rotational constant) times (j(j+1)), where B is h/(8π²I c), I think. But wait, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia.

Hmm, perhaps the next higher energy state is the first rotational state, j=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be the first vibrational excited state, n=1, but that would require a much higher photon energy.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the states are characterized by quantum numbers j and n. The energy levels are given by E(j, n) = E_rot(j) + E_vib(n). The ground state is j=0, n=0. The next possible states are either j=1, n=0 or j=0, n=1. Which of these transitions has the lower energy difference?

The vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħw, while the rotational energy levels are spaced by B j (j+1), where B is the rotational constant. Let's calculate both and see which one is lower.

First, compute B, the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is given by B = (h)/(8π² I c), wait, no, I think it's actually B = ħ²/(2I), but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the selection rules. Alternatively, I might remember that the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B j (j+1), where B is h/(8π² I c), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is given by μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length. So let's calculate μ first.

The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) amu. So plugging in the numbers:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.66 = approximately 3.01. So 3.01e-27 kg.

Moment of inertia I = μ r². Bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So r squared is (2e-10 m)^2 =4e-20 m². So I = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then the rotational constant B is given by B = h/(8π² I). Wait, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Alternatively, the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * j(j+1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Hmm.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (j(j+1) * ħ²) / (2I). So the spacing between j and j+1 is the difference in energy between j+1 and j.

So for j=0 to j=1: the energy increases by (1*2 - 0*1) * (ħ²/(2I)) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE_vib = ħw.

So let's compute both the rotational energy difference (E_rot) and the vibrational energy difference (E_vib) and see which is smaller.

Compute E_rot for j=1 (transition from j=0 to j=1):

ΔE_rot = E_rot(j=1) - E_rot(j=0) = [1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)] * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but wait, E_rot(j) = [j(j+1)] * ħ²/(2I). So the difference between j=1 and j=0 is [2 - 0] * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, okay, so E_rot difference is ħ²/(I).

Now compute ħ²/(I):

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ² ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/I ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ approximately 9.23e-23 J.

Now compute E_vib = ħw. w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħw = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So comparing the two: E_vib is about 4.2e-20 J, E_rot is 9.23e-23 J. The rotational transition requires a lower energy photon. So the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon
