Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get pretty tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the 1 and 3 positions of this structure.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are heated with a base, it's usually an elimination reaction. So I think the bromides are leaving, and the molecule undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, maybe both are eliminated. But wait, where are the bromines located? If they're on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would form a double bond. But if they're on positions that allow for a conjugated diene or something else, maybe a different structure forms.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Since adamantane is a diamondoid, the structure is quite rigid. Eliminating both bromides would probably form a diene. But wait, another possibility is that each elimination forms a double bond, but since they're on 1 and 3, perhaps the double bonds are conjugated? Or maybe the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a single double bond. Hmm.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But the NMR spectrum has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an -OH group, maybe as an enol? Or maybe it's an ether or something else. Alternatively, 4.79 is usually around where an alcohol proton would be, but it's 2H, so maybe it's an -OCH₂- group. Wait, but 4.79 could also be adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, the product after KOH heating is probably an elimination product. Wait, but if two bromides are eliminated, maybe forming a conjugated diene? But then why the IR peak for a carbonyl? Oh wait, another possibility: maybe it's an E2 elimination to form a ketone. Wait, no, E2 elimination typically forms alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually involves amines. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. If KOH is a base, but in this context, perhaps it's dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Wait, wait, maybe it's a di-elimination to form a ketone. Wait, how? If two bromide groups are on adjacent carbons, eliminating both could form a carbonyl. Let me think. For example, each Br leaves, and each adjacent C forms double bonds, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination leads to each CH2Br becoming a CH, but that would form a double bond between the two carbons. But then the product would have a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a neighboring group participation. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, and then perhaps some rearrangement occurs. Alternatively, maybe the two eliminations result in the formation of a ketone. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the NMR data.

The NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), that's a singlet? Maybe. Then, 2.41-2.23 (10H), which is a multiplet. And 1.94 (2H). So, let's think about the structure.

If product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a diketone or a ketone. Wait, but the IR is at 1720, which is around where a ketone's C=O would be. So maybe the product is an adamantyl ketone.

Wait, but how do two bromides lead to a ketone? Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of ring expansion or contraction. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a position where elimination would form a ring with a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH could undergo a double elimination. Each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbons form double bonds. But that would produce a diene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination leads to each losing H and Br, forming a double bond. But that's double elimination, forming two double bonds? No, more likely, each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H to form a double bond. But in that case, the product would be a diene. However, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings; the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent in some way. Wait, perhaps the two bromines are on bridgehead carbons. If I eliminate both, maybe the two bridgehead carbons lose Br and form a carbonyl. Wait, but bridgehead carbons can't form double bonds because of Bredt's rule. But maybe they form carbonyls.

Wait, if each bridgehead has a Br, and upon elimination, each bridgehead would lose H and Br to form a carbonyl group. So, that would lead to two ketone groups? So the product would be 1,3-diketone adamantane. But wait, the IR would show two peaks around 1720, but the description says a characteristic absorbance, so maybe one strong peak. Alternatively, perhaps only one of the Br is eliminated, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, another thought: when elimination occurs, perhaps one Br leaves, and the other Br also leaves, but in a way that forms a conjugated diene. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a single double bond, but then the product isn't a carbonyl. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the NMR. 4.79 ppm is about where an -OH group might be, but it's 2H. Or maybe it's an -OCH2- group, perhaps from an epoxide, but I don't see how that would form. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but again, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, another angle: if the product has an ester group or a carbonyl. For example, if the reaction forms a ketone. Let's say each Br elimination leads to the formation of a ketone. But how? Each Br is on a carbon that's adjacent to another Br. So when KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, perhaps both Br's are eliminated, and the adjacent carbons each form a double bond to oxygen, leading to two ketones. But that would require the adjacent carbons to each lose a Br and a H, which is possible. So the product would be 1,3-adamantanedione.

The NMR would then have the carbonyl carbons, but the protons... Wait, the NMR shows 4.79 (2H). If the product is a diketone, where would the protons be? Adamantane is a diamondoid, so the structure is pretty rigid. The 4.79 ppm could be from some adjacent protons. Wait, perhaps the product isn't a diketone but something else.

Alternatively, maybe instead of elimination, the reaction is a substitution. But KOH is a base, and in substitution, especially SN2, but with a rigid structure like adamantane, SN2 might not be feasible for both Br's. So more likely elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, the IR would show two strong peaks around 1720, but maybe they're overlapping, appearing as a single peak. The NMR would have the carbonyl regions, but the 4.79 ppm is something else. Perhaps the 2H at 4.79 are adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, 1,3-diketone adamantane would have two ketone groups. The structure would be adamantane with two ketone groups at 1 and 3 positions. The NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyls. Let's think: the carbons next to ketones would be deshielded, so their protons would be around 2.1-2.5 ppm, as in the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm is higher, so maybe it's a different environment. Alternatively, maybe there's a bridge or some other structure.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 ppm is an -OCH2- group. But how would that form? If it's an elimination, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a neighboring carbon, leading to the formation of an epoxide. But with KOH, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's move to the next step.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Heating with this, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so it's not aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's a Lewis acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps an acid-catalyzed rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: aluminum isopropoxide is often used in the formation of enol ethers or in some types of alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration step.

Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl group. When treated with a strong Lewis acid like Al(OR)3, perhaps it's a Claisen or aldol condensation. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition.

Wait, but product 1 is a diketone. So when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a Baylis-Hillman type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps aluminum isopropoxide acts as a strong Lewis acid, promoting the formation of an enol from the ketone. Then, maybe a conjugate addition or some type of cyclization occurs.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane, and heating with Al isopropoxide leads to a Dieckmann cyclization, which is an intramolecular esterification. But wait, that would require ester groups, which aren't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the two ketone groups undergo some kind of cyclization to form a cyclic diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the Lewis acid facilitates the formation of enolates, leading to some kind of aldol addition. But without a carbonyl that can be added to, maybe it's a cross aldol between the two ketones in the same molecule.

Hmm, maybe the product 2 is a cyclic diketone or an enol ether.

But perhaps I should think about the next step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically cleaves it into carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But product 3's NMR would then show the new protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

But wait, product 2 is the result of product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide. So product 1 has a carbonyl group, and product 2 might have a double bond.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, then product 2 could be a dienone, perhaps with a conjugated diene. Then ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyls.

But how does product 2 get a double bond? Maybe during the reaction with Al isopropoxide, product 1 rearranges to form a conjugated dienone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would break into smaller fragments.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to piece it together.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming elimination, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione (two ketones). So the structure would have two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 3.

IR of product 1: strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which fits a ketone.

NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H, singlet?), 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet), 1.94 (2H, maybe a triplet or something else).

Wait, 2.4-2.2 is around where methine or methylene groups next to carbonyls would be. So perhaps the 10H are from the adamantane structure, perhaps the adjacent carbons to the ketones.

The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a bit confusing. Maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but why would that form from a diketone?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, could it be a cyclic hemiacetal? But that's less likely under basic conditions.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not a diketone but a single ketone. Let me think again.

If only one Br is eliminated, that would form a single ketone. But why would the other Br remain? Or perhaps it's a different mechanism.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a single elimination to form a diene, but then how does the IR show a carbonyl?

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's move to the second step.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts, but since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's involved in some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Alternatively, Al isopropoxide may help in the formation of an enol from the ketone, leading to some kind of conjugate addition or cyclization.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is a conjugated dienone. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

But getting back to the problem, maybe it's better to think about the overall reaction.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So let's think: product 1 is a diketone. Product 2 is a dienone (a conjugated diene with ketones), formed via some kind of [Al-catalyzed] reaction. Then, ozonolysis cleaves the diene into two carbonyl groups, resulting in product 3.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps in a structure that's smaller than adamantane.

Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3, focusing on the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange, like -OH). The coupling pattern of this hydrogen.

Wait, in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each end forms a carbonyl. So if the diene was in a ring, the cleavage would break the ring and form two carbonyls.

Assuming product 2 is a dienone, let's imagine that the diene is between two ketones. Ozonolysis would break the diene into two separate carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyls, maybe in a chain.

But with the adamantane structure, perhaps the diene was part of a bridge, and ozonolysis would break it into smaller rings or chains.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene was part of a bridge, and ozonolysis would split the molecule into two ketone-containing fragments.

Wait, but given that the initial structure is adamantane, which is a four-ring system, breaking a bridge would result in a smaller molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a transannular double bond, leading to a bridge that, when cleaved, forms a diketone.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic structure with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to a straight chain with two ketones.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the NMR of product 3.

The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl groups. So in product 3, which has carbonyl groups, the adjacent protons would be deshielded.

In ozonolysis, the product often has carbonyl groups at the sites where the double bond was. So each carbonyl is on a carbon that was part of the double bond.

So, the structure after ozonolysis would have two carbonyls. Let's imagine product 3 is a diketone with a chain, perhaps something like O=C-(CH2)n-C=O.

The protons adjacent to the carbonyls would be around 2.1-2.4 ppm, but the most deshielded would be the ones closest to the carbonyl.

Wait, in a diketone, the protons next to the carbonyls are typically split into multiplets due to coupling with neighboring protons. But the most deshielded would be the ones next to the carbonyl, so perhaps a triplet or doublet.

Wait, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2 would have a triplet or quartet, but the protons adjacent to the carbonyl (the CH2 next to C=O) would be a triplet because each is split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the middle CH2 would be a quartet, and the end CH2 would be a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The protons closest to the carbonyl would be the most deshielded.

So, in O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be a quartet, but perhaps the end protons are a triplet.

Wait, but in such a structure, each CH2 group is between two others. The end CH2 (next to C=O) would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Or no, wait. Let's say it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O.

Each CH2 group is connected as follows:

C=O - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - C=O

So the middle CH2 is between two CH2 groups, so its protons would be a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a triplet. Alternatively, each CH2 could be a quartet if coupled with adjacent CH2 groups.

But wait, maybe the structure is more complex. Let's think about product 3. After ozonolysis, product 2 (which had a double bond) is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two ketones or two carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone with a chain, the structure would be something like:

O=C-(CH2)m-O-C=(O) ?

No, wait, ozonolysis typically gives carbonyl groups, so maybe:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O

But more accurately, the ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. So if the diene was in a bridge, perhaps the structure becomes a chain with two carbonyl groups at each end.

In such a case, the protons adjacent to the carbonyls would each be split by their neighboring protons.

Wait, but considering the coupling patterns, the end CH2 would have only one neighboring CH2 group, so their protons would be a quartet (if each CH2 has two protons). Wait, no. Wait, for a CH2 group next to another CH2, each proton on the first CH2 is split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each proton would be a triplet.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. Wait, that's not relevant. Let's take a simple example: (CH2)n where n=2. So O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

Each CH2 group has two protons. Each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2.

The end CH2 groups (the ones next to the C=O) are each connected to a single CH2. So for each proton on the end CH2, how are they split?

Each end CH2's protons are next to the middle CH2. Each middle CH2 has two protons. So each proton on the end CH2 would be split into a triplet by the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in reality, each CH2 group is a triplet because each is next to a CH2 group with two protons. Wait, no. For a CH2-CH2 group, each CH2's protons are split by the neighboring CH2. So the first CH2 (left end) would be a triplet
