Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The direction is arbitrary and lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, the operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for a component along an arbitrary direction is a combination of the Pauli matrices. The general form is P = ħ/2 (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But wait, in this problem, P is given for each component, P_x, P_y, P_z. But wait, the problem says that the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so n is in x-z. That means n_y is zero. So, the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Wait, wait, if it's in the x-z plane, then the angle is measured from the z-axis, so it's similar to polar coordinates with θ from the z-axis. So the components would be n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. But since it's in x-z, φ is 0 or π? Wait, no—wait, if it's in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π, because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to φ=0 or π. So, φ is zero for the x direction, and π for the negative x. But wait, maybe I don't need to worry about φ because the operator is along n, which is in x-z. So, the operator P would be (P·n) = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But wait, no, actually, the operator P is given along n, so P is equal to n·σ multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, let me get back to the problem.

The question says that the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator P is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) because n_y is zero. Because n is in x-z, so n_y =0.

Wait, but the given components are P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So the operator P along n would be (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Because n_y is zero.

Wait, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no: The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but actually, since the operator P along n is (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z), but n_y is zero here. So it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z = (ħ/2) I (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), where I is the identity matrix.

So the operator is (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). And the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (1) * |ψ>.

Because when you factor out the ħ/2, the equation becomes (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (1) |ψ>.

So, the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) must have eigenvalue +1.

What's σ_x and σ_z?

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, the matrix becomes:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Wait, because for σ_x: [[0 1],[1 0]], times n_x gives [[0, n_x],[n_x,0]]. For σ_z, times n_z gives [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]]. So adding them together, the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

We're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +1.

So the equation is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T.

Which gives two equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a - n_z b = b.

Let's rearrange the first equation:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

Similarly, the second equation:

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

So, we have a system:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

We can write this as a matrix equation:

[ (n_z -1),     n_x          ] [a]   = [0]

[     n_x,   (-n_z -1)      ] [b]     [0]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant must be zero.

The determinant is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

Which is:

(- (n_z -1)(n_z +1) ) -n_x^2 = -(n_z²-1) -n_x² = -(n_z² + n_x² -1).

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1.

So the determinant is -(1 -1) = 0. So any solution is non-trivial, so we can find a non-zero solution.

So, from the first equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0. Let's solve for a in terms of b, or vice versa.

Let me express a as (n_x b) / (1 - n_z). Wait, because:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b => a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

But n_z -1 = -(1 -n_z), so a = [n_x / (1 -n_z)] b.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to find a ratio between a and b.

Let me write a = k b, where k is the ratio.

Substitute into first equation:

(n_z -1) k b + n_x b = 0.

Divide both sides by b (assuming b≠0):

(n_z -1) k + n_x =0 → k = -n_x/(n_z -1).

So, a = [-n_x/(n_z -1)] * b.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe instead, let's think about the eigenvector.

Alternatively, since the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], and the eigenvalue is +1, we can find the eigenvectors.

Another approach: The eigenvectors are along the direction of the operator. Wait, the operator is along n, so perhaps the eigenstate is aligned with n, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The eigenvalues of the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] are sqrt(n_z^2 + n_x^2), but wait, no. Let me compute the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues λ of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, -a]] would satisfy:

The characteristic equation is (a - λ)(-a - λ) - b² =0.

Which is (-a² - λ² + λ a - λ a) - b² =0 → -(a² + λ²) -b²=0 → λ² = -(a² + b²).

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me recompute:

Wait, the matrix is:

|a b|
|b -a|

The eigenvalues are solutions to:

(a - λ)(-a - λ) - b² =0.

=> (-a^2 - a λ + a λ + λ²) - b² =0.

Wait, expanding: (a - λ)(-a - λ) = -a² - a λ + a λ + λ² = λ² - a².

So equation becomes λ² - a² - b² =0.

Thus, λ^2 = a² + b².

But in our case, a is n_z, b is n_x.

So λ^2 = n_z^2 + n_x^2. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so λ^2=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

Therefore, the eigenvectors correspond to the eigenvalues +1 and -1.

We're interested in the eigenvalue +1.

So, back to the equation for the eigenvector when λ=1.

We have:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

And,

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

But we can use the first equation to express a in terms of b.

From first equation: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

But n_z is part of the unit vector in x-z plane. So n_z is, say, cosθ, n_x is sinθ, since n is in x-z, n_y=0. So let me parametrize n as:

n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into a:

a = [ -sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps that's messy, but maybe we can find a ratio.

Let's express a = k b, as before.

So k = -n_x/(n_z -1) = -sinθ/(cosθ -1).

Let me rationalize this expression. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by (cosθ +1):

k = [ -sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / [ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) ) ].

Denominator becomes cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

So,

k = [ -sinθ (cosθ +1) ) ] / (-sin²θ )

Simplify negatives:

k = [ sinθ (cosθ +1) ) ] / ( sin²θ )

= (cosθ +1) / sinθ.

Which is (1 + cosθ)/sinθ = cot(θ/2). Because 1+cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so (1+cosθ)/sinθ = [2 cos²(θ/2)]/[2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = cot(θ/2).

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [cot(θ/2) b, b]^T. Let me factor out b:

b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

But we need to normalize the eigenvector. So, the components are a and b, which are proportional to cot(θ/2) and 1.

But let's compute the normalization:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(θ/2)|^2 + 1 = (cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2)) +1 = [cos² + sin²]/sin² = 1/sin²θ/2.

Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, [cot(θ/2)]² + 1 = (cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2)) / sin²(theta/2) ) = 1/sin²(theta/2).

So the norm is sqrt(1/sin²(theta/2)) ) = 1/ |sin(theta/2)|.

So to normalize, divide each component by [1/sin(theta/2)].

So the normalized eigenvector is:

( sin(theta/2) * cot(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So:

a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So when b is sin(theta/2), then a is cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, in this case, we had a = [cot(theta/2)] * b, which is [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * b.

If b is sin(theta/2), then a is cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

Wait, let me look at the options.

Option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

But wait, the options have hbar factors? No, the options are:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But the question is about the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector is [a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, the given options have some with sqrt factors.

Wait, let me think again. Oh, because sometimes in quantum mechanics, the spin states are normalized, but in this case, after the calculation, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options:

Option C) is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D) is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the eigenvector isn't necessarily scaled by ħ. Because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector. The operator has dimensions of ħ, but the eigenvector is a state vector, which is dimensionless. So ħ wouldn't be part of the eigenvector components.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the options include hbar in some, like option A and D have sqrt(2/3) ħ, etc. So why would the eigenvector have hbar? That doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are state vectors, which are dimensionless. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the operator P is given with components multiplied by ħ/2. But the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, so its components should be dimensionless. So the normalized eigenvector shouldn't have ħ in them. So options A and D have ħ, which would be incorrect.

Thus, the correct option must be C, which has no ħ. So the answer should be option C.


To calculate the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are expressed as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction vector is $(n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is then:

\[
\vec{P}_{\vec{n}} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P}_{\vec{n}} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]

Solving the first equation for $a$ in terms of $b$, we find:

\[
a = \frac{-n_x}{n_z - 1} b.
\]

Using the parametrization $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the ratio $a/b$ becomes:

\[
a = \frac{-\sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1} b = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor. The components are proportional to $\cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$ and $1$, so the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include $\hbar$, which is not part of the normalized eigenvector, as eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **B** is not consistent with the derived form of the eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
