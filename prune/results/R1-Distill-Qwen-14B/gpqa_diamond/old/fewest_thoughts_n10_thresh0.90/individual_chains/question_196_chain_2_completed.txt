Okay, so I have this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is related to the amplitude and the spring constant. Oh right, the formula is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², which converts into kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max² at the equilibrium point. So that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so we can't use the classical formula directly.

Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in a relativistic oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but I'm not sure how the potential energy plays into this.

Wait, the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. In the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the equations of motion are different. Hmm, I'm trying to recall. Oh right, the relativistic harmonic oscillator's equation is more complex because the force isn't just kx but also involves relativistic momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use energy conservation. At the maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero (since it's at rest at that point). As the mass moves to the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't the same as classical.

Wait, but wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So, the total mechanical energy (which includes potential and kinetic) must equal the rest energy plus kinetic at the equilibrium point.

Wait, let me think again. At position x = A, the oscillator is at rest, so all the energy is potential. At x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So, the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, E is gamma mc². Hmm, but wait, the rest energy is mc², so the kinetic energy would be E - mc². But if E is (1/2)kA², then (1/2)kA² = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, that's not right. No, wait, the total energy should be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So at x=A, the mass is at rest, so total energy E is (1/2)kA² = mc², because at x=A, it's not moving, so kinetic energy is zero. But wait, that can't be right because (1/2)kA² is the potential energy, which would be equal to the total energy in the classical case. So in the classical case, E = (1/2) k A² = (1/2) m v_max², giving v_max as sqrt(kA²/m).

But in the relativistic case, when the mass is at x=0, its speed is maximum, so all the energy must be in kinetic energy. So the total energy E is (1/2) k A² = gamma mc², because E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, the total energy is gamma mc², but in this scenario, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and when the particle is at x=0, the potential is 0, so the total energy is just the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) mc². But that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the total mechanical energy in the oscillator is (1/2)kA², which in the relativistic case is equal to the total energy at x=A, which is mc². So (1/2)kA² = mc². But that can't be right because if A is such that (1/2)kA² equals mc², then kA² would be 2mc². But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to set the total energy (relativistic) equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement. So at maximum displacement, the mass isn't moving, so its total energy is purely potential energy. So E_total = (1/2)kA².

But the total energy in relativity is gamma times mc squared. So, (1/2)kA² = gamma mc². But wait, at x=A, the mass is at rest, so gamma is 1 because v=0. So that would imply (1/2)kA² = mc². Hmm, but that would mean that the maximum potential energy is equal to the rest energy, which seems restrictive. I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is equal to both the potential energy at maximum displacement and the kinetic energy at equilibrium. So E = (1/2)kA², and also E = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, no. Because at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so E is just the potential energy, which is (1/2)kA². And in that case, the total energy is (1/2)kA². But when the particle is at x=0, it's moving at maximum speed, so its total energy is gamma mc². So, (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

But wait, when the particle is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is the kinetic energy plus the rest energy. So, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², and the total energy is gamma mc². So, E = (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

So, solving for gamma, gamma = (kA²)/(2 mc²). Wait, because (1/2)kA² = gamma mc² → gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * (1/2)kA²? Wait, no, let's redo that.

If E = (1/2)kA² = gamma mc², then gamma = ( (1/2)k A² ) / ( m c² ) = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c²) = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Hmm, wait, solving for v_max.

Let me write that equation again:

gamma = (1/2)kA² / (m c²) )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) ) = (k A²) / ( 2 m c^2 )

Take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = 2 m c^2 / (k A^2 )

Now square both sides:

1 - (v_max^2/c^2) = (4 m² c^4) / (k² A^4 )

Then,

v_max^2 / c^2 = 1 - (4 m² c^4 )/( k² A^4 )

Wait, that doesn't look like any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Maybe I can't use the same energy considerations because the system is relativistic. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator.

The equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator is more complicated. The force is F = -k x, but the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. So,

F = d p / dt = d/dt (gamma m v )

So,

m d/dt (gamma v ) = -k x

But x is the position, which is related to velocity through the equation of motion. This seems complicated because gamma depends on v, which depends on x. I'm not sure if this is the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps using the virial theorem in relativity. The virial theorem relates the average kinetic and potential energies. In the classical case, the average kinetic energy equals the average potential energy, but in relativity, this might not hold.

But I'm not too familiar with the virial theorem in relativity, so maybe that's not the way.

Wait, going back to the energy approach. Suppose the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is the classical potential energy. But in the relativistic case, when the mass is at x=0, its speed is maximum, so the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc² + 0 (since potential energy is zero at x=0)

Wait, but that would mean that the potential energy at x=A is equal to the kinetic energy at x=0. But wait, in the classical case, the potential energy is converted into kinetic, but in the relativistic case, it's not exactly the same because of the way kinetic energy is defined.

Wait, perhaps the total energy, which is gamma mc², equals the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy (which is (gamma - 1) mc²). So when at x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is just the potential energy, which is (1/2)k A². So,

gamma mc² = (1/2) k A² + (gamma -1) mc²

Wait, that seems confusing. Let me write it again.

At x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is just (1/2)k A². But E is also gamma mc². So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² → gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

At x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma_total - 1) mc². Wait, but the total energy is the same as before, E = gamma mc².

Wait, but that would mean gamma mc² = (gamma -1) mc² + 0 → which would imply gamma = gamma -1, which can't be right. Oh, wait, that's a contradiction. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the total energy is equal to the rest energy plus the potential energy, but that doesn't make sense either. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternative approach: let's think about the speed at maximum displacement. Wait, no, maximum speed is when the oscillator passes through equilibrium (x=0). So perhaps I should express v_max in terms of the amplitude A and the spring constant k, considering relativistic effects.

In the classical case, v_max = sqrt( (k A²)/m ). But in relativity, the velocity can't reach c, so the maximum speed would be lower than that, but wait, depending on the parameters, perhaps it could approach c.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is the classical formula, so it's probably not the correct relativistic one. So the correct answer is either A, B, or D.

Looking at the options, option A has a sqrt(1 + ...), which might suggest a velocity that's a significant fraction of c. Option B has a similar form with 1/(1 - ...), and option D has sqrt(1 - ...), which would imply a velocity less than c, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, considering that the energy E is (1/2)kA², and E is gamma mc², so (1/2)kA² = gamma mc² → gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But for v_max, the speed is maximum when x=0, so the velocity is v_max, and gamma is as above.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, 1 - v_max²/c² = (2 m c²)/(k A² )

So,

v_max²/c² = 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A² )

Wait, but that would mean that v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A²) )

But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Hmm. Maybe I did a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-do the steps.

E = (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

So gamma = (1/2) k A² / (m c² )

So,

gamma = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Wait, but this can't be correct if the denominator is small. For example, if (k A²) is much larger than 2 m c², then gamma would be very large, but that would require v approaching c.

Wait, but in the equation, if (k A²)/(2 m c²) is greater than 1, then gamma would be greater than 1, which is possible. Let me see.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 2 m c^2 / (k A² )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m² c^4) / (k² A^4 )

→ v^2/c^2 = 1 - (4 m² c^4)/(k² A^4 )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them seem to match this form. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the energy isn't (1/2)kA². Maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy is different. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But in relativistic cases, perhaps the potential energy is different. Alternatively, maybe the oscillator's equation of motion includes relativistic terms, leading to a different potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the energy conservation in terms of the total energy, which includes both potential and kinetic.

Wait, when x is maximum (x=A), the oscillator is at rest, so total energy is potential energy plus rest energy. So,

E_total = (1/2)k A² + m c^2.

But when x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum, so,

E_total = gamma m c^2.

Setting them equal,

gamma m c^2 = (1/2)k A² + m c^2 → gamma = [ (1/2)k A² + m c^2 ] / (m c^2 )

= ( (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ) + 1.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as some term, say, α. So,

gamma = 1 + alpha → alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + alpha.

Let me solve for v^2/c^2.

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + alpha )

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + alpha )^2 → v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ]

= [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 - 1 ) → 2 alpha + alpha²

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha )^2 = alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )^2

But alpha is (k A² )/(2 m c² ), which is probably small compared to 1 for most cases, but not necessarily always.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none match this expression. Let me see the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m) ) )

Wait, but the denominator in the fraction inside the sqrt is (1 - (k A²)/(2 m) ), which would be 1 - alpha * (c²)/(A²?) Hmm, not sure.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

So, 1/(1 - alpha )

Wait, because alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, option B has 1 + 1/(1 - alpha ), which is 1 + [1/(1 - alpha ) ]

Which is ( (1 - alpha ) + 1 ) / (1 - alpha ) ) → (2 - alpha )/(1 - alpha )

Hmm, not matching the expression I have.

Wait, but in my calculation, v^2/c^2 = [ alpha (2 + alpha ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as:

v/c = sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha ) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

But how does that relate to the options?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy approach. Let's go back.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the total energy as the sum of rest energy and the potential energy. So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is the potential energy plus the rest energy.

In the classical case, potential energy is (1/2)k A², so E = (1/2)k A² + m c².

But wait, in the classical case, the total energy would be the sum of potential and kinetic. But when you're at maximum displacement, the kinetic is zero, so E = (1/2)k A². But in relativity, perhaps the rest energy is separate, so E = (1/2)k A² + m c².

So, when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So,

E = (gamma -1 ) m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

So,

gamma = [ (1/2)k A² + m c^2 ] / ( m c^2 )

= (1/(2 m c^2)) k A² + 1

= 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Which brings us back to the same gamma expression as before. So, gamma = 1 + alpha where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm. So, the v_max is calculated as before.

But that leads to v^2/c^2 = 1 - (1/(1 + alpha )^2 )

Hmm. Let's compute:

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ]

= [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha²

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha )^2

= alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )^2

Hmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of (1/(1 - ... )).

Wait, let's factor the denominator:

(1 + alpha )^2 = [ (1 + alpha ) ]^2.

But perhaps there's a way to write this expression as (something) squared.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write v_max = c * sqrt( something )

Looking at the options, option B is sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which would be sqrt( [ (1 - a ) + 1 ] / (1 -a ) ) where a = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is sqrt( (2 - a )/( 1 - a ) )

Hmm, not matching my expression.

Option A: sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - a) ), where a is (k A^2)/(2 m )

But wait, in option A, the denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ) ), which is (1 - a mc^2 / c^2 ), because a = (k A^2)/(2 m )

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: maybe the correct expression is option B because when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is small, the v_max approaches the classical value. Because in the classical case, v_max = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is option C. So, in the non-relativistic limit, when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small (like <<1), let's see what option B gives.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

If (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small, then 1/(1 - a ) ≈ 1 + a. So,

sqrt( 1 + 1 + a ) = sqrt( 2 + a )

But that would make v_max ≈ c * sqrt(2 +a )

But the classical v_max is sqrt(k A^2/m ) = sqrt(2 ( (k A^2)/(2 m ) ) )

Hmm, but that doesn't match. So perhaps option B isn't the right one. Alternatively, perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, the correct expression would approach the classical one.

Let me see my expression:

v_max^2/c^2 = [ alpha (2 + alpha ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2, where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

If alpha is small,

v_max^2/c^2 ≈ [ alpha * 2 ] / 1 → 2 alpha

So v_max ≈ c* sqrt(2 alpha ) = c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) )

= c * ( A sqrt(k/m ) ) / c )

= sqrt( k A^2 / m )

Which is the classical result, option C. So that's good.

Looking back at the options, which one would yield the same in the non-relativistic limit.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

In non-relativistic limit, (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small, so denominator ≈ 1 -a.

So 1/(1 -a ) ≈ 1 + a → 1 + 1/(1 -a ) ≈ 2 + a.

So v_max ≈ c * sqrt(2 + a )

But when a is small, sqrt(2 + a ) ≈ sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 + a/2 ) ≈ sqrt(2) (1 + a/(4) )

But this doesn't approach the classical v_max of sqrt(k A²/m ) = sqrt( (k A^2)/( m ) )

Hmm, perhaps option B isn't the correct one then.

Looking at option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ) ) )

Wait, in this case, the denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ) ), which for non-relativistic case, when (k A^2)/(2 m ) is small, 1/(1 - a ) ≈ 1 + a.

So, 1 + 1/(1 -a ) ≈ 1 + 1 + a → 2 + a.

So again, v_max ≈ c sqrt(2 + a )

But the classical v_max is sqrt(k A²/m )

Which is sqrt( (k A^2)/( m ) )

So if (k A^2)/(2 m ) is a, then a = (k A^2)/(2 m )

So 2 + a = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m )

But sqrt( 2 + a ) * c would not approach sqrt(k A^2/m )

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this for small a.

If a is small, then 2 + a ≈ 2 (1 + a/(2) )

So sqrt(2 + a ) ≈ sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 + a/(2) ) ≈ sqrt(2) (1 + a/(4) )

So v_max ≈ c * sqrt(2) (1 + a/(4) )

But the classical v_max is sqrt(k A^2/m ) = sqrt( (2 a m ) / m ) ) = sqrt(2 a )

Wait, wait, no. Because a = (k A^2)/(2 m )

So sqrt(k A^2/m ) = sqrt( (2 a m ) / m ) * sqrt(1/2 )

Wait, perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere. Maybe I should instead focus on the correct approach, which is to set the total energy equal to the rest energy plus potential energy at maximum displacement, and then find v from gamma.

So, with E = (1/2)k A^2 + m c^2 = gamma m c^2.

So, gamma = ( (1/2)k A^2 + m c^2 ) / (m c^2 )

= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + 1.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Now, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Taking reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 - 1 ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) - 1

= 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m^2 c^4 )

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2/(m c^2 )) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps this can be factored in terms of the denominator.

Denominator is (1 + a )^2, where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

Numerator: 2 a m c² * (k A²/(m c² )) = ?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator.

Wait, the numerator becomes:

(k A^2)/(m c^2 ) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] 

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) (1 + a )

Wait, because a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so 1 + a is in the brackets.

So,

Numerator = (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) (1 + a )

Denominator = (1 + a )^2 

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2/(m c^2 )) (1 + a ) ] / (1 + a )^2 )

= (k A^2/(m c^2 )) / (1 + a )

= a * 2 / (1 + a )

Because a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so 2a = (k A^2)/(m c^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 a )/(1 + a )

= 2 a / (1 + a )

So,

v_max/c = sqrt( 2 a / (1 + a ) )

Which is,

sqrt( 2 (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

= sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2 ) * [ 1 / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] )

Hmm, but none of the options match this exactly.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - a ) )

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, let me compute what each option gives for v_max/c.

Option B's expression inside the sqrt is 1 + 1/(1 - a ), where a = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 + 1/(1 - a ) = ( (1 - a ) + 1 ) / (1 - a ) ) = (2 - a )/(1 - a )

So,

Option B gives v_max/c = sqrt( (2 - a ) / (1 - a ) )

But according to my calculation, v_max^2/c^2 = (2a )/(1 + a )

So,

v_max/c = sqrt( 2a/(1+a ) )

Which doesn't match any option directly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy approach. Maybe the total energy is just the sum of the potential and kinetic, but in relativity, the potential is different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy in the relativistic case is (1/2) k x² / gamma. Because relativistic mass increases with speed, so the potential energy might depend on gamma. Hmm, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) k x^2, and the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, another approach: the total energy in relativity is E = gamma m c^2, which is the sum of rest mass (mc²) and kinetic energy (gamma mc^2 - mc^2).

In the classical oscillator, the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that's converted into kinetic energy at x=0.

But in relativity, perhaps the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc².

At x=0, the potential is zero, so the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)kA².

So,

Kinetic energy = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)k A^2

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which brings us back to the same gamma expression as before.

Thus,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) - 1

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Let me factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) from denominator:

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= 2 a / (1 + a ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 2 a / (1 + a ) )

Which can be written as:

v_max = c * sqrt( 2 a ) / sqrt(1 + a )

But looking at the options, none of them match this exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I can manipulate this expression further. Let me see:

2a/(1+a) = [ 2 (a) ] / (1 + a )

= [ 2 ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) * [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ]

Hmm, but how does that relate to the options?

Looking again at option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) )

Which is sqrt( (2 - a )/(1 -a ) )

Hmm, which is different from what I have.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: (1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(gamma^2 )

Wait, wait,

gamma^2 = (1 + a )^2

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + a )^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 

= [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2 

= [ 2a + a^2 ] / (1 + a )^2 

Which is what we have.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v^2/c^2 = [2a (1 + a/2 ) ] / (1 + a )^2 

But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write the expression under the square root in option A and see.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m )) )

Hmm, so the term inside sqrt is 1 + 1/(1 - a ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m )

So,

1 + 1/(1 - a ) = ( (1 -a ) + 1 ) / (1 -a ) ) = (2 -a )/(1 -a )

Hmm, which is different from our expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that (1 + a )/(1 - a ) is a common term.

Wait, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely because the question expects one of them to be the answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in considering the energy. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is (d/dt)(gamma m v) = -k x.

But x is related to velocity via the equation, which is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the angular frequency is different in relativity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the maximum speed can be found by considering the point where acceleration is zero. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression for maximum speed is v_max = sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m) ) / sqrt( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Wait, because in the classical case, v_max is sqrt(k A^2/m ), so in relativity, we might have a denominator with a relativistic correction.

Wait, that would be v_max = sqrt( (k A^2/m ) (1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

But that's not among the options either.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 - a )/(1 - a ) ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but according to my earlier calculation, v_max^2/c^2 is (2 a )/(1 + a )

So,

(2 a )/(1 + a ) = [ 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) 

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy approach, and the correct expression is option A.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible choices again.

The problem is a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law F = -k x. So it's likely that the potential energy is still (1/2)k x^2.

The maximum speed occurs where all the potential energy is converted into kinetic, but relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1 ) m c².

So,

(1/2) k A^2 = (gamma -1 ) m c^2

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as before.

Thus,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which leads to,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Looking at the options, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c* sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches exactly.

Wait, no, I thought option D was 1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2.

Let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I derived.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct expression was option B, but perhaps I was mistaken.

Wait, no, in my calculation, v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + a )^2 ]

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct answer must be option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in the non-relativistic limit, the result would approach the classical value. Let's check that.

In the non-relativistic limit, (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is very small, so a <<1.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2a )

= 2a

So,

v_max ≈ c*sqrt( 2a ) = c* sqrt( 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) )

= sqrt( k A^2 / m )

Which is the classical result.

So option D gives the correct non-relativistic limit.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), spring constant \( k \), and maximum amplitude \( A \), we use energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the mass is momentarily at rest, so the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]  
   At \( x = 0 \), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. The total energy is also equal to the relativistic kinetic energy:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Equating the two expressions for \( E \):  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \), substitute \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Finally:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Non-Relativistic Limit**:  
   In the classical limit where \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \), the expression reduces to the classical result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), confirming the correctness of the relativistic derivation.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**.  

Answer: D
