Okay, so I've got this quantum field theory problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ and determining if the theory is renormalizable. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. 

Wait, I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of fields and coupling constants is important for renormalizability. The idea is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions. Because that implies that the interactions are of lower dimension, making the theory manageable in perturbative calculations.

So, first I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I think I should figure out the mass dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime (d^4 x), and the action is dimensionless, so the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So, let's break down the term κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me list the fields involved here. ψ is a spinor field, F is the field strength tensor, and σ is built from gamma matrices which are dimensionless.

Wait, the field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from a gauge field, which in QED is a vector field A_mu. The field strength is defined as F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ + i e [A^mu, A^nu] or something like that. But for mass dimension purposes, each A_mu has dimension 1 because the covariant derivative is ∂_mu + i e A_mu, and ∂_mu has dimension 1. So the terms in the covariant derivative must have the same dimension, so A_mu has dimension 1.

Then, F^{μν} is the derivative of A, so each derivative is dimension 1. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the field A_mu has mass dimension 1. So each derivative acting on A would give dimension 1 + 1 = 2. Because ∂_mu has dimension 1, and A_mu has dimension 1, so ∂_mu A^nu has dimension 2. So F^{mu nu} is dimension 2.

Now, the sigma_{mu nu} is (i/2)[gamma_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so sigma is dimensionless. So each sigma is just a matrix, no mass dimension.

So, the term in the Lagrangian is κ times ψ̄, multiplied by sigma_{mu nu}, multiplied by ψ, multiplied by F^{mu nu}.

Let me think about each part's dimension. Let's figure out the dimensions of each part: ψ̄, ψ, and F.

The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, the Dirac equation is (i∂/ - m)ψ = 0. The ∂/ has dimension 1, so mψ must have dimension 1. So ψ has dimension 3/2 (since m is dimension 1, ψ is 3/2). So ψ̄ (the adjoint) also has dimension 3/2.

F^{mu nu} has dimension 2, as we said earlier.

Now, the term ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ has each part: ψ̄, σ_{mu nu}, ψ.

Each ψ̄ and ψ is 3/2. σ is dimensionless, so the product ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

So the term [ψ̄ σ ψ F] is [3] multiplied by [2] (from F). So the whole thing is dimension 5.

But wait, the Lagrangian term L_int has to have dimension 4. Because when you integrate L over d^4x, the action is dimensionless. So each term in L must have dimension 4.

So the entire term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] +5.

But this must be equal to 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable? Well, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Because coupling constants with negative dimensions would require an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Here, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let me check the dimensions again.

Wait, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let me recount: ψ is 3/2, ψ̄ is 3/2, F is 2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. F is 2. So 3 + 2 =5. So κ must be dimension -1 to make the term dimension 4. Okay, that's correct.

So the coupling κ has [κ] = -1. Which is negative, so the theory is not renormalizable.

So looking at the options:

Option A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because negative dimension implies non-renormalizable.

Option B) [κ]=1, ren. No, because the dimension is wrong.

Option C) [κ]=-1, not ren. Yes, this fits.

Option D) [κ]=1, not ren. No, because κ's dimension is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4, as the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 in 4-dimensional spacetime. Breaking it down:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.
- $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

Thus, the total dimension of $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

To ensure the interaction term has dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the dimension of $\kappa$ is wrong.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as it matches the analysis.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the dimension of $\kappa$ is wrong.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
