Okay, so I have this physics problem here. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So, the isotope would be Li-6 because it has 3 neutrons. Lithium normally has 3 protons, so the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The goal is to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of this nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic energy equations.

Wait, what's the formula for relativistic energy? Oh right, the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = γmc². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v. So gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²).

So first, let's calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Plugging into the formula, 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Hmm, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/(28/100) is 100/28, which is approximately 3.5714286. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The problem statement doesn't give this directly, but I know that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 u. So 6 nucleons, approx 6 u.

Wait, but maybe I should check the exact mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as 6 times the mass of a proton. Or perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6, but since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with the approximation.

Wait, but let's think about the standard value for the atomic mass. One atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So the rest mass energy would be mc². So for the Li-6 nucleus, m = 6 u. So m = 6 * 1.66054e-27 kg ≈ 9.96324e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that: 6 * 1.66054e-27 = 9.96324e-27 kg.

Then, mc² would be 9.96324e-27 kg multiplied by (3e8 m/s)^2. Let's compute that. 3e8 squared is 9e16 m²/s². So 9.96324e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = (9.96324 * 9) * 1e(-27 +16) ) = 89.66916 * 1e-11 → 8.966916e-10 J. Wait, but the energy is usually expressed in electron volts (eV) or GeV for such problems. So I need to convert that to eV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So, to convert from joules to eV, we divide by 1.60218e-19.

So, 8.966916e-10 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = (8.966916 / 1.60218) * 1e9 eV.

Calculating 8.966916 / 1.60218 ≈ 5.6 (let me compute more accurately: 1.60218 times 5 is 8.0109, 5.6 times 1.60218 is 5 * 1.60218 =8.0109, 0.6 *1.60218=0.9613. So 8.0109 + 0.9613 = 8.9722. Close to 8.9669, so around 5.597? Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 8.966916 / 1.60218:

1.60218 *5.597 = ?

Well, 5 *1.60218=8.0109. 0.597 *1.60218 ≈ 0.5 *1.60218=0.80109, and 0.097 *1.60218≈0.1554. So 0.80109 +0.1554 ≈0.9565. So 5*1.60218=8.0109, plus 0.9565 gives 8.9674. That's very close to 8.966916. So that gives 5.597 approximately.

So 5.597e9 eV is the rest mass energy. Wait, 5.597e9 eV is 5.597 GeV.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 6 u is 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 9.963e-27 kg.

m c² = 9.963e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

So (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

Multiply by 9.963e-27 kg: 9.963e-27 *9e16 = 8.9667e-10 kg·m²/s² = 8.9667e-10 J.

Convert to eV: 8.9667e-10 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = (8.9667e-10) / (1.60218e-19) = (8.9667 / 1.60218) * 1e9.

As I calculated earlier, 8.9667 / 1.60218 ≈5.597.

So, rest energy is about 5.597 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused because I thought the mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c². So 6 protons would be about 5.628 GeV. Oh, that's close to the 5.597 I just got. Wait, perhaps because I used the exact value of 1 u being 1.6605e-27 kg and calculating from that. Alternatively, I might have made an error in the approximation.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², which is 0.938 GeV. So 6 protons would be 6 * 0.938 = 5.628 GeV. So my calculation gives approximately 5.597 GeV, which is slightly lower. Hmm, maybe the mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6 u. Because the actual mass of Li-6 is about 5.999 u? Wait, wait, no, I think that's not correct. Wait, let me think: the atomic weight of Li-6
