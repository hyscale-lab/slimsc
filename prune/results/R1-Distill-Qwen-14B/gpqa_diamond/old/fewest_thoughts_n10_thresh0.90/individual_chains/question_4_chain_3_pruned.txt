Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, Maxwell's equations—right, they're the four fundamental equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate. 

Wait, in our universe, magnets can't have isolated poles; you always have a north and south pole together. So if in another universe, magnets could have single poles, that would change things. How does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Let me recall each of Maxwell's equations. The first is Gauss's Law for electricity: divergence of E equals rho over epsilon. That's about electric fields and charge distribution. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B is zero. That's because in our world, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so the magnetic field lines are continuous, forming closed loops. 

If there were isolated magnetic poles, like magnetic charges, then divergence of B wouldn't be zero. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So that equation would change. 

The third equation is Faraday's Law of Induction: the curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. That relates changing magnetic fields to electric fields. I don't think this equation changes because it's more about induction and not about the origin of the fields. 

The fourth equation is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: the curl of H equals the current density plus the displacement current. This equation deals with how magnetic fields are generated by currents and changing electric fields. Again, this shouldn't directly be affected by the presence of magnetic monopoles because Ampère's law is about how magnetic fields circulate due to currents. 

Wait, but wait. Maxwell's equations as we know them are based on the absence of magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, then the second equation (divergence of B) would change. Also, I think there's another equation that would come into play for the magnetic equivalent of Gauss's Law. So, in the presence of magnetic charge, another equation would be added or modified.

Wait, but the question is about how Maxwell's equations look different. The options are about which equations are different. So in our equations, only the second equation (div B =0) would change. But wait, maybe there's another equation that changes.

Wait, let me think again. Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles would have both divergence of E and divergence of B terms. So the two Gauss laws would have sources: div E = rho_e / epsilon, and div B = rho_m / mu (or something like that). 

So previously, the equation for div B was zero. Now, it would have a source term. So that equation (the second equation) changes. Also, are there any other equations that change?

Faraday's Law (third equation) is about the curl of E. If there are magnetic monopoles, perhaps the time derivative of B isn't the only source of E. Or maybe not, because the curl of E is about the circulation, not about divergence.

Wait, no. The curl of E is about the rotation or circulation of the electric field, which is related to changing B fields. So I think Faraday's Law wouldn't change.

Wait, but wait. If magnetic monopoles exist, then maybe there's a dual to Ampère's Law. So the fourth equation is curl H = J + dD/dt. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps the equation would have an additional term. But Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition is about how changing E fields contribute to the curl of H. If there are magnetic currents (like a current of magnetic monopoles), then perhaps the equation would also have a term involving the time derivative of E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a new equation is introduced, but the question says Maxwell's equations look different, so perhaps two equations are modified.

Wait, Maxwell's equations consist of four equations. If magnetic monopoles exist, then both Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law might change. Let me think. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B would not be zero, so equation 2 changes. Also, perhaps the curl of E would change. Because without magnetic monopoles, curl E is minus dB/dt. But if there are monopoles, perhaps there's a magnetic current term as well. 

Wait, I think in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations would be symmetric. So for each equation dealing with E, there's a corresponding one for B. So:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon
2. div B = rho_m / mu
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (magnetic current?) [Not sure]
4. curl B = mu (J_e + epsilon dE/dt)

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the modified equations would add terms for magnetic charge and current. 

Another approach: in our universe, the equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B
