Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. They've given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is like how nearby stars appear to move against more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. Oh right, the formula I remember is that distance is roughly proportional to 1 over parallax. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

So the question says the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1 / plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I need to find how N changes with distance, say r. So if plx is inversely proportional to r, then plx = k/r, where k is some constant. Wait, or is it plx = 1/distance? I think the formula is distance (in parsecs) is approximately 1 over the parallax in arcseconds. So d ≈ 1/plx. So plx is 1/d.

So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So if I substitute plx in terms of d into the equation for N, then N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that.

1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), and the reciprocal is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but wait—no, wait. The original expression is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So if plx is inversely proportional to d, then 1/plx is proportional to d. So plx = k/(d), so 1/plx = d/k. 

Wait, let's make it more precise. Let me write it mathematically. Let's say plx = 1/d. So, substitution into N: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5.

So (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), and 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. That would mean that the number of stars is proportional to the fifth power of the distance. But wait, the question is about how the number of
