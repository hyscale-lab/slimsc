Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The problem states that these spots cause brightness variations as the star rotates, which could mimic the effect of an exoplanet. The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Hmm, so I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to what an exoplanet would cause. Wait, when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So for the exoplanet scenario, the signal amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2, right?

But the spots are causing a variation too. Since spots are cooler, when they're on the visible side (as the star rotates), the star appears a bit dimmer. The filling factor is 20%, meaning that 20% of the affected hemisphere is covered by spots. So I need to calculate the total brightness variation from the spots and compare it to the planet's effect.

Wait, the problem says that the star's hemisphere is covered with spots, which have a filling factor of 20%. So filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. So for one hemisphere, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. But wait, the hemisphere is half the star's surface, so the total area covered is 0.2 * (π R^2) * 0.5? Or is the filling factor just 20% of the hemisphere's area?

Wait, the filling factor (f) is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if one hemisphere is covered, and the filling factor is 20%, then the area of spots is f * (π R^2 / 2), because the total surface area is 4π R^2, so a hemisphere is 2π R^2. Wait no, a sphere's surface area is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So, the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, wait. If the filling factor is 20%, that's the fraction of the entire surface covered by spots. Oh wait, no, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so I think the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (Area of hemisphere). The hemisphere's area is 2π R². So spots area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

But wait, wait another moment. Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface? No, the question says "one hemisphere is covered", and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So yeah, the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area), which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But the spots are cooler. So when they're on the facing side, the star's brightness is reduced. The brightness variation would depend on the temperature difference and the area of the spots.

The star's total luminosity is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. When the spots are on the visible side, the effective temperature of that area is lower. So the change in luminosity would be the difference between the original and the spotted area.

The spot temperature is Teff_spot = Teff - 1000K = 5000 K. So the flux from the spots is lower.

The total flux without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are on the visible side, the flux is L = L0 - (flux from spots) + (flux from the rest of the star's surface). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux when the spots are visible.

The area of the spots is A = 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Each spot's flux is σ T_spot^4. So the total flux without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

With spots, the flux from the spots is A * σ T_spot^4.

The rest of the star's surface (non-spots) is (4π R² - A) * σ (6000)^4.

So the total flux becomes:

L = [ (4π R² - A) * σ (6000)^4 ) ] + [ A * σ (5000)^4 )

So the change in luminosity ΔL is L - L0 = [ (4π R^2 - A) σ T^4 + A σ (T-ΔT)^4 ] - [4π R^2 σ T^4 ]

Which simplifies to:

ΔL = -A σ T^4 + A σ (T-ΔT)^4

= A σ [ (T - ΔT)^4 - T^4 ]

Then, the fractional change in luminosity is ΔL / L0.

Wait, but L0 is the total flux without any spots, which is 4π R² σ T^4. So:

ΔL / L0 = [ A σ ( (T - ΔT)^4 - T^4 ) ] / (4π R² σ T^4 )

Simplify this:

= [ A ( (T - ΔT)^4 - T^4 ) ] / [4π R² T^4 ]

Substituting A = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So,

= [ (0.4 π R²) ( (5000)^4 - (6000)^4 ) ] / [4π R² (6000)^4 ]

Let me compute this.

First, the R² and π terms will cancel.

So,

= [0.4 (5000^4 -6000^4 ) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

Compute 5000^4 and 6000^4.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 5^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625e12.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1296e12.

So 5000^4 - 6000^4 = 625e12 - 1296e12 = -671e12.

So,

= [0.4 * (-671e12) ] / [4 * 1296e12 ]

Simplify:

= (0.4 * -671) / (4 * 1296) ) * (e12 / e12 ) → units cancel.

Compute numerator: 0.4 * -671 = -268.4.

Denominator: 4 * 1296 = 5184.

So,

= (-268.4) / 5184 ≈ -0.0517, approximately.

So the fractional change is about -5.17% (negative because the spots make it dimmer).

Wait, but the question says that the brightness variation due to the spots will resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the spots is about 5.17% dip. Alternatively, the maximum dip is about 5.17%, but depending on how the spots are positioned, perhaps the variation is smaller? Wait, no, since the spots are on one hemisphere and the star is rotating, the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully facing us. But the problem states that one hemisphere is spotty, so as the star rotates, the spots come into view and go away, causing the brightness to dip when spots are visible and rise when they're not. So the amplitude would be the fractional change in brightness, which is about 5.17% as calculated.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the fractional change I calculated is the total change when the spots are all facing us. But when the star rotates, the spots would come into view over time, so the brightness variation would be a sinusoidal curve with an amplitude of about 5.17% dip. But actually, the problem says that the brightness variation is caused by rotational modulation, which would be a periodic change. But in reality, the maximum dip would be when the entire spot is in front, so the amplitude would be that 5.17% dip.

But wait, earlier I computed ΔL/L0 as approximately -0.0517, which is a 5.17% decrease. So the maximum dip is about 5.17%.

Now, the problem states that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So, when an exoplanet transits the star, it blocks a certain area, causing a similar dip. The dip's amplitude would be (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar² (but wait, no, the star's area is 4π Rstar², but the exoplanet is only covering a small part, so the fractional area is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area of the planet is π Rp², and the area of the star is π Rstar² (the cross-section). So the fractional area is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

So if the transit depth (amplitude) is (Rp/Rstar)^2, then we set that equal to the fractional dip from the spots, which is about 0.0517.

So,

(Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, that's about 0.227. But looking at the options, the options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Hmm, but wait I'm not matching any of these. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me check my calculation steps again.

First, the area of the spots: hemisphere is 2π R². So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Right.

Then ΔL = A [ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) ].

Wait, no, wait. The flux from the star without spots is:

Each area element dA emits σ T_eff^4. When it's a spot, it's σ (T_spot)^4.

So the change in flux is (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) * dA.

So when the star is fully observed, the change is A (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) * σ.

Wait, but the star's total flux is 4π R² σ T_eff^4. When the spots are visible, the flux is (4π R² - A) σ T_eff^4 + A σ T_spot^4.

So the difference (ΔL) is [ (4π R² - A) T_eff^4 + A T_spot^4 ] - [4π R² T_eff^4 ].

Which is (4π R² T_eff^4 - A T_eff^4 + A T_spot^4 ) - 4π R^2 T_eff^4.

Which simplifies to -A T_eff^4 + A T_spot^4.

Factor out A: A (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ).

So ΔL = A (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) * sigma.

But the star's original luminosity is L0 = 4π R² sigma T_eff^4.

So the fractional change is ΔL / L0 = [ A (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) ] / (4π R² T_eff^4 ) )

Substituting A = 0.4 π R²:

= [ 0.4 π R² (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) ] / [4 π R^2 T_eff^4 ]

The pi and R^2 cancel:

= [ 0.4 (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) ] / [4 T_eff^4 ]

= [ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) * 0.4 ] / [4 T_eff^4 ]

Simplify 0.4 /4 → 0.1.

So,

= 0.1 * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) / T_eff^4.

= 0.1 [ (T_spot / T_eff )^4 - 1 ]

Wait, that's a better way to write it. So,

ΔL/L0 = 0.1 [ (5000/6000)^4 - 1 ]

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

Compute 0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944. Then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

ΔL/L0 ≈ 0.1 * (0.4823 - 1) = 0.1 * (-0.5177) ≈ -0.05177.

So that's a dip of about 5.18%. So the fractional change is about -5.18%, so the amplitude is approximately 5.18%.

Now, for the exoplanet scenario, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

Wait, that's about 0.228, which is approximately 0.23. But looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39 squared is about 0.15, which is larger than 0.05.

B) ~0.07 → 0.07^2=0.0049, way smaller.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121.

D) ~0.32 → 0.32^2=0.1024.

Hmm, none match 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait! The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. But in reality, when the star rotates, only a portion of the spots is visible at any time. Wait, no — wait, the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully in view. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible, which is what I calculated. So the dip is 5.18%.

But according to the options, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the spot area.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. Because sometimes, the filling factor is defined as the fraction of the entire surface covered by spots. Oh wait, the question says:

"One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So my previous calculation is correct.

Hmm, but the options don't include 0.23. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to vary their visibility, but the amplitude observed is half that maximum dip. Because when the spots rotate into view, the dip starts at zero and reaches maximum when the spots are fully visible.

Wait no, the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. Or is it the maximum dip? Hmm, the problem says that the photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness. So the amplitude would be the maximum dip. So perhaps I'm correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: the flux from the star when spots are visible is (L0 - A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )).

Wait
