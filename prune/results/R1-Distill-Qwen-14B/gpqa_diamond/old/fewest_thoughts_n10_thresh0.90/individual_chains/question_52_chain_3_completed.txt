Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2), and how this ratio changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Wait, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when spots are not there. But the question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the factor would be (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

Wait, wait. I think I should write it the other way. The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So, if I have the ratio N1/N2, that would be the inverse: (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ).

But wait, the question is about the ratio of level 1 to level 2. So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Since E2 is higher than E1 (assuming level 2 is higher energy), E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponent is negative, making the ratio smaller. But in this case, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, I need to figure out how the effective temperature affects this ratio.

The transition wavelength is 1448 Å. Hmm, that's in the far ultraviolet, I think. But maybe that's a red herring for this particular calculation. Because the wavelength is given, perhaps we can find the energy difference using E = hc/λ.

Let me jot down the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. So, E = hc/(λ) * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) to get it in eV, maybe.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the energy difference ΔE in terms of k*T, or in terms of the temperature. Because the exponential term in the Boltzmann factor is (ΔE)/(k T). So, maybe I can compute that term for both the Teff when there are no spots (6000 K) and when there are spots (5500 K).

Wait, but wait. The star's overall Teff decreases when spots are present. So, the average Teff is lower. But wait, the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So, when the star has spots, part of the surface is at a lower temperature than the rest. However, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present? Or is it that the star's average Teff is 5500 K? Hmm, the question says the overall photospheric Teff decreases. So, maybe the photosphere's temperature is lower when spots are present. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, but the rest is at 6000 K. Wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps we're to model the star as having two regions: 40% of the surface at a lower temperature (the spots) and 60% at 6000 K. But the problem says that the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but perhaps for this problem, we can model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

Wait, but the problem says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is now 5500 K. But that might not be the case, because spots are cooler regions, so the overall flux would be a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas. Wait, but the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the Teff of the entire star is 5500 K. So, perhaps the star's total flux is such that its Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But I'm not sure if that's necessary for this problem. Wait, the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So, perhaps the photosphere's temperature is either 6000 K (no spots) or 5500 K (with spots). Alternatively, if the star's photosphere is divided into two regions, with 40% at a lower temperature and 60% at 6000 K, then the average would be 5500 K. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps each region's photosphere is at a different temperature, and the observed line corresponds to the average across the entire surface. But that complicates things, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that when the star has spots, the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K, so the entire photosphere's temperature is lower. That would make the problem simpler. So, the ratio of N1/N2 would be determined by the effective temperature of the entire photosphere.

So, let's proceed with that assumption. So, when there are no spots, T = 6000 K, and when there are spots, T = 5500 K.

The ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Since E2 > E1, E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponential term is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but ΔE is E2 - E1. So, the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

But since the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which implies that when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases. Let me check: if T decreases, then the exponential term becomes smaller. Because as T goes down, (ΔE)/(k T) increases since T is in the denominator. So, exp(-x) decreases as x increases. So, when T decreases, (ΔE/(k T)) increases, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So, N1/N2 would decrease when T decreases. That's what the problem states, so that makes sense.

So, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it does is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots = [exp(-ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T_sp)) ].

Wait, but wait. N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). The g factors (statistical weights) are constants for the energy levels, so when taking the ratio of N1/N2 in two scenarios (with and without spots), the (g1/g2) term cancels out.

So, factor = [exp(-ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T_sp)) ] 

Which simplifies to exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T_sp - 1/T_no) ) ].

So, factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) ) ]

Wait, because when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, and without spots, T is 6000 K.

Wait, no: no, wait. Wait, the ratio when no spots is (N1/N2)_no_spots = exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)).

The ratio when spots are present is (N1/N2)_spots = exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)).

So, the factor is [exp(-ΔE/(k*6000))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k*5500))] 

Which is exp[ (ΔE/(k) ) ( 1/5500 - 1/6000 ) ) ]

Because:

[ exp(a) ] / [ exp(b) ] = exp(a - b )

So, a is (-ΔE/(k*6000)), and b is (-ΔE/(k*5500)).

So, a - b = [ -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] - [ -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ]

So, factor = exp[ ΔE/(k) ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ) ]

Now, I need to compute this exponent. But to compute that, I need ΔE. Since the transition is at λ=1448 Å (angstroms), which is 1.448e-7 meters.

E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

Compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

E = 1.9878e-25 J·m / 1.448e-7 m ≈ 1.3717e-18 J per photon.

But I need this in terms of eV because eventually, we'll relate it to k*T.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So, E in eV is (1.3717e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.56 eV.

Hmm, that seems high. Wait, wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, compute E again.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 )

= (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7 )

= 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.3717e-18 J.

Yes, that's correct. Now, convert to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E = 1.3717e-18 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a large energy difference. Because, for example, visible light photons are about 1-3 eV. So, 1448 Å is in the near UV or even far UV. Hmm, maybe that's correct.

But wait, the question says that the transition corresponds to 1448 Å. So, ΔE is E2 - E1 = hc/λ, which is 8.56 eV.

Wait, but wait, another approach. Because sometimes, the energy difference is given by the photon's energy, but perhaps we can compute the ratio using the temperatures instead of calculating absolute energies.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute (E2-E1) in terms of the temperature.

But perhaps I should proceed with the calculation.

So, the exponent is:

(ΔE/(k)) * (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) )

But wait, wait, let me think. Let me compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) first.

Compute 1/5500 = approximately 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

Subtracting: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 K^-1 = 1.513e-5 K^-1.

So, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * 1.513e-5.

Now, ΔE is 8.56 eV. Let me express this in J per particle.

Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, ΔE = 8.56 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.371e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.381e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.381e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.93e4 K.

So, 9.93e4 K multiplied by 1.513e-5 K^-1:

9.93e4 * 1.513e-5 ≈ (9.93 * 1.513) * 1e-1.

9.93 * 1.513 ≈ approximately 15.03 (since 10*1.5=15, 9.93 is a bit less than 10, but 1.513 is a bit more than 1.5, so 15.03 is reasonable).

So, 15.03 * 0.1 = 1.503.

So the exponent is approximately 1.503.

So, the factor is exp(1.503) ≈ what? Let me compute that.

exp(1) is about 2.718, exp(1.5) is approximately 4.4817, and 1.503 is very close to 1.5. So, exp(1.503) ≈ ~4.49.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. Let me think, 1.503 is a little over 1.5.

Another way: using a calculator, but I'll proceed without. Alternatively, approximate using Taylor series.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about 4.5. So, the factor is about 4.5. So, the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times the ratio with spots. So, the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So, the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made an error in computing ΔE or the exponent.

Wait, let me recompute ΔE.

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 meters.

E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 ≈ 1.371e-18 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, converting to eV: 1.371e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.56 eV. Correct.

k is 1.381e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = (8.56 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.381e-23 J/K).

Let me compute that again: 8.56 * 1.602 = approx 13.71, so 13.71e-19 J / (1.381e-23 J/K) = (13.71e-19)/(1.381e-23) = (13.71 / 1.381) * 1e4 ≈ (9.93) * 1e4 ≈ 9.93e4 K.

So, that part is correct.

Now, (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000) )= 500/(33,000,000) )= 1/(66,000) )≈ 1.515e-5 K^-1.

So, 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.93 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

9.93 * 1.5 is 14.895. 1.515 is about 0.015 more than 1.5, so 9.93 * 0.015 = 0.14895. So, total is approximately 14.895 + 0.14895 ≈ 15.04395. Multiply by 0.1 → about 1.5044.

So, the exponent is approximately 1.504.

exp(1.504) is about e^1.504 ≈ e^(1.5) * e^(0.004) ≈ 4.4817 * (1 + 0.004) ≈ 4.4817 * 1.004 ≈ 4.499.

So, approximately 4.5. So the factor is 4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of LTE. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) is the inverse:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right).
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{no spots}}}\right)}{\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{spots}}}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Energy difference (\(\Delta E\))
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.3717 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.3717 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Boltzmann factor
The temperatures are \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The term \( \frac{1}{T} \) for each temperature is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.8182 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The difference is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = 1.8182 \times 10^{-4} - 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Exponent calculation
The ratio of the factor involves the term \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \), where \( k = 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Substituting \( \Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \) and converting to joules:

\[
\Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 1.371 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{1.381 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.93 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

The exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (9.93 \times 10^4)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.503.
\]

### Step 4: Final factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.503) \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio of \( N_1/N_2 \) when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
