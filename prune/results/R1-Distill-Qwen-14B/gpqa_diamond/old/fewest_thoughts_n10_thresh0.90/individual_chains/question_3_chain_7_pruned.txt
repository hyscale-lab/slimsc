Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about expectation values for a spin-half particle. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the probabilities of different states, right?

Alright, the particle is in a state described by 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. So that means they form a basis for the Hilbert space here.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh yeah, expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured this observable many times on the system.

I think the formula for expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute that.

Let me break it down. The operator is a sum of two terms: 10σz and 5σx. The expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term. So, E = ⟨10σz⟩ + ⟨5σx⟩. Which is the same as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So I can compute each expectation separately.

First, calculating ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that should make this easier. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right?

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me write ψ as a column vector to make things clear. |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. But I'll keep it symbolic for now.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is ψ† σz ψ. Since σz is diagonal, this is easy. Let me compute it. σz is [[1, 0],[0, -1]]. So when I multiply σz by ψ, I get [0.5 * 1, 0.866 * (-1)] which is [0.5, -0.866]. Then ψ† is [0.5, 0.866], so the dot product is 0.5*0.5 + (-0.866)*0.866.

Wait, or maybe I should just use the coefficients. Since σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. The expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

So the probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli x matrix. It's [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value can be found using the same method.

Hmm, but how do I compute ⟨σx⟩ for this state? Another way is to note that σx is the spin in the x-direction, so it's related to the expectation value based on the state's components.

Alternatively, since the state is a superposition, I can calculate it using the formula. So ψ is a column vector, [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ.

So σx acting on ψ gives [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Now, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. The dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, I can compute it as:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then the dot product with [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = (0.5 + 0.5) * sqrt(3)/2 = (1) * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So, ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding up the two contributions: -5 +4.33 = -0.666... Hmm, wait, but let me do it precisely without approximating so soon.

Wait, let's be exact. The exact value of ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 =4.33.

So the total expectation value is -5 +4.33 = -0.67 approximately.

Wait, but wait, I should carry more precise numbers. Let's compute the exact value.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact value first and then approximate.

So, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -
