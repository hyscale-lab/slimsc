Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's see what we've got.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero. So, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2.

So, 2*9 +2 =20. 20 -11 =9. Plus N is 1 (since each nitrogen counts as one), and O is 0 for this calculation. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting in, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds equivalent, so 3) and maybe a double bond or ring plus some other structures. Or maybe the benzene plus an amide or ester group which would have another double bond.

Looking at the IR data: medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So, an amide or an ester because both have carbonyl. But wait, in amides, the carbonyl is usually around 1650-1700 cm-1, but esters are higher, around 1730-1760. Hmm, so if it's 1720, maybe it's an ester or possibly an amide. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl? Wait, in some cases, amides can be lower. Let me think. Wait, the amide I band is around 1650, but maybe if it's an acylimine or something else, the peak could be higher. Hmm, but let's hold that thought.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several signals: 

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – that’s a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something else, like an oxygen in an ester.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet. 2H and broad suggests maybe an NH2 or something that's exchanging, but wait, the molecular formula has only one N. So in the options, some have amines, others amides. Let me see the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So the structure is O=C(NH2) attached to benzene with an OCH2CH3 at the 3 position.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide has a H attached to the carbonyl. So structure would be HCONH-phenyl with ethoxy at 4.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That's an amino group on the benzene, and a propionate ester. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So the ethyl group would be at the end. But wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 1.20 which is for CH2CH3. Propionate would have another CH2, but maybe not.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C(OEt) attached to the benzene with an NH2 group at position 4. So, benzene with NH2 at 4 and ester at another position, likely the 1 position.

So let's look at the NMR again. 

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H – ethyl group. So ethyl ester or ethyl something.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm. So 2H as singlet, but also broad. Could that be an NH group? But the molecular formula has one N, which is in the amine or amide.

Wait, the NMR shows 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Wait, ethyl ester would have a CH2CH3, which is split into triplet. So the ethyl group is perhaps part of an ester, like OCH2CH3.

Wait, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would be a quartet around 4.1
