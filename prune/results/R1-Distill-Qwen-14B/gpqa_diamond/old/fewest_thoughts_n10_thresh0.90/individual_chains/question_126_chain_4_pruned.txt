Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that an organic chemist did two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. Then they combined the products and ran them on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. The question is how many peaks they'll see in each.

Let me start by understanding each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone. Let me draw the structure.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is: CH2CH2... wait, let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one means a six-carbon chain with the ketone on carbon 3. So positions are:
1   2   3   4   5   6
CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO on the third carbon. So it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)2-CH3. But wait, the substituents: the 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5, right?

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But the 5-methoxy is on carbon 5. So let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: OCH3 attached? Wait, no. Wait, the 5 is in the middle.

Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the hexane chain is six carbons, with the ketone on C3. So positions 1,2,3
