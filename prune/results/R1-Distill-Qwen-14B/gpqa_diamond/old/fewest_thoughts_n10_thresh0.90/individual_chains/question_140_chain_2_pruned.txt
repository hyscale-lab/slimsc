Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is around 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and the problem is about finding the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Wait, let me list out the given information:

1. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.
2. X reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with equal protons and neutrons. So, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in W's molecule.
3. A precipitate G forms. Heating G releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K.
4. When a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. The product is probably an ester or something similar, but I'm not sure. Wait, wait, the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Hmm. Wait, maybe X is an alcohol? Or another functional group.

Also, the substance X and its analog are reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, common reagents are things like NaOH, KOH, perhaps Grignard reagents, but wait, Grignard reagents are like R Mg X. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, like Na or K. But I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Y is a liquid. Common liquids in such reactions are water, perhaps. If Y is water, then X reacting with it could produce various gases. Let's think about possible gases W where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in each molecule.

Let me think about gas W possibilities. The molecule must have equal protons and neutrons. So for each atom in the molecule, the number of protons and neutrons would have to be equal, but wait, that's for each atom. Or maybe the total protons and total neutrons in the entire molecule.

Wait, the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, if W is H2O, that's 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). Let's add them up: 2*(1+0) + (8+8) = 2 +16=18. Wait, no, wait, total protons would be 2*1 + 8 = 10. Total neutrons: 2*0 +8 (since oxygen has 8 neutrons in its isotope, but wait, oxygen's usual isotope is O-16 with 8 neutrons. So for H2O, the molecule would have 10 protons and 8 neutrons. Not equal. So H2O doesn't fit.

Wait, but maybe W is CO2? Let's see. CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (each 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons:6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons:6 (C) + 2*8=22. Oh! So the gas W is CO2. Because each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the condition.

So W is CO2. Which implies that X reacts with Y (maybe water) to produce CO2. So what could X be? If X is a metal carbonate, but wait, then Y would be an acid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Let me think again.

Wait, if X is a metal, reacting with an acid (Y) could produce CO2. But that would require X being a carbonate, but then Y would be an acid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is H2O and the reaction produces CO2. Let me think about that.

Wait, maybe X is a metal carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with an acid (Y), like H2SO4, to produce CO2 gas. But wait, Y is a liquid, so perhaps H2SO4 is Y. But then, what's the precipitate? Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of H+ ions, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if Y is H2O, and X is a carbonate, perhaps the reaction is decomposition. But decomposition of a carbonate upon heating, but the question says the reaction is violent. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. Let's think about what G could be. If X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction would be: Na2CO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H2O + CO2↑. Wait, but that's a gas, but in this case, the precipitate is G. So maybe Y is not an acid, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if X is a metal, and Y is a solution of a compound that forms an insoluble salt with X. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: What about B? When G is heated, it releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Let's compute that in Celsius: 277 K is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C, approximately 4°C. So B's melting point is around 4°C. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water (0°C), but that's too low. Another thought: maybe B is a metal with a low melting point. Wait, but 277 K is very close to room temperature. Wait, no, wait, room temperature is 25°C, so 277 K is 4°C. So maybe B is a metalloid or a metal that has a low melting point. For example, mercury has a melting point around -39°C, so that's too low. Maybe something like cadmium? No, cadmium's melting point is higher. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid at room temperature but melts around 4°C. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if B is a carbonate? No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, when G is heated, it decomposes. Suppose G is a carbonate, like calcium carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and CaO. But CaO has a melting point of around 2572°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is a metal oxide. Or perhaps B is a metal. Let me think. Alternatively, suppose G is a hydroxide. For example, if G is a basic carbonate, maybe heating it gives a metal oxide. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is a carbonate that doesn't decompose, but that seems unlikely. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the precipitate G. What if G is sodium bicarbonate? No, but sodium bicarbonate decomposes upon heating to produce CO2 and Na2CO3, but I'm not sure if that fits. Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think again about the gas W. The only gas I can think of that has equal total protons and neutrons is CO2, as each molecule has 22 of each. So W is CO2. So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. What reactions produce CO2 gas? Combustion is one, but that's probably not with a liquid. Decomposition of carbonates with acids is another. So, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate.

Wait, but the reaction should be violent. So maybe the acid is a strong one, like H2SO4. But if X is a carbonate, then X + H2SO4 → CO2 + S-related products. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid and can react with carbonates to produce CO2. So maybe Y is H2SO4, and X is a carbonate like Na2CO3.

But wait, if X is a carbonate, then when it reacts with H2SO4 (liquid Y), it would produce CO2 gas, sulfate ions, and water. The precipitate G would be the metal sulfate? Or perhaps a sulfate is soluble, so maybe the precipitate is something else. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal hydroxide, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe Y is a solution of HCl. So if X is a metal carbonate, the reaction would be X (carbonate) + HCl → CO2 + chloride salt + H2O. The precipitate G would be the chloride salt. But if X is a carbonate, then the chloride would be, say, NaCl (if X is Na2CO3). But NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe X is a different carbonate, like CaCO3. CaCO3 is not very soluble in HCl, but when reacted with it, would produce CaCl2, which is soluble. So again, no precipitate. Hmm, perhaps X isn't a carbonate.

Wait, maybe Y isn't an acid. Another possibility: Y could be a solution of a nitrate, and X is a metal that reacts to produce some gas. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a peroxide, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid. When it reacts with X, perhaps it forms an ester or an acid derivative. The product has two oxygen atoms, so maybe it's an acetal or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, think about what X could be if it's a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, NaH, Mg (for Grignard reagents), etc. Alternatively, maybe X is a strong base like NaOH. If X is NaOH, then Y could be an acid. Wait, but when NaOH reacts with an acid, it forms a salt and water, but would produce gas? Probably not, unless the acid is carbonated. Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like sodium. Sodium (Na) reacts violently with water (Y) to produce H2 gas (W). But W's molecule would have 2 H atoms, so 2 protons and 0 neutrons each. So total protons 2, neutrons 0. That's not equal. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if W is H2, then the condition isn't met. So that can't be. So perhaps X isn't a metal.

Alternatively, maybe X is a peroxide, like H2O2. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's go back to W. Since W is CO2, as I thought earlier, maybe the reaction is X + Y → CO2 + something. So what if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. The reaction would produce Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2. But wait, the precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble in water. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps X is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. Reacting it with H2SO4 would produce CO2, Na2SO4, and H2O. Again, the precipitate would be the sulfate, which is soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is a salt solution that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if X is Ba(OH)2 and Y is a solution of Na2SO4, then the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate and NaOH. But then, where does CO2 come from? BaSO4 is a precipitate, but the gas would have to be something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate and X is an acid. But that would produce CO2, but I'm not sure about the precipitate.

Wait, maybe the precipitate G is a carbonate. But heating the carbonate would produce CO2 and the corresponding oxide. For example, if G is CaCO3, heating it would produce CaO and CO2. But CaO has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the information we have. The gas W is CO2, so the reaction is producing CO2. So X and Y reacting must produce CO2. So X and Y could be a carbonate and an acid.

Wait, but when X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction produces CO2, and the salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate as G. So perhaps Y is a weak acid, and the salt is insoluble, leading to a precipitate.

Wait, for example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl. The reaction would produce CaCl2, H2O, and CO2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps X is a sulfide. If X is FeS and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce H2S gas, not CO2. So that's not it.

Another thought: perhaps X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble sulfate when reacted with an acid. For example, if X is Ag2CO3, which is not common, but perhaps reacts with HCl to produce AgCl precipitate. However, Ag2CO3 is not a common compound; silver carbonate is not very stable.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate of a group 1 metal. Group 1 carbonates (like Na2CO3) are more soluble, so when reacted with HCl, they produce soluble chlorides. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a compound that reacts with X to form a carbonate, which then decomposes. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with H2SO4 to produce CO2, Na2SO4, and H2O. But again, Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B, which has a melting point of about 4°C. What's a solid that melts around 4°C? One possibility is water ice, but that's 0°C. Another is maybe a metal with a low melting point. Wait, gallium has a melting
