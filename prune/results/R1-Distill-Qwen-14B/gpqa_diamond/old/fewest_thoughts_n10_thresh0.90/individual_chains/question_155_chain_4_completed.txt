Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem talks about an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these operators has a given matrix form in a certain basis. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which probably means that the matrices are diagonal in that basis for Pz. But wait, looking at the matrix for Pz, it's diagonal with elements hbar, 0, and -hbar on the diagonal. Oh right, because the basis is its eigenvectors, so Pz is diagonal.

The system is found in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -ℏ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, the vector is ( -1/2, √2/2, -1/2 ). Wait, no, wait: 1/sqrt(2) is the same as sqrt(2)/2, but let me check the exact numbers. So the vector is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So ΔPz = sqrt( <Pz²> - <Pz>² ).

But wait, since Pz is a Hermitian operator, the expectation values would just be real numbers. So first, I need to compute <Pz> and <Pz²>.

Wait, but since the state is given, maybe I can compute these directly. Let me think about the state. The state is a column vector, so it's a 3-component vector. Let me denote the state as |ψ> = [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

Since the matrix for Pz is diagonal, the expectation value <Pz> is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the probabilities (squares of the amplitudes in each eigenstate). Wait, no, because the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. So the expectation value <Pz> is the sum over the components: |a|^2 * (Pz eigenvalue for the first state) + |b|^2 * (eigenvalue for the second state) + |c|^2 * (eigenvalue for the third state).

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvalues of Pz are given by the diagonal elements. So the first basis vector (e.g., |+z> ) has eigenvalue ℏ, the second (middle one?) has 0, and the third ( |-z> ) has -ℏ.

Wait, looking at the matrix for Pz:

Pz = [ [ ℏ, 0, 0 ],
        [0, 0, 0 ],
        [0, 0, -ℏ ] ]

So the eigenvalues are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ, corresponding to the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively.

So the state |ψ> is written as a linear combination of these eigenstates. So |ψ> = a|+z> + b|middle> + c|−z>.

Wait, but what's the middle state's role? Since the second component is 0 for Pz, the eigenstate is any vector in that subspace, but in this case, the state is written as a vector with components (a, b, c). Hmm.

To compute <Pz>, it's just the sum of each component's amplitude squared multiplied by its corresponding eigenvalue. Because the state is already in the eigenbasis of Pz.

So, <Pz> = |a|^2 * (ℏ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ℏ).

Let's compute each term.

Compute |a|^2: a = -1/2, so |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Similarly, |b|^2: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

And |c|^2: ( -1/2 )^2 = 1/4.

So <Pz> = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ)
= (1/4 - 1/4)ℏ = 0 * ℏ = 0.

So <Pz> is zero. That's interesting.

Now, what about <Pz²>? Since Pz is diagonal, the square is the diagonal of squares. So the eigenvalues squared are (ℏ)^2, 0^2, and (-ℏ)^2. So the eigenvalues for Pz² are ℏ², 0, and ℏ².

So <Pz²> = |a|^2*(ℏ²) + |b|^2*(0) + |c|^2*(ℏ²)
= (1/4)ℏ² + 0 + (1/4)ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt( <Pz²> - <Pz>^2 ). Since <Pz> is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2)ℏ² ) = (ℏ / sqrt(2)).

Wait, let me compute that again. Because (1/2)ℏ² is the value under the square root. sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = ℏ * sqrt(1/2) ) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is ℏ/sqrt(2), which matches.

But wait, another way to compute is to calculate the variance, which for any observable is <(Pz - <Pz>)²> = <Pz²> - <Pz>². So since <Pz> is zero, it's just <Pz²>, which we found to be (1/2)ℏ². So the standard deviation is sqrt(1/2)ℏ, which is ℏ / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the first, second, and third basis vectors, respectively. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
