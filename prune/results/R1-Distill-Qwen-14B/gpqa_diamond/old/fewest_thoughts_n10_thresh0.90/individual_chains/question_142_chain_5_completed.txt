Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are four points in a 3D space, with coordinates like (1,1,0) or (0,0,1), etc.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (a statistical mixture of pure states). For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical combination of projectors.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So that looks familiar. Wait, I think this is the density matrix for a completely mixed state of a qubit. Because when you have a completely mixed state, it's an equal mixture of all possible states, but wait, no, wait. No, wait, in this case, it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So it's a completely mixed state for a qubit, right?

But wait, how does this relate to the Bloch sphere representation? Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix of a pure state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector pointing from the origin to a point on the Bloch sphere, and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So for a completely mixed state, the density matrix is (I)/2. Because if you have a state that's a maximally mixed state, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2. Because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal and each has a 50% probability.

Wait, but in this problem, ρ is exactly that: (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2. So that's a completely mixed state. So in Bloch sphere terms, this corresponds to the origin, because the vector r would be (0,0,0). Because the density matrix for a mixed state is (I + r·σ)/2, and when r is zero, it's just I/2, which is the maximally mixed state.

So the geometrical position in qubit space (which is the Bloch sphere) would be at the origin. Because the Bloch sphere's surface is the set of pure states, and the origin is the completely mixed state.

Wait, but I should double-check. The origin in the Bloch sphere is the point (0,0,0), which is the center. So the vector r is zero.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole (which would be |0⟩ if I remember correctly, or maybe |1⟩, depending on convention). Option A is (1,1,0), which is on the equator. Option D is (1,1,1), which is somewhere else in 3D space, but that's probably outside the Bloch sphere.

Wait, wait, the Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, so any point with a magnitude greater than 1 isn't possible. Option D is (1,1,1), which has a magnitude of sqrt(3), which is more than 1, so that's outside the sphere. So it can't be D.

So the correct answer must be option C, (0,0,0), because that's the origin, the completely mixed state.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state of a qubit, where the system is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the Bloch vector \(r\) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(r = (x, y, z)\) is a vector in three-dimensional space. For a maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector \(r\) is zero because there is no preference for any direction in the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the origin \((0,0,0)\) in the qubit space.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\(r = (1,1,0)\))**: This point lies on the equator of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **Option B (\(r = (0,0,1)\))**: This is the north pole of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **Option C (\(r = (0,0,0)\))**: This is the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.
- **Option D (\(r = (1,1,1)\))**: This point lies outside the Bloch sphere (radius 1) and is not physically meaningful for a qubit state.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
