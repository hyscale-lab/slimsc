Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian provided. The mass is 6 GeV, which is a pretty sizable mass, but not extremely large. So I need to figure out what particles X can decay into based on the conservation laws and the given interaction terms.

First, looking at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f_bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, wait, perhaps it's written with some typos. Let me think. The interaction term is probably something like L = λ f ψ_f^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the term might be written as L = -λ f ψ_f^dagger X ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps the exact form isn't crucial for this problem, but the important part is that the boson X couples to fermions.

Wait, no, the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f_bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps that's a typo and it's supposed to be ψ_f (y), not f_bar? Or maybe it's f times X times ψ_f. Alternatively, perhaps it's an interaction term where the boson X couples to a fermion current. Oh, wait, maybe it's like L = λ X ψ_f^† ψ_f, which would make it a Yukawa coupling. Because Yukawa interactions are between a scalar (or boson) and two fermions.

So, in that case, the boson X would couple to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the possible decay products of X would be into a fermion and its antiparticle. But the question is, which fermions are allowed?

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay to be possible, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of X. Otherwise, it's kinematically forbidden.

So first, I need to list all possible fermions that are light enough such that twice their mass is less than 6 GeV. Because each decay product is a pair of a fermion and antifermion, so the mass per particle is m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So what fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let me remember the approximate masses of particles. 

The up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV. The strange quark is about 100 MeV (or maybe a bit higher, but still way under 3 GeV). The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, the bottom is about 4.5 GeV. Wait, wait, so bottom quark's mass is about 4.1 to 4.7 GeV, depending on the source. So 4.5 is higher than 3 GeV. So a pair of b quarks would require 2 * 4.5 =9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks. Wait, but wait, the problem says the mass is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV is the maximum energy available. So any fermion pair where 2m < 6 GeV is allowed.

So let me list the possible quarks and leptons:

Quarks:

u: about 2-5 MeV
d: similar to u, maybe 3-7 MeV
s: about 95-100 MeV
c: about 1.2-1.5 GeV
b: 4.1-4.7 GeV (so 2m would be ~8.2-9.4 GeV, which is above 6 GeV)
t: way too heavy, ~173 GeV.

Leptons:

e: about 0.5 MeV
mu: ~105.7 MeV
tau: ~1.78 GeV
neutrinos: negligible, but they're massless in this context.

So for each fermion, calculate 2m.

u quark: 2m ~10 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.
d: same as u, allowed.
s: ~0.2 GeV, 2m = 0.2 GeV <<6 → allowed.
c: 1.5 GeV each → 3 GeV total. So 2m =3 GeV, which is exactly the limit. So 3 GeV is allowed? Or must it be less than? Well, in reality, when considering decay thresholds, the sum must be less than or equal because at threshold, the decay is possible. So 2m =3 GeV is allowed.

Charm quarks are allowed because 2m=3 GeV ≤6 GeV.

Bottom quarks are 4.5 GeV each → 9 GeV total. So not allowed.

Now, for leptons:

e: 2m ~1 MeV → allowed.
mu: 2m ~0.21 GeV → allowed.
tau: 2m ~3.56 GeV. Wait, 2 * 1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV. So 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are: u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. 

Wait, but wait, the tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is allowed because 3.56 <6. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Now, what about the other quarks and leptons? The bottom is too heavy. So possible decay channels are:

u u_bar,

d d_bar,

s s_bar,

c c_bar,

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-.

Wait, wait, but let me check the tau mass. If X is 6 GeV, then 2m_tau = ~3.56 GeV. Which is less than 6, so it's allowed.

So the allowed decay modes would include all these possibilities.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: X → b b_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, I thought b is too heavy. So option A includes b which is incorrect, so A is wrong.

Option B: X → c c_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That includes c, which is allowed because 2m_c=3 GeV, which is under 6.

Option C: includes t quarks, which are way too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but D includes b, which is wrong because 2m_b is 8-something GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So option D is incorrect.

So looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All of which are allowed. So the allowed decays are to these pairs.

So the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The boson \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must satisfy the condition that the total rest mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). This means \( 2m \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the fermion masses
The approximate masses of fermions are as follows:
- **Quarks**:
  - \( u \): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( d \): \( \sim 3-7 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( s \): \( \sim 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( c \): \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( b \): \( \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 2m > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
  - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- **Leptons**:
  - \( e \): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed)
  - Neutrinos: Negligible mass (effectively massless).

### Step 2: Identify allowed decay channels
From the above, the fermions that satisfy \( m \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \).

The corresponding decay channels are:
- \( X \rightarrow u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \).

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is far too heavy (\( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
