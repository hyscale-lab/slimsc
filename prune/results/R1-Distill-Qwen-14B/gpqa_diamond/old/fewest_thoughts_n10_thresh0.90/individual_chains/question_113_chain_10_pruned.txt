Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question provides data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. Hmm, I'll start by analyzing each piece of data and see what information I can extract.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate the presence of O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, usually around 2500-3300. Also, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol? Or perhaps something else with an O-H group.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The peak at 1650 might be due to conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substitution. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's in the options here.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including some that correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule probably has a double bond, maybe an alkene group. So, structures like esters with double bonds, or maybe a conjugated diene, but that's less likely.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry part. The fragment peak is at m/z 45. I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment, like the CH2CO+ ion, which is a fragment that can come from ketones or esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a tropylium ion or something else, but the most common is the CH2CO+ group. So that suggests the presence of a ketone or an ester, as these can lead to such fragments.

Putting this together: the compound has O-H groups (from the IR), a carbonyl group (from the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650), an alkene (from the NMR), and the mass spec suggests a ketone or ester.

Let me think about the possible functional groups. If there's an O-H, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a very strong O-H. Wait, another possibility is that the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something else, but that might complicate things.

The carbonyl at 1700 could be an ester (usually around 1730-1750 for esters), but maybe a conjugated ester could be lower. Alternatively, a ketone is around 1700. The peak at 1650 could be a conjugated ketone or possibly an aromatic ring. If it's an ester, the carbonyl would be higher, so the 1700 might fit a ketone. But wait, sometimes the carbonyl in an ester can be lower if there's conjugation.

Wait, wait. Another possibility is that the 1700 is an ester, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugation. Or maybe the 1650 is from an amide, but I don't see any amide in the options. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a conjugated ester or ketone.

So, considering the functional groups, the molecule might be an ester with an alcohol group, or a ketone with an alcohol group. Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and in a different region maybe. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure. For example, a cyclic ester is a lactone, which would have a carbonyl. Alternatively, if it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Looking at the molecular formulas provided: all options are C6H something O something. Let's list them:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, options A and D have O2 and O respectively. B and C have O and O2.

Let me think about degrees of unsaturation. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen, it's (2*6 +2 - H - O)/2.

Wait, but O doesn't directly affect the DoU formula. So, for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, if the molecule has a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR) and possibly a ring, that would require higher DoU. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for A: 2*6 +2 =14. 14 -12 (H) = 2. 2/2=1. So DoU is 1. So it could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, etc. But wait, if the molecule has a double bond (from vinyl H) and another, perhaps a carbonyl group. Because a carbonyl is a double bond. So that would require DoU of 2.

Ah, so let me compute DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU = (14 -12)/2 =1. So one DoU. But if it's a molecule with a double bond (one DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), that would require DoU=2. So that's a conflict. So option A can't have both a double bond and a carbonyl group. Therefore, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, but that depends.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-calculate.

The correct formula for DoU is: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So without X and N, it's (2C + 2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2. So 2*6=12 +2=14. 14-12=2. 2/2=1 DoU.

So one ring or double bond.

But if the molecule has a double bond (from vinyl) and a carbonyl (another double bond), that's two DoU. So this can't be. So option A can't have both a double bond and a carbonyl.

So perhaps the molecule is something else. Maybe it's a ring with a carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are on a double bond. So, that's a real double bond, so that's a DoU. Plus, the carbonyl is another DoU. So total DoU should be 2.

So let's calculate DoU for each option:

Option B: C6H10O. H=10, so (14-10)/2=2. DoU=2. So two double bonds or a double bond and a ring.

Option C: C6H10O2. (14-10)/2=2. DoU=2.

Option D: C6H12O. (14-12)/2=1. DoU=1.

So for DoU, options B and C have 2, which would fit having a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group (which is another double bond). So that's possible.

Option A and D only have one DoU, which might not fit since we have two double bonds (vinyl and carbonyl). So options A and D can be eliminated based on DoU.

So now, the possible options are B) C6H10O and C) C6H10O2.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 indicating O-H, and there's a
