Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. So, here's the setup: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And they give four options, with c=1, so the speed of light in a vacuum is 1.

Hmm, right. I remember that the speed of light in a medium like glass is given by v = c / n, where c is the speed in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? Because the glass is moving, maybe I need to consider some kind of relativistic effect here. Oh, but how?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass from the lab's perspective. So, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So, the light inside the glass is moving through a medium that's itself moving.

I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is something like u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity in one frame and u' is in another.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light inside the glass has a velocity, say u, relative to the glass. So, from the lab's frame, the velocity of the light would be u plus some correction due to the glass's motion. But I have to be careful about the direction.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So, let's say the glass is moving in the positive x-direction towards the observer. The light inside is moving in the same positive x-direction. So, from the lab's frame, the light's velocity would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity relative to the glass, but considering relativity.

So, in the glass's rest frame (let's call this frame S'), the light's velocity is v_light' = c/n (since n is the refractive index). Because in glass, the speed is lower than c. And since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame (let's say S), we need to find v_light in S.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light' = c/n in the positive x-direction.

Now, we need to find the velocity of the light in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass. Wait, no, wait: the lab is the rest frame, and the glass is moving at v. So, the glass's frame (S') is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame (S). So, to get the velocity of the light as seen in
