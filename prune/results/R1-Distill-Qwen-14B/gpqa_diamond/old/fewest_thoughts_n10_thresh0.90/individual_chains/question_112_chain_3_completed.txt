Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

Alright, the state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, I think the first thing I should do is normalize this state because probabilities depend on that.

So the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively.

First, let me write the state as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). To find the normalization factor, I need to compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> which is |a|^2 + |b|^2. 

Calculating |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i)/1 = (1 +1)=2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Then |b|^2: (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 +2i -2i + (i^2)(-1) → 4 +0 +1 =5. Wait, wait, no: (2−i)(2+i) = 2² + (i)(2) − (i)(2) − i². Let me compute it correctly: (2−i)(2+i) = 2*2 + 2i - 2i -i² = 4 - (-1) because i² is -1. So that's 4+1=5. Okay, so |a|²=2, |b|²=5. So the squared norm is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is ( (1+i)/√7 ) |up> + ( (2−i)/√7 ) |down>.

Next part of the question: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A, whose matrix representation has A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. Wait, so what's the operator A? Let's think.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems (since |up> and |down> are spin eigenstates). The matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and off-diagonal are ħ/2. So the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates we're interested in. So we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[0, a],[a,0]] are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0. The determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (a)^2 = λ² − a² = 0. So λ = ±a. In this case, a is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2). Therefore, the eigenstates are the states corresponding to λ = ħ/2 and λ = −ħ/2.

But wait, I should find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Let's do that.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.

So matrix becomes:

[ [ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ],
  [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ]

So, the equations are:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1) or (1,1)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

Matrix is:

[ [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ],
  [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ] ]

Equations:

( ħ/2 ) v1 + ( ħ/2 ) v2 = 0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So eigenvector is proportional to (1, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the state is |alpha>, and also find the average value of operator A.

So first, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Given |alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 ] |up> + [ (2−i)/√7 ] |down>.

Express this in terms of |+> and |->.

We have |up> = (|+> + |->)/√2,

and |down> = (|+> - |->)/√2.

Substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 ] * (|+> + |->)/√2 + [ (2−i)/√7 ] * (|+> − |->)/√2.

Let me factor out 1/(√7 * √2):

= 1/(√14) [ (1+i)(|+> + |->) + (2−i)(|+> − |->) ]

Let me expand this:

= 1/√14 [ (1+i)|+> + (1+i)|-> + (2−i)|+> − (2−i)|-> ]

Combine like terms for |+> and |->:

|+> terms: (1+i) + (2−i) = 3.

|-> terms: (1+i) − (2−i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = [3 |+> + (-1 + 2i) |-> ] / √14.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. For |->:

(1+i)|-> and − (2−i)|-> → [ (1+i) − (2−i) ] |->.

So (1+i - 2 + i) → ( (1-2) + (i +i) ) → (-1 + 2i). Yes.

So:

|alpha> = [3 |+> + (-1 + 2i) |-> ] / sqrt(14).

Wait, but let me compute the normalization. The coefficients for |+> and |-> are 3 and (-1+2i), respectively. So the squared magnitudes should add up to 1 because |alpha> is already normalized.

Compute |3|^2 + |(-1+2i)|²: 9 + [1 +4] = 9 +5=14. Then sqrt(14) in the denominator. So yes, correct.

So the coefficients of |+> and |-> are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14), respectively.

Wait, no, because |alpha> is expressed as [3 |+> + (-1 +2i)|-> ] / sqrt(14).

So the amplitude for |+> is 3/sqrt(14), and for |-> is (-1+2i)/sqrt(14).

But wait, the probability of measuring |+> would be the square of the magnitude of the coefficient. So |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429. And for |->, | (-1+2i)/sqrt(14) |^2 = [1^2 +2^2 ] /14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, and 5/14 is about 0.35714. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. But looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities, and option D has 0.61 and 0.29. Hmm, but wait maybe I made a mistake in the calculation because the question says the state is proportional, which I normalized.

Wait, let me go back. The state |alpha> was given as proportional to that combination, so I normalized it correctly. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64286 and 0.35714. So 0.64 and 0.36 are the probabilities. So that's option A's first part.

But wait, let me check: in the options, option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. So that's in line with this. But let's see the other parts.

The average value of operator A is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator (because it's given as an observable), its average is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Wait, because A is diagonal in its eigenbasis. So the expectation value is the sum over (eigenvalue * probability of that eigenstate). So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [9 -5]/(14) * (ħ/2) = (4/14)(ħ/2) = (2/7)(ħ/2) )= ħ/7.

Wait, that's correct. So the average value is ħ/7.

So looking at the options, option A says average is ħ/7. So for the probabilities, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches our 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.3571). So the average is ħ/7, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D has average 2ħ/sqrt(7), which is larger. Option B has 3ħ/sqrt(7), which is even bigger. Option C has hbar/sqrt(7), which is approximately 0.377 hbar, while option A's average is about 0.1428 hbar, which is lower.

Wait, but wait. Another way to compute the average is to compute <A> directly from the state. Let me try that.

The operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 for i≠j, else zero. So in the z-basis, A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/√7, (2-i)/√7 ]^T.

So to compute <A>, we can compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

So let's write |alpha> as a column vector:

[ (1+i)/√7 ]
[ (2-i)/√7 ]

Then A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So A |alpha> is:

Top component: 0*(1+i)/√7 + (ħ/2)*(2-i)/√7 = (ħ/2)(2−i)/√7.

Bottom component: (ħ/2)(1+i)/√7 + 0*(2−i)/√7 = (ħ/2)(1+i)/√7.

So <A> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A |alpha>.

Which is [ (1−i)/√7, (2+i)/√7 ] * [ (ħ/2)(2−i)/√7 , (ħ/2)(1+i)/√7 ].

So the dot product is:

(1−i)/√7 * (ħ/2)(2−i)/√7 + (2+i)/√7 * (ħ/2)(1+i)/√7.

Factor out ħ/(2 * 7):

= ħ/(14) [ (1−i)(2−i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]

Compute each term.

First term: (1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) −i*2 + i^2.

= 2 -i -2i + (-1) → 2-3i -1 = (1 - 3i).

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2.

= 2 +3i + (−1) → 1 +3i.

So sum: (1−3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So <A> = ħ/(14) * 2 = ħ/7.

Which matches what I had before. So the average is ħ/7.

So probability of |+> is 9/14 ≈ 0.6428, |-> is 5/14 ≈ 0.3571. So the options with these would be option A: 0.64 and 0.36. The average is ħ/7, so option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A has average hbar/7, which matches. So the correct answer would be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by calculating the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{so the total norm is } \sqrt{2+5} = \sqrt{7}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \). Using the relations:

\[
|\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle + |-\rangle), \quad |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle - |-\rangle),
\]

we substitute into \( |\alpha\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle + |-\rangle) + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle - |-\rangle).
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}|+\rangle + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}|-\rangle.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
P(|+\rangle) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(|-\rangle) = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( A \), we calculate:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(P(|+\rangle) - P(|-\rangle)\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(\frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \), match **Option A**.
