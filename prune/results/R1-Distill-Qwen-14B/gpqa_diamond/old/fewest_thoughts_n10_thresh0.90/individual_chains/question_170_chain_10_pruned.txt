Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, the state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, that's a vector, I think. So it's a two-component spinor, probably in the order of up and down states.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector again. So, the formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† * σ_y * ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix.

Let me write down the given state. The state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So, ψ is a column vector with first element 3i and second element 4. The Pauli y-matrix σ_y is given as:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So, to compute ψ† σ_y ψ, first I need to find the conjugate transpose of ψ. The conjugate transpose (or adjoint) of ψ is a row vector where each element is the complex conjugate. So, the first element is 3i becomes -3i, and the second is 4 remains 4. So ψ† is [-3i, 4].

Now, let's compute ψ† multiplied by σ_y. So ψ† is a 1x2 matrix, σ_y is 2x2, the multiplication should give a 1x2 matrix.

Calculating each element:

First element: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i
Second element: (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) = (3i^2) + 0. Wait, i^2 is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So it's -3.

Wait wait, wait. Let me double-check that. σ_y's first row is 0, -i. Wait no, the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

Multiplying ψ† * σ_y:

First component: (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 +4i =4i
Second component: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = 3i^2 +0= 3*(-1) =-3.

So the result after ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, we need to multiply this with ψ, which is [3i, 4]^T. So, each element is multiplied with the corresponding element in ψ? Wait, no, wait. When you multiply a row vector with a column vector, it's the dot product. So the result is (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (4i)(3i) =12 i^2 =12 (-1)= -12.

Second term: (-3)(4) = -12.

So total is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but the expectation value is for S_y, which is (ℏ/2) multiplied by σ_y, right? Because the spin operator S is (ℏ/2) σ. So the actual operator is S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y.

So the expectation value isn't just -24, but -24 multiplied by ℏ/2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The spin operator S_y is (ℏ/2) times σ_y. So when I compute ⟨S_y⟩, it's the expectation value of (ℏ/2) σ_y. So the value would be (ℏ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of σ_y.

So the calculation I did was for ⟨σ_y⟩, which is -24? Wait no, wait. Let me correct.

Wait, the way I computed ⟨σ_y⟩ is (ψ† σ_y ψ), which came out to -24. But wait, wait, my calculation. Let me recheck the multiplication steps.

Wait, when I multiplied ψ† (which is [-3i,4]) by σ_y, the result was [4i, -3], as I thought. Then, multiplying this row vector by ψ, which is [3i,4], gives:

(4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4) = 12 i² + (-12) = 12*(-1) -12 = -12-12= -24.

So that's correct. So ⟨σ_y⟩ is -24. But wait, no, wait a second. Because the state vector ψ must be normalized. Because the inner product of ψ†ψ should be 1 for a normalized state, but in this case, the state is (3i,4), so ψ†ψ is (3i)(-3i) + 4*4 = (9 i^2) +16 = 9*(-1)+16= -9+16=7. Oh right, that's 7, not 1. So the state is not normalized. So I need to account for that.

Because the expectation value formula actually requires the state to be normalized. So the expectation value is (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) ). Oh, right, because the actual formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) multiplied by ℏ/2.

Wait, let me clarify. The expectation value of S_y is (ℏ/2) multiplied by (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ). Because the operator is S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y.

So let's compute ψ† ψ. ψ is [3i,4], so ψ† is [-3i,4]. So ψ† ψ is (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = (-9 i²) +16 = (-9*(-1)) +16 =9 +16=25.

So ψ† σ_y ψ is -24, as we found earlier. So the expectation value of σ_y is (-24) /25. Then, the expectation value of S_y is (ℏ/2) * (-24/25 )= (-24 ℏ)/(50) = (-12 ℏ)/25.

Wait, because 25 is 25. So -24/25 multiplied by ℏ/2 is (-24 * ℏ) / (50) = (-12 ℏ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25, which matches.

Wait, but let me just recheck the steps in case I made a mistake.

Another way to look at it: The expectation value is (ℏ/2) times the expectation of σ_y. So compute the expectation of σ_y first.

The state is ψ = [3i,4]. The normalization factor is sqrt(25) =5, so the normalized state is [3i/5,4/5].

Then, the expectation value of σ_y is ψ† σ_y ψ divided by ψ† ψ. But since the state is already [3i,4], the calculation is as before.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Compute σ_y acting on ψ:

σ_y * ψ = [0*3i + (-i)*4, i*3i +0*4]^T = [ -4i, 3i² ]^T. i squared is -1, so that becomes [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Then, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So, ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, no, because σ_y ψ gives a vector, and ψ† is a row vector, so the product is ( -3i * (-4i) ) + (4 * (-3)).

Wait,
