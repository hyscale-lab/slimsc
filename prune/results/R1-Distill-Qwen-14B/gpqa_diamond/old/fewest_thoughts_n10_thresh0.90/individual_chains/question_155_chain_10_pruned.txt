Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, for a given quantum state. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula: ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩ for the given state.

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So I can’t directly say that ⟨P_z⟩ is zero or something; I have to compute the expectation values explicitly.

Let me jot down the given matrices for the operators. 

P_x matrix:
Row 1: (0, ħ/√2, 0)
Row 2: (ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2)
Row 3: (0, ħ/√2, 0)

P_y matrix:
Row 1: (0, -iħ/√2, 0)
Row 2: (iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2)
Row 3: (0, iħ/√2, 0)

P_z matrix:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0,0, -ħ)

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because for diagonal matrices, the basis is the eigenbasis.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me note this as a column vector. 

So first step: compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z in the state ψ. To do this, I multiply ψ^dagger (conjugate transpose) by P_z matrix multiplied by ψ.

Wait, but ψ has real components here, so the conjugate doesn't change anything. So ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ^T * P_z * ψ.

Let me compute that. 

P_z is diagonal, so when I apply it to ψ, it just scales each component. 

So P_z * ψ will be:
- First element: ħ*(-1/2)
- Second element: 0*(1/√2) = 0
- Third element: (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z ψ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, ψ^T * (P_z ψ) is the dot product of ψ and P_z ψ.

So: (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(ħ/2)

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4

Adding them: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. That's interesting.

Now I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is just P_z squared because it's diagonal. So the matrix P_z² would have elements (ħ)^2, 0, and (ħ)^2 for the third component. Wait, no:

Wait, P_z is diagonal with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ). So P_z squared would be (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which is ħ², 0, ħ². So P_z² is [[ ħ², 0, 0 ], [0, 0, 0], [0,0, ħ² ]].

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ^T * P_z² * ψ.

Again, since P_z² is diagonal, applying it to ψ just scales the first and third components, leaving the second as zero.

So P_z² ψ is [ (ħ²)*(-1/2), 0, (ħ²)*(-1/2) ]^T?

Wait no, wait. Let me compute each component:

First component: (ħ²) * (-1/2)
Second component: 0
Third component: (ħ²) * (-1/2)

Wait, no. Wait, P_z² is [[ ħ², 0, 0 ], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, ħ² ]]. So when you multiply P_z² by ψ, each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

Wait, ψ is [
