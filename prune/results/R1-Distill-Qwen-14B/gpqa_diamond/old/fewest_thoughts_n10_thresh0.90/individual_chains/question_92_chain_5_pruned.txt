Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Okay, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. I should probably draw this structure to visualize it better. So, looking at the formula, it's a hydrocarbon with double bonds. I count two double bonds in there: one on each end, maybe? Like, maybe it's something like 1,7-diene or something. Wait, actually, I think the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So each end has a substituent. Hmm, but maybe the exact structure isn't crucial for the calculation. Because the question is about enthalpy of formation, and they've given bond energies.

Wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. So, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies, but I think it's more about the bonds broken and formed in the molecule compared to the elements in their standard states.

Wait, wait. The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for hydrocarbons, that's from carbon ( graphite?) and hydrogen gas.

So, the general approach is: calculate the total bond energies of all bonds in the compound, subtract the bond energies of the elements in their standard states. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Like, the enthalpy of formation is equal to the sum of bond energies of the bonds formed minus the sum of bond energies of the bonds broken, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the correct formula is: Enthalpy of formation (Î”Hf) = sum of bond energies of all bonds in the compound (but considering whether they're being broken or formed... Hmm, no, maybe I should think in terms of the bonds in the molecule. Wait, another approach: the bond energies of the molecule. Since the molecule is formed from its constituent atoms, and the standard state is the elements. So for
