Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the products. Then, I have to pick the correct options from A to D.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, in this case, is the enolate of the malonate ester. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a sultone, or more accurately, it's a diester which can form an enolate upon deprotonation.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the substituent is on the beta carbon, I think. The structure would be CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-O-Me. Hmm, wait, no. Let me draw it properly. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3-position is where the p-tolyl group is attached. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, so the substituent is on the alpha position. No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 (if we number from the ester). So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituent is on the third carbon? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO^-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, but that would be the same as the carbonyl carbon. That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO^-. The 3-position would be the first carbon of the acrylate; wait, maybe the substituent is on the alpha carbon. Maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So when the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl group on C2. That makes sense. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3.

So, when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks this alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, the enolate will attack the beta carbon (the one with the p-tolyl group). So the malonate enolate has a negative charge on the central carbon, which attacks the double bond.

So the product should form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Let me think about the structure of dimethyl malonate. It's (CH3COO)2CHâ€“, so the enolate would be [CH2COO^- Na+], or similar. So the enolate would attack the acrylate's beta carbon, which is the C adjacent to the carbonyl.

So the product would have the structure where the malonate's carbanion adds to the beta position of the acrylate, leading to a conjugate addition.

Wait, but dimethyl malonate is a
