Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question gives me a Lagrangian term that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out the kinematically allowed decay channels at the lowest order.

Hmm, right. So the Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my notation. I think f here represents a fermion field, and ψ̄ is the Dirac adjoint. So this term is coupling the boson X to fermions, right?

I remember that for a boson like this, the decay depends on which fermions it can couple to, and their masses. Because according to the decay rules, the boson can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair if the fermion mass is less than or equal to half the boson mass. Because conservation of energy and all that.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that sums up to less than or equal to 6 GeV will be allowed.

Wait, but actually, each fermion has a mass. For a pair, each has mass m, so the total would be 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV. Wait, wait, no. Because if the boson is at rest, the fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to the boson's mass. Because in the center-of-momentum frame, the fermions must have enough energy to be created. So yes, the maximum mass per fermion would be 3 GeV, but wait, no, that's not correct. Because the sum of the masses of the pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So each fermion's mass must be ≤ (mass of X)/2 = 3 GeV. Wait, no. Wait, the boson is at rest, so the total energy of the fermion pair must be equal to the boson's mass. But the rest mass of each fermion is m, so for a pair, the minimum energy needed is 2m (if they are at rest relative to each other). So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Wait, wait, but looking at the fermion masses, which ones are below 3 GeV? Let's list the known fermion masses.

Leptons: electrons are about 0.5 MeV, negligible. Muons about 105 MeV. Tau is about 1.78 GeV. So tau is under 3 GeV.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Wait, top quark is way heavy, around 173 GeV, so way above 3 GeV. So the others: up and down are light, about a few MeV. Strange is about 100 MeV, charm is about 1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.5 GeV.

Wait, wait, bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So if the fermion is a bottom quark, each would have mass 4.5 GeV. So 2 *4.5 is 9 GeV, which is way above X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar, because 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV.

Wait, that's a problem. So looking back, the allowed fermions are those with m ≤ 3 GeV. Let me check each quark:

Up quark: about 2.2 MeV → way below 3 GeV. Similarly, down quark is about 4.7 MeV. Strange is about 100 MeV. Charm is around 1.5 GeV (I think, maybe 1.2-1.5 GeV). So 1.5 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So c quark is allowed. But bottom is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV.

Wait, wait, but wait! The Lagrangian term given is coupling X to fermion f. The term is L = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, perhaps I need to parse this correctly. Let me re-express that.

Wait, the term is written as -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps it's a typo, or perhaps the notation is a bit confusing. Oh wait, perhaps it's -λ f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f. So, for each fermion species ψ_f, the boson X can decay into ψ_f and anti-ψ_f.

So the question is, which fermion species can X decay into, given X's mass is 6 GeV.

So the fermion species are the ones that have m ≤ 3 GeV, since 2m ≤ 6.

So, which quarks and leptons have m ≤ 3 GeV?

Leptons:

Electron: 0.5 MeV → allowed.

Muon: ~105 MeV → allowed.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV → allowed.

So X can decay into e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Quarks:

Up: ~2.2 MeV → allowed.

Down: ~4.7 MeV → allowed.

Strange: ~100 MeV → allowed.

Charm: ~1.5 GeV → allowed.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 GeV → not allowed.

Top: way too heavy.

So X can decay into any of u, d, s, c, and the charged leptons e, mu, tau.

Wait, but wait. What about the tau? Its mass is 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV? Wait, wait no. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for the tau pair, each tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, they can be produced.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Same for the charm quark: each is about 1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV total. So 3 GeV ≤6 GeV, so that's allowed.

But for the bottom quark, 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV, so not allowed.

So the possible decays are into any fermion pair where the sum 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the possible fermions are: e, mu, tau (leptons), and u, d, s, c (quarks). So the decay products are pairs like uū, ddbar, s sbar, c cbar, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see the options.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

But wait, b is 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So option A includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Wait, but the c quark is allowed. So in option B, the decays include c cbar, which is allowed because 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6. So option B seems to include all allowed fermion pairs except for b and t.

Wait, but let me look at each option.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, t tbar, tau+, mu+, e+ e-

Wait, t is top quark, which is 173 GeV. 2m_t is way more than 6 GeV. So option C includes t tbar, which is not allowed, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ bbar b, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, mu+, e+ e-

But again, b is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but what about option B? Let's see.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Yes, that includes all the allowed fermions. So option B is A) X → b, s, u, d, tau, e, etc. But wait, option B includes c cbar, which is allowed. But option D doesn't include c cbar.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option A: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, e.

So includes b, which is over 3 GeV, so that's wrong.

Option B: X→ c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So includes c, which is 1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV total. So allowed. So all the fermions in option B have m ≤3 GeV.

Option C includes t, which is way over.

Option D includes b and not c. Wait, no, let me look again.

The options as given:

A) X→ b, s, u, d, tau, e.

B) X→ c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

C) X→ c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e.

D) X→ b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, so option D includes b, which is 4.5 GeV. So any decay into b bbar would require 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So option D's decay to b is not allowed.

So the correct option would be which includes all the fermions with m <= 1.5 GeV (for quarks) or m<= 3 GeV (for pairs). Wait, no. Wait, for a pair, each fermion must be <= 3 GeV. So 2m <=6 GeV.

So any fermion with m <= 3 GeV can be produced in a pair.

Which fermions are these?

Leptons: e (0.5 MeV), mu (105 MeV), tau (1.78 GeV) → all allowed.

Quarks: u (2.2 MeV), d (4.7 MeV), s (100 MeV), c (1.5 GeV), but b is 4.5 GeV (disallowed), t way higher.

So X can decay into any of these fermions and their antiparticles: u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but the interaction term is given as involving (v + X(y)). So I think that this is a Yukawa coupling. So the fermions that can couple to X are those in the term, so perhaps the fermions in the Lagrangian are only certain ones.

Wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by that term, so perhaps X couples to all the fermions present in that term. So perhaps the term is written as -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's a general term, meaning X can interact with any fermion ψ_f. So all fermions are allowed, provided their masses are compatible.

So in that case, the decay channels are all the fermion pairs where the mass is below 3 GeV.

Wait, but let me think about what fermions are allowed. So from the possible particles, X can decay into any pair of leptons or quarks where each has m <=3 GeV.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-

mu+ mu-

tau+ tau-

u u_bar

d d_bar

s s_bar

c c_bar

But wait, c is 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c=3 GeV, which is allowed.

So X can decay into any of these.

Now looking back at the options, which option includes all these possibilities?

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So it's X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's all the allowed fermion pairs.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but wait, wait. Looking back, the question says "kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order."

At lowest order, the decay would proceed via tree-level processes. So the decay X → f fbar occurs via the interaction term given. So each possible fermion pair that can be formed will have a decay channel.

So the allowed decays are all the fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So that's e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Thus, the correct option is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The decays are determined by the fermion masses, as the boson can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair only if the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to the boson's mass. For a boson of mass \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition is \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or equivalently \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays
The masses of known fermions are:
- **Leptons**: \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_\mu \approx 105 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Quarks**: \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- **Leptons**: \( e, \mu, \tau \)
- **Quarks**: \( u, d, s, c \)

The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are excluded because their masses are \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), both exceeding \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 2: Analyzing the Options
The allowed decays of \( X \) are into fermion-antifermion pairs: \( X \to f \bar{f} \), where \( f \) can be \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Now, we evaluate the given options:

- **Option A**: \( X \to b \bar{b}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

- **Option B**: \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes all allowed fermions (\( c, s, u, d, \tau, \mu, e \)) and excludes \( b \) and \( t \). **Correct**.

- **Option C**: \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, t \bar{t}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

- **Option D**: \( X \to b \bar{b}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) into fermion-antifermion pairs where \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Answer: B
