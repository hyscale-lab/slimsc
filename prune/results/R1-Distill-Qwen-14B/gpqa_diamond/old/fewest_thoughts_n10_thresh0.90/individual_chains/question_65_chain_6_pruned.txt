Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two parts, A and B, each involving a reaction. I need to determine the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A:
The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reaction conditions are THF, KH, and H+. THF is a solvent, and I remember that KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ might be something like a proton source, perhaps during workup.

Wait, wait. Oh, right! I think this setup is for a conjugate addition or maybe an elimination. Alternatively, I've heard of the Cope elimination, but that typically involves amines. Alternatively, maybe a cyclopropane formation via a Simmons-Smith reaction, but that uses Zn, Cu, and a diiodomethane. Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, usually a carbon. So 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol would have two rings connected at the 1 position, with a vinyl group (double bond) attached there. Let me try to imagine the structure. The spiro part is non, meaning 9 carbons. The two rings are a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring? Wait, no, spiro[3.5] means one ring is 3 carbons (so a cyclopropane?), and the other is 5 carbons (cyclopentane?), connected at the 1 position. So the 1-position is where both rings meet. And there's a double bond at the 5 position of the non chain? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the spiro has a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring, connected at the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the formula is more like two rings connected by a single carbon, which also has a vinyl group. So, the structure is a spiro compound with a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to that central carbon. And the alcohol is also on that same carbon, which is position 1. So, the molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol.

Now, the reaction conditions: THF is the solvent, and KH is a strong base. Then H+ presumably in workup. So, what does a strong base like KH do here? Maybe deprotonate an acidic hydrogen. The molecule has an alcohol group, which is a proton that could be abstracted, but it's not very acidic. Wait, but if the base is strong enough, like KH, which is a strong base, maybe it abstracts a proton leading to some kind of elimination or ring-opening.

Alternatively, I remember that when a base is used with an allylic alcohol, it can lead to elimination, forming a double bond. Wait, but that's more like the Cope elimination, which requires a 1,5-diene and a base to form a conjugated diene. Wait, but in this case, the structure might allow for some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an elimination, leading to the formation of a more stable structure, maybe a bicyclic compound. I've heard of pinacol rearrangements, but that's for 1,2-diols. Not sure that's applicable here.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group. When treated with a strong base like KH, maybe the base abstracts the hydroxyl proton, making an alkoxide. Then, perhaps the allylic hydrogen adjacent to the oxygen is abstracted, leading to an elimination. But wait, the base is strong, so maybe it's more about deprotonating a less acidic proton elsewhere.

Wait, alternatively, the reaction could be an acid-catalyzed process. But wait, the conditions here are in a basic medium? No, the solvent is THF, and the base is KH. Then adding H+ in the workup.

Wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition. Or perhaps the base induces a ring-forming elimination. For example, if the spiro structure loses a molecule of water, forming a double bond between two rings, leading to a bicyclic compound.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the central carbon (position 1) is connected to both rings. The spiro rings are 3-membered and 5-membered. The 5-en refers to a double bond in the 5 position of the non chain—perhaps that's in the 5-membered ring.

When the base deprotonates the alcohol, making an alkoxide, maybe an elimination occurs. If the alkoxide can lose a proton from a neighboring carbon, perhaps leading to formation of a double bond. Alternatively, the elimination could lead to the formation of a larger ring.

Wait, considering the structure, if the base induces the loss of the hydroxyl group, maybe via an E2 mechanism, abstracting a proton that's anti to the leaving group (but in this case, the leaving group could be the hydroxide after deprotonation). Wait, no, more likely, the base deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which then leaves as a good leaving group? Hmm, but in this case, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the base could abstract a proton from a position that's beta to the oxygen, leading to an elimination and forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion. Alternatively, the vinyl group could participate in some cycloaddition. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of the formation of a bicyclic ketone. Wait, the reaction conditions include H+ as part of the workup, perhaps leading to protonation. So maybe the base induces an elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, but the starting material isn't a ketone—it's an alcohol and has a double bond.

Wait, another approach: The reaction is using a strong base (KH) which is a deprotonating agent. So perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination leading to cyclization. Maybe it's aCope elimination, but for that, you need a 1,5-diene. Let me see—if the structure has a diene, then the base could abstract a proton leading to the formation of a more conjugated diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group and the adjacent hydroxyl group allow for some kind of electrocyclic reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the oxygen, leading to an elimination. The structure is such that when the base abstracts a proton, the molecule could lose a water molecule (since the O- would have a lone pair) and form a double bond. But where?

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. The Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene, but I'm not sure if this molecule has that. Alternatively, a Claisen rearrangement, which involves allyl vinyl ethers, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which involves carbocation shifts. But without an acid, I'm not sure. Wait, but the base is strong, so maybe it's more about deprotonation leading to an elimination.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group. Perhaps the base deprotonates the alcohol, making an alkoxide, and then the molecule undergoes an elimination, leading to the formation of a bicyclic compound. Let me think about the structure. The spiro compound has two rings connected at the same carbon. If elimination occurs, perhaps the rings could join to form a larger ring.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the vinyl group, leading to some sort of diradical or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are for a ketone formation. Wait, if the base induces an oxidation but in this case, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the double bond, leading to a more substituted double bond, thus an E2 elimination.

Wait, let me think about the product options for A.

Option A) (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one. That's a bicyclic ketone. So the product is a ketone, suggesting that an elimination and oxidation happened.

Wait, but in the reaction, the starting material is an alcohol. So perhaps the base deprotonates the alcohol, leading to an alkoxide, which then loses a proton to form a double bond, and perhaps a ring forms leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a elimination leading to a conjugated diene, and then a hydride shift occurs, forming a ketone.

Wait, another angle: when a diol is treated with a base, like in the Cope elimination, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the base inducing a ring-opening.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formation of annulenes via base-induced elimination. For example, the dehydro-Diels-Alder reaction, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the base causes the elimination of H2O, but that would require the presence of an acid to form a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a double bond, and the molecule cyclizes to form a bridge, resulting in a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the base induces a [1,2]-shift or [1,3]-shift. If a hydride or alkyl group shifts, it could form a more stable carbocation, which then would lose a proton to form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but I don't think so because the conditions don't include a strong base and a metal like Na in ethanol.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reaction is with KH (a strong base) in THF, then H+.

Maybe the base deprotonates the primary alcohol, making an alkoxide, which is a good leaving group. But wait, in an E2 reaction, the base would abstract a proton that's anti to the leaving group. But in this case, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the oxygen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Alternatively, the elimination could form a bridge, creating a bicyclic compound.

Wait, if I imagine the spiro structure, perhaps the base causes the oxygen to lose a proton, and then the molecule undergoes a ring-opening, forming a bridge. Alternatively, the elimination could form a new ring.

Let me think about the product options. Option A for product A is (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one. Bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane means a 11-carbon skeleton with bridge lengths of 5, 3, and 1. Hmm, that makes a norbornane-like structure, but bigger.

Wait, the starting material is a spiro compound with a non (9 carbons) chain. If the molecule loses two carbons (but that's not likely), perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a bridge formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces an elimination that forms a ketone. For that, maybe a conjugated dienol is formed, which undergoes some rearrangement. Or maybe an aldol-like condensation occurs, but I don't see an aldehyde or ketone to condense with.

Wait, another thought: the base could abstract a proton leading to the formation of a conjugated diene, and the molecule could undergo a ring-closing process, forming a bicyclic compound with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but that requires an aldehyde or ketone and an enol. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a double bond, and the molecule undergoes a [4+2] cycloaddition, but without a dienophile, I don't think so.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the base leading to ring formation. Alternatively, the elimination leads to the formation of a bicyclic ketone due to a hydride shift.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on Reaction A. Let me look at Reaction B to see if that helps.

Reaction B is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol treated with acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) in the presence of LDA as a base. LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, typically used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates or to deprotonate acidic hydrogens like those in alcohols.

So, (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is an allylic alcohol. The structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂OH, but wait, no. Wait, pent-2-en-1-ol is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂OH? Wait, no. Wait, pent-2-en-1-ol is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂? Let me draw it correctly. The formula would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂OH. Wait, no, because pent-2-en-1-ol would be HOCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂ with a double bond between C2 and C3, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, pent-2-en-1-ol: the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂-OH? No, wait, no. Let me count the carbons: position 1 is the OH, so the structure is HOCH₂CH₂CH=CHCH3? No, wait, pent-2-en-1-ol would be HOCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂ with double bond between C2 and C3? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂OH. Wait, that would be pent-2-en-1-ol: the OH is on C1, the double bond between C2 and C3. So structure is CH₂(OH)CH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, no, because that's butenol. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should better imagine it as HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH-CH3? No, because that's pent-3-en-1-ol. Oh wait, the correct structure for (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-OH. No, that can't be because the double bond is between C2 and C3, but the OH is on C1. So structure is HOCH₂CH₂CH=CH2? Wait, no, because that's four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should just think of it as (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol: the OH is on C1, double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituents are arranged in the E configuration.

So when this is treated with acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) in the presence of LDA, a strong base, what happens?

Acetyl bromide is an acylating agent. In the presence of a base, the alcohol could undergo an acylation reaction. But LDA is a strong base, so perhaps it deprotonates the alcohol first. However, the pKa of an allylic alcohol is lower (like around 18-20), so LDA can deprotonate it easily.

Once the alcohol is deprotonated to form the alkoxide, the acetyl bromide can act as an electrophile, and the alkoxide can attack the acetyl group.

So the reaction would proceed as: the base (LDA) deprotonates the allylic alcohol to form the conjugate base (an enolate), which then reacts with acetyl bromide to form an acetylated product.

Wait, but wait. (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol: when deprotonated, the enolate could form, but the position where the base abstracts a proton depends on where the alpha hydrogens are. The allylic alcohol has hydrogens on C2 and C3.

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-OH. Wait, no, that's not correct because the alcohol is on C1. So the structure is HOCH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me get this right. The formula is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol, which would be:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that's four carbons. Wait, pent is five carbons. So, the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-OH? No, the OH is on C1? Wait, perhaps it's:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's pentanol, not enol. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The correct structure for (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is:

CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-OH. Wait, that's four carbons. No, wait, the formula would be CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-OH is but-2-en-1-ol. So pent-2-en-1-ol would be:

CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, that's six carbons. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂OH)-CH3? No, that's 3-penten-1-ol. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's not crucial for the reaction type.

In any case, when treated with LDA, which is a strong base, the alcohol becomes deprotonated, forming an enolate. The enolate then reacts with acetyl bromide, which is an acylating agent. The reaction would substitute the bromide with the enolate's oxygen, leading to an acetylated product.

Wait, but wait. Acetyl bromide is CH3COBr. When an enolate attacks, the acylation would occur at the alpha position. So the enolate would attack the carbonyl, leading to substitution of Br with the enolate. So the product would be an acetylated alcohol.

Wait, but the options for B are either lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate or 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid, or similar. Wait, let me look at the options again.

The options for B are:

Option A) B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate.

Option B) B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate.

Option C) B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid.

Option D) B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid.

Wait, so in the reaction, the product for B is either an enolate (lithium salt)
