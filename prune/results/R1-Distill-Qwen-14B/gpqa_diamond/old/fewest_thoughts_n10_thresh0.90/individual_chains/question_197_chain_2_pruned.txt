Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Alright, let's break it down.

First, I need to look at the spectral data. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But looking closer, the peak around 1720 cm-1 is prominent. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe it's a carbonyl-containing aromatic compound, like a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a pretty high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but in carboxylic acids, the O-H proton is usually broad, but that's around 10-12 ppm as a singlet. So maybe that's the case here. But wait, sometimes aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like from a ketone, but that's less likely.

Then there's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like aromatic protons, likely para-substituted. Because the doublets each have 2H, so perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. Wait, or maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene with neighboring protons? No, for para substitution, the protons across from each other would be split into doublets. So, perhaps the substituents are in para positions, making it para-substituted.

Then, the NMR continues: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a terminal methyl group, perhaps from an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H is another methyl, maybe attached to something else. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 group, and the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a CH that's connected to a carbonyl group or something else.

Putting this together, the structure could be a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group. The substituent might be a side chain. For example, maybe a ketone or an ester. But wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a carbonyl in an ester or a ketone. But carboxylic acids have a peak around 1700 cm-1, but they also have a broad O-H stretch. The IR here has the 3400-2500 region, which could be an O-H or maybe an N-H, but in the absence of other peaks, probably O-H for a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the 10.5 ppm peak is a carboxylic acid proton, then the IR would have a broad O-H around 2500-3000 as well. But in the given IR, the 3400–2500 region is a broad one. So, could this be a carboxylic acid? Let me think. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a substituent that is a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but the substituent in the benz
