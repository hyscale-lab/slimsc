Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal in shape, and it's oscillating along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a particular wavelength, lambda. 

The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is a function f of lambda and the angle theta. They say that the maximum power is A, and we're asked to find the fraction of A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also determine the possible form of f from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution and the oscillation direction. Since the charge distribution is spheroidal with symmetry along the z-axis, the radiation should have a particular pattern.

Wait, in dipole radiation, which is a common example, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) depends on the angle theta from the dipole's axis. The intensity or power radiated per unit solid angle for a dipole varies as sin^2(theta), if I'm not mistaken. So for a dipole, the radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (theta = 90 degrees) and zero along the axis (theta = 0 and 180 degrees). 

But wait, this is a different case. The charge distribution is spheroidal, so maybe the radiation pattern is different. But I'm not too sure. Maybe it's a dipole-like radiation, or perhaps it's quadrupole or something else. But I think for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is sin^2(theta).

Wait, the problem says it's oscillating, so it's probably an oscillating dipole. So the function f for the power per unit solid angle would depend on theta as sin^2(theta), I think. But wait, I've heard that for a dipole, the electric field radiation falls as 1/r, and the power (which is E squared over impedance) would then fall as 1/r^2.

Wait, in terms of angular dependence, the power per unit solid angle (which has units of power per steradian) for a dipole is proportional to (sin^2 theta) multiplied by some function of lambda and the frequency. But I'm trying to recall the exact form.

Let me think about the radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole. The power per unit solid angle, I believe, is proportional to (1/(lambda^4)) multiplied by sin^2(theta), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be proportional to (lambda)^{-something} and the sin^2(theta).

Wait, no. The radiation power from a dipole is given by the dipole formula. The total power radiated is ( (e^2 a^2 omega^4 )/(6 pi epsilon_0 c^3)), where a is the dipole moment's maximum displacement, and omega is the angular frequency. But the power per unit solid angle is the total power divided by 4 pi, multiplied by the radiation pattern.

Wait, maybe
