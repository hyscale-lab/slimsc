Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, first I should recall what SMEFT is about. SMEFT is an effective field theory framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators suppressed by some high energy scale. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

Symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the laws of nature. Effective theories respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which is the Standard Model in this case. Oh right, the Standard Model has certain symmetries like Lorentz symmetry, but wait, Poincare is different. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh, but in effective theories, I think they must respect the same symmetries as the original theory, like Lorentz. But what about Poincare?

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations, boosts), while Poincare includes those plus translations, which is spacetime translation symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorent covariant theory, so operators must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. But do they necessarily have to respect translations? Because effective theories are usually defined up to certain scales, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think that SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

Now Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes the group of Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the theory is built in a way that respects translations, then Poincare would be a symmetry. But wait, effective theories usually include all possible operators consistent with the symmetries of the original theory. The Standard Model is Poincare invariant, so SMEFT must also respect Poincare symmetry. Hence, all SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Next, CP and CPT symmetries. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The Standard Model is symmetric under CPT, but not necessarily under CP. Wait, I remember that the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry because of phenomena like CP violation in the strong interaction (like the CKM matrix). So if the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT, which is a generalization, must also respect the same symmetries. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP symmetry.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP if the Standard Model already does. So operators in SMEFT can have CP violation if they are allowed by the SM to do so. But the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, does that mean SMEFT doesn't need to respect it either? Or is it that operators in SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the SM?

I think all operators in SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. Because SMEFT is an extension, so any symmetry that the Standard Model has must also be a symmetry of SMEFT. But the Standard Model does not have CP symmetry, so SMEFT doesn't have to have CP symmetry either. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The SM has CPT symmetry, which is a bigger symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect the same CPT symmetry as the SM.

But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM respects CPT, then SMEFT must as well. But if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP either.

So the four options are 1, 2, 3, 4. The question is which of these must be respected by all operators.

Thus, in SMEFT, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4), but they don't have to respect CP symmetry (3). So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. Wait, but wait, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation. So if operators must respect Lorentz, does that mean they automatically respect Poincare? Or is Poincare a separate consideration?

Wait, wait, SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. But what about Poincare? Poincare includes translations. So, for example, the action is Poincare invariant — meaning that the terms in the action are invariant under translations. So if the action is written in terms of operators, each operator would have to be a Lorentz scalar, but for the action to be translation-invariant, the operators must have positive mass dimension so that the action (integral of operator) has the correct dimension.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all the operators are Lorentz scalars. So operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Poincare symmetry would require the theory to be invariant under translations as well. But SMEFT is a field theory, so the fields can be shifted, and the theory remains the same. So yes, it is Poincare-invariant. So operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry.

But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT is only required to be Lorentz-invariant, but not necessarily Poincare? Because in some cases, maybe the operators can involve terms that don't respect translations, but in reality, since the theory must make sense as a quantum field theory, it must respect Poincare. So I think Poincare symmetry is also required.

So, which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT? 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Option C is 1,2,4. But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. The question gives options A, B, C, D. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So the correct would be C) 1,2,4.

But wait, wait a minute. I thought that SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, but do they have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. But in effective field theories, the operators are local and constructed to be translationally invariant, so yes, they must respect Poincare.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

But wait another point: CPT symmetry. The Standard Model has CPT symmetry. So SMEFT must respect CPT as well. So all operators must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So the answer would be option C: 1,2,4.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM), as SMEFT is a generalization of the SM. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry, but not CP symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT must also respect these symmetries unless explicitly violated by the SM.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. This is a fundamental requirement for SMEFT operators.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is formulated as a quantum field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry to maintain consistency with the SM.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the strong interaction. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT must also respect this symmetry as a generalization of the SM.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
