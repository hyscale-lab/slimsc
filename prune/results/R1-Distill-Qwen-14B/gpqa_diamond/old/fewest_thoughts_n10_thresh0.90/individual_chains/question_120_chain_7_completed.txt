Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which means they're spread out evenly in space. I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star from us. Oh right, parallax (pl) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth's orbit, and it's inversely proportional to the distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. Oh, so they're asking about the density of stars in terms of parallax. Let me think about the formula. Parallax pl is 1/distance d, so d = 1/pl. But since stars are uniformly distributed, their number density in space should be constant. So the number per unit volume is the same everywhere.

But how does that translate to the number per unit parallax? Let's see. If I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4πd² dr. The number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume, so N = n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density.

But parallax pl = 1/d, so d = 1/pl. Let me rewrite the volume in terms of pl. So d is 1/pl, dr would be the change in d. Let's find dr in terms of pl. Since d = 1/pl, dr = -1/(pl²) d pl. Wait, because pl is inversely proportional to d, so when pl increases by a small amount d pl, d decreases by d pl * (1/pl²). Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the signs, but maybe I can just consider the magnitude here.

So, the volume element in terms of pl would be 4π (1/pl)^2 * (d pl / (pl^2)). Wait, let me do that substitution. Since d = 1/pl, dr = (d pl) / (pl^2) (Wait, no, the derivative of pl with respect to d is -1/d². So dr = (d pl) * (-1/(pl²)). But since I'm considering a small range of pl, say from pl to pl + d pl, the corresponding d would be from 1/pl to 1/(pl + d pl). Hmm, maybe it's easier to express dr in terms of d pl.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the number of stars per unit parallax. The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is N = n * 4πd² dr. So, the number per unit dr is n * 4πd². But we want it per unit plx. So, since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So d² is 1/plx². Substituting, we get N/dr = n *4π (1/plx²).

But we need N per unit plx, which is N/(d plx). So we have N = n *4π (1/plx²) dr. But dr is related to d plx. Since plx = 1/d, d plx = -1/d² dr. So dr = -d² d plx. Wait, but d plx is positive if plx increases, which would mean dr is negative. Since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps the negative just indicates direction, but for counts, we can take the absolute value.

So, dr = (1/plx²) d plx. So substituting into N, N = n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx. Because dr = (1/(plx²)) d plx. So N = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx. 

Wait, that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's option A, which is 1/plx^4. But wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me recheck the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of stars per unit volume and how that translates into parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume element is proportional to the volume. The volume between plx and plx + d plx would be a spherical shell. But wait, in terms of distance, that shell's volume would be 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness in distance. But since plx is 1/d, dr is the change in distance corresponding to a small change in plx.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars per unit plx interval is proportional to the volume element per unit plx. So the volume element is 4πd² dr, and we can express this in terms of plx.

Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So d² = 1/(plx)^2.

What's dr in terms of plx? Since plx = 1/d, differentiating both sides: d plx = -1/d² dr. So dr = - d² d plx. But d = 1/plx, so dr = -(1/plx^2) d plx.

So substituting into the volume element:

Volume element = 4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx )

But since d plx is positive when plx increases, the negative sign might indicate direction. So we'll take the absolute value, so:

Volume element = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) d plx ) = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * Volume element, which is n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx interval decreases as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So if plx increases, how does the number per unit plx change? Because as plx gets larger (meaning the stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit plx decreases more steeply.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's the conclusion. But earlier I thought maybe it's 1/plx^2 because of the area. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell is 4π d² dr. But since stars are uniformly distributed, the number is also proportional to the volume. So the number per unit parallax would be the number per shell per d plx.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The number density (n) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV.

dV can be expressed in terms of plx. Let's model the volume element between plx and plx + d plx. The corresponding distance d goes from 1/plx to 1/(plx + d plx). So the thickness dr in distance is 1/(plx) - 1/(plx + d plx) = [ (plx + d plx) - plx ] / [ plx (plx + d plx) ) ] = d plx / [ plx^2 + plx d plx ]

Approximately, since d plx is small, this is about (d plx)/(plx^2). So dr ≈ d plx / plx².

So the volume of the shell is 4π d² dr =4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx^2) ) = 4 π d² dr= 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2) ) = 4 π (d plx) / plx^4.

So number of stars in this shell is n * 4 π (d plx) / plx^4. So per unit plx (d plx), the number is (n * 4 π) / plx^4.

So as plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx interval decreases as 1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be option A, 1/plx^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 1/plx^2. Hmm, perhaps I got confused between area and volume. Wait, the area is 4π d², which is proportional to 1/plx^2, but when you consider the volume element (which is area times thickness), you get another 1/plx^2 factor. Hmm, so the volume element is proportional to 1/plx^4, which makes the number of stars per unit plx proportional to 1/plx^4.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). The number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Since the number density of stars \( n \) is constant, the number of stars in the shell is \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dr \).

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = 1/\text{plx} \) and \( dr = -1/\text{plx}^2 d\text{plx} \) (from the relationship \( \text{plx} = 1/d \)). The volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{-1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume element is then:

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \). As parallax increases, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases more steeply.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
