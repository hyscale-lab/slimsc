Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says I have three solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A through D, with some numbers in between.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should calculate the moles of each acid and base and see what's left after the neutralization reactions. 

Let me list out each component's moles. Moles are calculated by concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). But since the volumes are in mL, I need to convert them to liters first.

Starting with CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. Its volume is 500 mL, so 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol.

Next, HCl. Volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 L. Concentration is 0.2 M. So moles HCl = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Concentration is 0.3 M. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^- because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So moles of OH^- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely into H+ and Cl^- ions. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

The acetic acid, CH3COOH, is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. It stays mostly as CH3COOH, but it does donate some H+ ions. But since I'm dealing with neutralization, maybe I should first figure out how the H+ and OH- react before considering the weak acid's contribution.

So, the total H+ comes from HCl and any H+ from the dissociation of CH3COOH. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it's going to react with the H+ from HCl and any available H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the solution, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol. So when H+ and OH- meet, they neutralize each other to form water. So let's calculate which is in excess.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.
Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So OH- is in excess. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ after reaction: 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10. Negative, which means all H+ is neutralized, and there's excess OH-.

Wait, but wait. The OH- is 0.18, H+ is 0.08. So 0.08 moles of OH- will react with 0.08 moles of H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- excess. So the solution is basic because there's excess OH-.

But wait, what about the acetic acid? Because acetic acid is a weak acid, it can donate H+. So I need to consider if any of it reacts with the excess OH-.

So the OH- that's left is 0.10 mol. Let's see if that can react with CH3COOH. The reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So how much CH3COOH is present? 0.05 mol. Excess OH- is 0.10 mol. So the OH- can react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH because that's all that's available.

So OH- after reacting with CH3COOH: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, because each OH- would take one CH3COOH. So 0.05 moles of OH- would react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and water.

So after that, the OH- left is 0.05 mol. So the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- in the total solution volume.

Wait, what's the total volume of the solution? Let me calculate that. 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So concentration of OH- is moles / volume = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, the pOH would be -log(0.04167). Let me compute that. Log(0.04167) is log(4.167e-2). Hmm, log(4) is about 0.6, 4.167 is about 0.62. So log(4.167e-2) is about 1.38. So pOH is 1.38, which makes pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. Wait, but wait—did I account for all the reactions correctly?

Wait, let me recheck. The initial H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol; OH- is 0.18. So after neutralization, 0.08 H+ is used, leaving 0.10 OH-.

But wait, that's not right. Because when you subtract H+ and OH-, the neutralization would be 0.08 H+ and 0.08 OH- react, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, this OH- would react with CH3COOH. There's 0.05 mol of CH3COOH. So the OH- would consume all of it, but only 0.05 OH- is used, leaving 0.05 OH-.

Wait, no. Because each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of CH3COOH. So if OH- is 0.10 mol and CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, then CH3COOH is completely neutralized, and there's 0.05 mol of OH- left.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Calculating pOH: -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38. Then pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Could there be another reaction? Because when you mix a strong base with a weak acid, like in this case, the OH- would first deprotonate the weak acid (if any H+ is available). But in this case, the H+ from HCl is completely neutralized by OH- from Ba(OH)2, and then the excess OH- reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH).

But another thought: when Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it might react with the HCl first, then any remaining OH- would react with the CH3COOH. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, but wait—Let me think again about the neutralization steps.

1. H+ from HCl (0.08 mol) and OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 mol) react.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So initial H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. After reaction, OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

2. Now, this excess OH- (0.10 mol) will react with any available H+ or in this case, the weak acid.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+. So OH- will react with CH3COOH as follows:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

The moles of CH3COOH available are 0.05 mol. So the OH- can consume all 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH-.

So now, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH-.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

So OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62, so that should be the answer.

But wait another thing—could the presence of Ba^2+ or Cl^- ions affect anything? I think not, because Ba^2+ is a spectator ion, as are Cl^- ions from HCl. They don't participate in the neutralization reactions, so they don't affect the pH calculation.

So the conclusion is that the pH is approximately 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solution contains three components: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid, a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). 

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
- **CH₃COOH**:  
  Moles = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
- **HCl**:  
  Moles = \( 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, it provides \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

### Step 2: Neutralization of H⁺ and OH⁻
- The H⁺ from HCl is \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \), and the OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ is \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
- The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) neutralizes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻, leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \) of excess OH⁻.

### Step 3: Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
- The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
  \( \text{OH⁻} + \text{CH₃COOH} \to \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \).  
- CH₃COOH is \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), so it neutralizes all \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

### Step 4: Calculate OH⁻ concentration
- The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
- The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
  \( [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 5: Calculate pH
- The pOH is:  
  \( \text{pOH} = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
- The pH is:  
  \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.
