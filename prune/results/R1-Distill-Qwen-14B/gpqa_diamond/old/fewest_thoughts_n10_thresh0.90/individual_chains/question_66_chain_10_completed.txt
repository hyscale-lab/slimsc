Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with certain symmetries. The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, wait. Let me think. I remember that the SMEFT is built by extending the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators, but it must respect certain fundamental symmetries. I think the first thing is Lorentz symmetry. Because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, and the SMEFT is just adding terms that are consistent with that. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be there.

What about Poincaré symmetry (option 2)? Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. Since the Standard Model is a local theory, it respects Poincaré. But wait, in SMEFT, when you add higher-dimensional terms, they are typically written in a way that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So if the original model respects Poincaré, I think the operators do too. So option 2 is probably correct.

CP symmetry (option 3) is a bit trickier. I remember that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry due to things like the CKM matrix and certain terms. So in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I think no. Because the SMEFT can include operators that break CP, but only if the SM already doesn't have it. Wait, but the question is about what must be respected by all operators. So if the SM doesn't have a symmetry, then the SMEFT operators don't have to either. So probably, CP symmetry isn't a required symmetry for all operators. So option 3 is probably not correct.

CPT symmetry (option 4) is another thing. CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. I think all operators must respect CPT symmetry because it's a basic requirement for any Lorentz-invariant theory. Because if a theory is Lorentz symmetric, then it must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but is that the case? Let me think again. Lorentz symmetry implies CPT, right? Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, you can boost into a frame where a particle and its antiparticle are treated symmetrically. So yes, CPT must be respected if Lorentz symmetry is. So if all SMEFT operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT.

So putting it together: Which symmetries must all operators respect? Let's see the options. The given options are 1,2,3,4.

The question is: which of the options (1-4) must be respected by all SMEFT operators?

Symmetry 1 (Lorentz) must be respected because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory.

Symmetry 2 (Poincaré) must be respected because SMEFT inherits the SM's symmetries, and the SM respects Poincaré. So operators are written in a way that respects this.

Symmetry 3 (CP) is not necessarily respected because, for example, the SM itself doesn't have CP symmetry. So SMEFT can include operators that break CP, but not all. Wait, no, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if even one operator doesn't respect it, the symmetry isn't a must. But in SMEFT, you can have operators that violate CP, so C is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. So option 3 is out.

Symmetry 4 (CPT) must be respected because Lorentz symmetry is there, which implies CPT.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincaré), and 4 (CPT). So which option includes these?

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct answer.

The options are:

A) 1,2 → misses CPT

B) 3,4 → no, doesn't have Lorentz and Poincaré

C)1,2,4 → yes, that's correct

D)1,3,4 → includes CP, which isn't required for all


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators while respecting certain fundamental symmetries. The question asks which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (Option 1):** SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a foundational requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (Option 2):** Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since the Standard Model respects Poincaré symmetry and SMEFT is built to extend the Standard Model, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry (Option 3):** The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like the CKM matrix and certain terms. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as it is not a symmetry of the Standard Model or SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry (Option 4):** CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant and Lorentz symmetry implies CPT symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
