Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about finding the probability of getting specific measurement outcomes for two observables, P and Q, when measured in sequence. The state vector is given, and the operators for P and Q are provided as matrices. The measurements are P first, then Q, and we want the probability that P gives 0 and Q gives -1.

Wait, I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. And when you measure, the system collapses into an eigenstate of the operator corresponding to the measured eigenvalue.

So, the process here would be: first, measure P, get outcome 0. Then, measure Q on the new state, get outcome -1. We need the combined probability of these two events happening in sequence.

Let me break it down.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when we measure P, the state will collapse into one of the eigenvectors of P, right?

Looking at the matrix for P:

P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],
     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
     [0, 1/√2, 0]]

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way. The matrix P looks a bit symmetric. Let me see:

The structure is like a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal except for the middle element which is also zero. Wait, no, the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0? Because in the first row, first element is 0, second row second is 0, third row third is 0. So the diagonal is all zeros. So the trace is zero, which suggests that the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Hmm, perhaps the eigenvalues are symmetric. Let's think about it.

Wait, another approach: maybe find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues for P. Since the matrix is symmetric, it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps guessing the eigenstates. Let's consider possible eigenvectors.

Looking for eigenvectors where P|v> = λ |v>.

For example, let's think about the standard basis vectors.

Take e1 = (1,0,0)^T. Then P*e1 is [0, 1/√2, 0]^T. So P*e1 = (0, 1/√2, 0). Not a multiple of e1, so e1 isn't an eigenvector.

Similarly for e2 = (0,1,0)^T: P*e2 is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]^T. Again, not a multiple of e2.

Hmm. Maybe try symmetric or antisymmetric vectors.

Another approach: The matrix P seems to be a symmetric tri-diagonal matrix with zero diagonal and 1/√2 on the off-diagonal elements except for the (3,3) position, which is zero.

Wait, let me compute the matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Wait, maybe this matrix is the position representation of a spin-1 system in some direction? Or maybe it's related to the Pauli matrices scaled up. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 or something similar.

Wait, maybe the matrix P is proportional to the square of some operator, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's compute the characteristic equation.

The matrix P is:

[ [0, a, 0],
  [a, 0, a],
  [0, a, 0] ]

where a = 1/√2.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is:

| -λ   a      0    |
| a   -λ     a    |
| 0    a    -λ    |

Let me calculate this determinant.

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * det( [ [ -λ, a ], [a, -λ ] ]) - a * det( [ [a, a], [0, -λ ] ]) + 0 * ... 

Wait, the cofactor expansion for the first row.

So,

= -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] - a * [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ) ] + 0 * (...) 

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ ( λ^2 - a^2 )

Second term: -a [ -a λ ] = -a (-a λ) = a^2 λ

So overall:

= -λ (λ² - a²) + a² λ

= -λ^3 + λ a² + a² λ

= -λ^3 + 2 a² λ

Set equal to zero:

-λ^3 + 2 a² λ = 0 → λ (-λ² + 2 a²) )= 0

So solutions are λ = 0, λ = sqrt(2) a, λ = -sqrt(2) a.

Given a = 1/√2, so sqrt(2) a = sqrt(2) * (1/√2) )= 1.

So eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Ah, so P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Therefore, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

Now, the state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that must be normalized, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector should have unit norm.

Let me compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state is not normalized. Hmm.

But wait, in the problem statement, the system is in the state (-1, 2, 1). So let's compute the normalized state.

Wait, but maybe the state is already given as a column vector without normalization, and perhaps the probabilities are to be calculated as is. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using non-normalized vectors, but I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are always normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

So the normalized state vector would be (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention normalization, so perhaps I should proceed with the vector as is. But wait, the probabilities would then be based on the squared moduli of the components. Hmm.

Wait, when you compute probabilities, you take the inner product of the state with an eigenvector, square it, etc. So perhaps the state is already normalized, but in this case, the given vector has a norm squared of 6, so it's not. Therefore, perhaps the given state is not normalized, which complicates things. Or maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed regardless, because the problem's context might assume the state is normalized, but I'm not sure. Let's proceed.

So first, the initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T.

Wait, but let me check the norm: |ψ> · |ψ> = (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 6. So |ψ> has length sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be |ψ> / sqrt(6).

But the problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps the state is given as is, and when computing probabilities, we just compute the inner products as is. Hmm.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state has to be normalized. So perhaps the state given is actually normalized, but maybe the components are written with some scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the state isn't normalized, and the probability is computed with the non-normalized vector. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the initial state can be expressed as a combination of the eigenvectors of P, and then we can compute the probabilities based on that.

So let's find the eigenvectors of P.

We have eigenvalues λ=1, 0, -1.

For λ=1:

(P - I)|v> =0.

So the matrix becomes:

[-1, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -1]

We can write the equations:

- v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 --> v1 = (1/√2) v2
(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0
(1/√2) v2 - v3 =0 --> v3 = (1/√2) v2

From first equation, v1 = (1/√2) v2.

From third equation, v3 = (1/√2) v2.

Substituting into second equation:

(1/√2)(1/√2 v2) ) - v2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 v2) ) =0

Compute each term:

(1/2 v2 ) - v2 + (1/2 v2 ) = (1/2 + 1/2) v2 - v2 = v2 - v2 =0.

So it's satisfied. So the eigenvector for λ=1 is proportional to (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 )

Wait, let me plug in v2 =√2, then v1 =1, v3=1. So the eigenvector is (1, √2, 1). Alternatively, normalized: Let me compute its norm squared: 1^2 + (√2)^2 +1^2 =1+2+1=4. So normalized, it's (1, √2, 1)/2.

Similarly for λ= -1:

(P + I)|v> =0.

Matrix becomes:

[1, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 1]

The equations:

v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1 = - (1/√2) v2
(1/√2) v1 + v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0
(1/√2) v2 + v3 =0 → v3 = - (1/√2) v2

Substituting v1 and v3 into second equation:

(1/√2)(-1/√2 v2 ) + v2 + (1/√2)(-1/√2 v2 ) =0

= (-1/2 v2 ) + v2 + (-1/2 v2 ) = ( (-1/2 -1/2) v2 ) + v2 = (-v2) + v2 =0.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (-1, √2, -1) — wait, wait, let's see:

If v2 =√2, then v1= - (1/√2)*√2 )= -1, and v3= - (1/√2)*√2 )= -1.

So the eigenvector is (-1, √2, -1). Its norm squared is 1 + 2 +1=4, so normalized it's (-1, √2, -1)/2.

Now for λ=0:

P |v> =0 |v>.

So the equations:

(1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0
(1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → v1 = -v3
v2 =0 (from first equation, but also third row).

So from third row, (1/√2) v2 =0, which is already satisfied since v2=0.

So v2=0, and v1 = -v3.

Let v3 = a, then v1= -a.

So the eigenvector is (-a, 0, a). For a=1, it's (-1,0,1). Its norm squared is 1 +0 +1=2, so normalized as (-1,0,1)/sqrt(2).

So to recap, the eigenvectors are:

λ=1: (1, √2, 1)/2 → let's call this |1⟩.
λ=0: (-1, 0, 1)/√2 → |0⟩.
λ=-1: (-1, √2, -1)/2 → |-1⟩.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

We can express |ψ> as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P.

So, |ψ> = a |1⟩ + b |0⟩ + c |-1⟩.

We need to find the coefficients a, b, c.

Let me compute the inner products.

a = ⟨1| ψ⟩ = [ (1/2), (√2/2), (1/2) ] · [-1, 2,1 ]^T.

= (1/2)(-1) + (√2/2)(2) + (1/2)(1)

= (-1/2) + (√2) + (1/2)
= (√2) + 0 = √2.

Similarly, b = ⟨0| ψ⟩ = [ (-1/√2), 0, (1/√2) ] · [-1, 2, 1 ].

= (-1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (1/√2)(1)
= (1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2)
= 2/√2 = √2.

c = ⟨-1| ψ⟩ = [ (-1/2), (√2/2), (-1/2) ] · [-1, 2, 1 ].

= (-1/2)(-1) + (√2/2)(2) + (-1/2)(1)
= (1/2) + √2 + (-1/2)
= √2 + (1/2 -1/2 )=√2.

Wait, but wait, because the state |ψ> is not normalized. Because when I compute a^2 + b^2 + c^2, I get:

( (√2)^2 ) + ( (√2)^2 ) + ( (√2)^2 ) = 2 +2 +2 =6. Which is the same as the squared norm of |ψ>, which is 6.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 =6, which matches the norm squared of |ψ> (which is 6). So it's correct.

So the probabilities for each eigenvalue when measuring P are |a|^2 /6, |b|^2 /6, |c|^2 /6, because the state is not normalized.

Wait, no. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is supposed to be normalized, so when you compute probabilities, you take the square of the coefficients. But since in this case, |a|² + |b|² + |c|² =6, and |ψ> has norm sqrt(6), the probabilities would be |a|² /6, etc.

Wait, let me think again. The state |ψ> is not normalized. So if someone measures P in state |ψ>, the probability of getting λ=1 is |a|^2 / (||ψ||^2 ), which is |a|² /6.

Similarly, for λ=0, it's |b|² /6, and for λ=-1, |c|² /6.

In our case, a=√2, so |a|²=2. Similarly, |b|²=2, |c|²=2.

So all three probabilities are 2/6 = 1/3 each.

Wait, that can't be right because 2+2+2=6, and each is 1/3.

So when you measure P, you have 1/3 chance to get 1, 1/3 to get 0, and 1/3 to get -1.

But the question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

So, first, the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

After that, the system collapses into the eigenvector |0⟩, which is (-1,0,1)/√2.

Now, we need to measure Q on this new state.

So the state after measuring P=0 is |0⟩ = (-1,0,1)/√2.

Now, what are the eigenvalues of Q?

Looking at the matrix Q:

Q = [[1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, -1]]

This is a diagonal matrix. So the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1.

So when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

But the state after P=0 is |0⟩ = (-1,0,1)/√2.

Wait, let me compute the components of |0⟩.

In terms of the standard basis, |0⟩ is expressed as:

|0⟩ = (-1/√2) |e1⟩ + 0 |e2⟩ + (1/√2) |e3⟩.

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring Q to be 1, 0, or -1, we can project this state onto the eigenvectors of Q.

But wait, Q's eigenstates are the same as the standard basis vectors, since Q is diagonal.

The eigenvectors are:

For eigenvalue 1: |e1⟩ = (1,0,0).

For eigenvalue 0: |e2⟩ = (0,1,0).

For eigenvalue -1: |e3⟩ = (0,0,1).

So, the state |0⟩ is a combination of |e1⟩ and |e3⟩.

Thus, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of |e3⟩ in |0⟩.

The amplitude is (1/√2), so the probability is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Similarly, the probability of measuring Q=1 is ( -1/√2 )^2 = 1/2.

The probability of measuring Q=0 is zero because the component along |e2⟩ is zero.

So, given that we have the state |0⟩, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

So putting it all together: the probability of first measuring P=0 (1/3) and then measuring Q=-1 (1/2) is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 1/6 as the correct answer. Wait, the options are:

A) 1/2

B) 1/3

C) 2/3

D) 1/6

So option D is 1/6.

Wait, but did I make a mistake in normalizing the state?

Wait, earlier I assumed that the state after P=0 is |0⟩, which is normalized. But let me recheck.

The state after measuring P=0 is the eigenvector |0⟩, which has been normalized as (-1,0,1)/√2. So its norm is 1.

So, the probability that Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )=1/6.

So the answer should be D) 1/6.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors.

Wait, let me double-check the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for Q.

Yes, Q is diagonal, so eigenvalues are 1,0,-1, and eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So, the state |0⟩ is (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2).

So the component along |e3⟩ is 1/√2, so the square is (1/√2)^2 =1/2.

So the probability is indeed 1/2.

So yes, the overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 =1/6.

So the correct answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements of the observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on the given state vector. The goal is to find the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

---

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 1, 0, -1 \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

- For \( \lambda = 1 \): \( |1\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \),
- For \( \lambda = 0 \): \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \),
- For \( \lambda = -1 \): \( |-1\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

---

### Step 2: Initial State and Probabilities for \( P \)
The initial state is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The norm of this state is:

\[
\|\psi\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6.
\]

The state is expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of \( P \):

\[
|\psi\rangle = a|1\rangle + b|0\rangle + c|-1\rangle,
\]

where the coefficients are:

\[
a = \langle 1 | \psi \rangle = \sqrt{2}, \quad b = \langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \sqrt{2}, \quad c = \langle -1 | \psi \rangle = \sqrt{2}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \( P = 1, 0, -1 \) are:

\[
P(P=1) = \frac{|a|^2}{\|\psi\|^2} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}, \quad P(P=0) = \frac{|b|^2}{\|\psi\|^2} = \frac{1}{3}, \quad P(P=-1) = \frac{|c|^2}{\|\psi\|^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

---

### Step 3: State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses into the eigenvector \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

---

### Step 4: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is given by the matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

- For \( Q = 1 \): \( |e_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \),
- For \( Q = 0 \): \( |e_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \),
- For \( Q = -1 \): \( |e_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

---

### Step 5: Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \) After \( P = 0 \)
The state after measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |e_3\rangle \) in \( |0\rangle \):

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \langle e_3 | 0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

---

### Step 6: Combined Probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
