Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to visualize the target molecule. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. Wait, so that means the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. And on the same cyclohexane ring, there's a carbaldehyde group attachedâ€”so a formyl group (CHO) at position 1 as well, but wait, the substituent is at position 1, so maybe the formyl is adjacent? Or perhaps it's on the same carbon as the substituent. Hmm, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). And the carbaldehyde is also attached at the same position? Because the name is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane. So perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with at position 1 a CH2 group that's connected to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group, and also has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the same carbon?

Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense because a single carbon can't have two substituents beyond two bonds. Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexane and a hydroxyl, and the same carbon is attached to the aldehyde group. So the structure would be:

The main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, it has a CH2 group. This CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl group) and a hydroxyl (OH) group. So
