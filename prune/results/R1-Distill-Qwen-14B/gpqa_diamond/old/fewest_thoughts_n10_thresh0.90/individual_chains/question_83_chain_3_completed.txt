Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the right pair.

First, let me understand the setup. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. That's a dilution.

Wait, when you dilute a solution, the number of moles remains the same, right? So the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. Let me calculate that. 

Moles of acetic acid before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, no, wait. Because when you add 20 cm³, the total becomes 40 cm³, but the moles stay the same. So yes, the concentration halves. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? The point where moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid. So, let me think about that.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles, right? Because 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001, and adding water doesn't change the moles.

So, for equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added, that's 25% titration.

Wait, but wait another thing. Another way to think about percent titration is the fraction of the acid neutralized. So 25% titration could mean 25% of the acid has been neutralized by the base. Hmm, but I think the first approach is correct in terms of volume added. But perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, when you titrate, the stoichiometry is 1:1 between CH3COOH and NaOH. So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid.

At 25% titration, it could mean that 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. So, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have reacted.

Wait, let me clarify. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% of that would mean 0.25 times the moles at equivalence. So, for the titration, 25% would mean 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. The volume would be moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So that's the same as the other approach. So either way, 25% titration is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, the problem is to find pH at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added and at the equivalence point (10 cm³ added).

Let me tackle each part separately.

First, the pH at 25% titration (2.5 cm³ NaOH added).

The initial solution after dilution is 0.04 L of 0.025 M acetic acid.

When we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The moles of CH3COOH initially are 0.001. Moles of NaOH added are 0.00025, so moles of CH3COOH remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume after adding NaOH is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is about 4.737 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 4.733 approximately). Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267; 5-0.267=4.733). So close enough to 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) 

Let me calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333 (since 5882 ≈ 1/3 of 17647). So log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26, option D has 4.57, etc. Hmm, that's one part.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the concentrations.

Wait, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

Total volume: 0.04 L (40 cm³) + 0.0025 L (2.5 cm³) = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson: 4.73 + log(1/3) → log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

So that's approximately 4.25, which is close to option A (4.26), but let me look at the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

D) 4.57; 6.92

Hmm, so the first part of A is 4.26, which is what I calculated. But let's proceed to the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate.

The moles of NaOH added are 0.001, so the volume is 10 cm³, as earlier.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ =50 cm³ =0.05 L.

The sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles /0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), the solution is basic. So we can calculate the pH using the Kb of acetate.

Kw =1e-14, so Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The acetate ion (A^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. Let's set up the equation.

Let the concentration of OH^- be x. Then,

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 /0.02, since x is very small.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH =14 -4.98≈9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have pH around 9.02. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: equivalence point pH is 8.52.

Option D: 6.92.

Hmm, that's a problem. So my calculation gives ~9.02, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in whether the solution is sodium acetate or something else. No, sodium acetate is correct.

Wait, but wait, when you neutralize acetic acid with NaOH, you get sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it should be basic. So pH should be above 7.

So according to that, the equivalence point pH should be ~9, but none of the options have that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa ≈4.73.

So Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M.

So for the dissociation: CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Let me write the expression again.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Since x is small, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

So, Kb = (x)(x) /0.02 = x² / 0.02 =5.405e-10.

x² =5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH =4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation for equivalence point.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So to neutralize, NaOH also needs to be 0.001 moles.

NaOH concentration is 0.1 M → volume =0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L → 10 cm³. So that's correct.

Total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³ →0.05 L. So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should consider the activity coefficients or other factors? No, I think it's fine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa =4.737.

Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)= (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈0.5405e-9 →5.405e-10.

So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

Wait, at 25% titration, the pH is 4.25, which is near option A's first value. So let's check the options. Option A's equivalence point pH is 8.52. But according to my calculation, it should be around 9.02.

Hmm, but where is option A getting 8.52?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Oh wait, perhaps I didn't account for the dilution correctly. Let me double-check the initial steps.

Wait, the problem says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M *0.02 L =0.001 moles. Correct.

So after adding 20 cm³, the concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

So when adding NaOH, initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001, which is correct.

So I think my earlier calculations are correct, but the equivalence point pH is not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Henderson-Hasselbalch part. Let me recheck.

At 25% titration, the moles of acid remaining are 0.00075, and acetate is 0.00025.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) =1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) →4.73 + (-0.477)=4.253, which is around 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is very close.

Now, the equivalence point. Maybe I should consider whether the solution is 0.02 M acetate or not.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution after equivalence isn't just sodium acetate but also excess NaOH? No, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so no excess strong base. So the solution is just sodium acetate.

Wait another thought: perhaps the initial dilution isn't correct. Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid has 0.001 moles. Adding 20 cm³ of water (dilution factor 2x) gives 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the initial solution's volume, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the 25% is with respect to the initial solution's acid content.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the titration percentage. 25% titration could mean that 25% of the initial volume of the solution has been titrated with NaOH. Wait, that's a different approach.

Wait, in 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the volume of the solution being titrated. The solution after dilution is 40 cm³. So 25% of that is 10 cm³. But wait, that would be 25% of the solution's volume, which isn't the standard way of expressing titration percentage. Usually, percent titration refers to the fraction of the acid neutralized.

But perhaps the problem uses the first approach. So 25% titration is 25% of the solution's volume, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but earlier I thought that 25% titration is 2.5 cm³. But perhaps the question defines it differently.

Wait, let me read the question again: "What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point?"

In titration, the percent titration is usually the percentage of the equivalence point volume that has been reached. So 25% titration means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So if the equivalence point is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³, as I did earlier.

But if the question is using a different definition, then perhaps 25% is 25% of the original solution being titrated. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that 25% titration is 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 2.5 cm³.

Then, pH is 4.25 as before. Then, the equivalence point is 9.02, but that's not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says pH at 25% is 4.57, and equivalence is 6.92.

Hmm, 6.92 is around pH 7, but the solution at equivalence point is basic, so pH should be above 7. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not sodium acetate but something else. No, no, it's correct. At equivalence, it's sodium acetate.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution after equivalence is not just acetate but has excess OH- because of the strong base. No, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized, so the solution is sodium acetate only.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pKa or Ka value.

Wait, the Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that more precisely.

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so pKa is 4.733. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution at equivalence point is not 0.02 M. Let me recheck.

Moles of NaOH at equivalence:0.001. Volume is 50 cm³ (40 +10). So 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should not neglect x in the denominator for the Kb calculation. Let me try that.

So Kb =5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x). Let me solve this more accurately.

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x² ≈5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. So [OH-]=1.04e-5, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

So I'm confident that the equivalence point pH is around 9.02, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the equivalence point. Maybe the solution is a buffer, but that's not possible because all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the solution is just sodium acetate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not using the correct approach for the equivalence point. Let me think differently. Maybe it's considering the solution as a weak base, which it is, but perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for weak bases.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base correctly.

The formula is: [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C). Where C is the concentration of the base.

So, [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) →1.04e-5 as before. So same result.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Let me think about whether the solution is not sodium acetate but something else.

No, I'm confident that the solution after equivalence is sodium acetate.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial moles of acetic acid are different. Let me recheck.

Initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid: 0.05 M *0.02 L =0.001 moles. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ of water:0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001/0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

So, when I add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, moles are 0.1 *0.01=0.001. Correct.

So, yeah, the equivalence point gives pH 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

Wait, let me think again about the first part, the 25% titration.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution at 25% titration is considered differently. Maybe it's the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, so 0.25 *0.001=0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added.

Which is what I did earlier, giving pH 4.25.

So perhaps the options have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is pH 4.57 and 6.92.

Option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

So, with [A^-] =0.00025/0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

[HA] =0.00075 /0.0425≈0.017647 M.

Ratio: 0.005882 /0.017647 ≈0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH =4.73 -0.477=4.253. So 4.25. So option A's first pH is 4.26, which is very close.

The equivalence point is 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me think again.

Wait, when you add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, the total volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration becomes 0.025 M, correct.

So, the initial moles are still 0.001.

Wait, but maybe I should consider activity coefficients or temperature effects, but the problem states 25°C, so it's standard conditions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the approximation for weak acids, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the 25% titration is in terms of the volume of NaOH added relative to the original solution's volume. So the original solution is 40 cm³, 25% of that is 10 cm³. So adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, which is 25% of the solution's volume. But earlier, I thought 25% titration is 25% of the equivalence point volume, which is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, if that's the case, then when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, which is 25% of the 40 cm³ solution, then:

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M *0.01 L=0.001 moles. Wait, but that's the equivalence point. So that can't be right. So that approach doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the buffer solution and see if any of the options fit.

At 25% titration, I found pH≈4.25, which is close to option A's 4.26. So equivalence point would be around 9, but option A's equivalence point is 8.52. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the equivalence point's pH using another approach.

Another approach: perhaps the solution's pH at equivalence point can be found using the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

The acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) = x²/(0.02) ≈5.405e-10 →x²=1.081e-11 →x=1.04e-5 →pOH=4.98 →pH=9.02.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately without approximation.

So,

x² = (5.405e-10) * (0.02 -x)

Assuming x is very small, but let's see.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)(1.081e-11) →approx 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 →≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11)= ~6.576e-6.

So,

x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/2.

We take the positive root:

x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 ≈ (6.570e-6)/2 ≈3.285e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.285e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Wait, that's different from before. So pH is 8.52.

Wait, now that's matching option A's equivalence point pH of 8.52.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier approximation. So why did my initial assumption give a different result?

Because when I didn't ignore x, the result is different.

Wait, the initial assumption was that x is negligible compared to 0.02. But when I actually solve the quadratic, x is about 3.285e-6, which is 3.285e-6 compared to 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So 3.285e-6 is 0.0164% of 0.02, which is small enough to ignore in the denominator. So why did my quadratic solution give a different x?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recalculate the quadratic solution.

The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

= 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = 4.324e-11 approximately.

sqrt(D)= ~6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 → (6.5705995e-6)/2 →3.285e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.285e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah, so earlier when I used the approximation x²/(0.02) =5.405e-10, I got x=1.04e-5. But when I solve the quadratic, I get x=3.285e-6, which is about 3.28e-6.

Wait, that's a big difference. So why?

Because when I solve the quadratic, I get a smaller x, which makes sense because the denominator (0.02 -x) is slightly less than 0.02, but the effect is small.

Wait, but wait, let me plug x=3.285e-6 back into the expression.

x²/(0.02 -x) = ( (3.285e-6)^2 )/(0.02 -3.285e-6) ≈ (1.08e-11)/(0.0199967) →1.08e-11 /0.02 ≈5.4e-10, which matches Kb=5.405e-10.

So the correct x is about 3.285e-6.

So pOH=−log(3.285e-6)=5.48 → pH=14−5.48=8.52.

Oh! So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.

That matches option A's second value.

So that means I made a mistake earlier by neglecting the x in the denominator, which actually leads to a more accurate calculation.

So, to recap:

At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.25.

At equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation step by step:

### Initial Setup
We start with 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Titration with NaOH
We titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is reached when all the acetic acid is neutralized. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, the equivalence point is reached when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. The total volume at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions at the equivalence point is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10 cm³) has been added, which corresponds to:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Since 0.00025 moles of NaOH react with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.3333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.25**.

### pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the formula for \( [\text{OH}^-] \) in a weak base solution:

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - [\text{OH}^-]}.
\]

Assuming \( [\text{OH}^-] \) is small compared to 0.02 M, we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Solving for \( [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.285 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.285 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.25**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options:

- **A) 4.26; 8.52**: Matches the calculated values.
