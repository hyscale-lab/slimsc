Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these titration and neutralization problems, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that when acids and bases are mixed, they undergo neutralization reactions. The key here is to figure out the moles of each acid and base, see which is in excess, and then determine the pH based on the excess.

So, let's break it down step by step. The problem gives me three solutions:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base in these solutions.

Starting with the first solution, CH3COOH. The molarity is 0.1 M, and the volume is 0.5 L (since 500 mL = 0.5 L). Moles = Molarity × Volume. So, 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of acetic acid.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The volume is 0.4 L (400 mL), and molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base. Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-. The volume is 0.3 L, molarity 0.3 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but in reactions, it's the H+ and OH- that neutralize each other. So, I should think about the total H+ and OH- ions.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it will donate some H+ but not completely. But wait, since we're mixing all three solutions, we might need to consider the neutralization between the acids and the base.

So, first, let's find the total moles of H+ from all acids, and the total moles of OH- from the base.

Wait, wait. HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+ completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it only contributes some H+.

But when you mix all solutions, the total volume changes. So the concentrations will change based on the total volume.

Wait, but maybe it's better to first calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which one is in excess.

Wait, but wait. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so let's think about whether it's going to react with the OH- from the base. Similarly, HCl is strong, so it will dissociate completely, providing H+ that can react with OH-.

Wait, but perhaps the OH- from the base will neutralize some of the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH. So, let's proceed.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But since CH3COOH is weak, it's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps we should think of the situation as a neutralization where both HCl and acetic acid contribute to the H+ that reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but OH- is a strong base, so it will react with H+ from the strongest acid first, right? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the order here. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, subtract the OH- from Ba(OH)2, and see what's left.

Wait, let me clarify:

Total moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles (since HCl is strong, it's 0.08 moles H+)
Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it will donate some H+ but not all. So, if we can model it, perhaps we can find the H+ contributed by acetic acid after considering the neutralization with OH-.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Let me think: when you mix all these solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

But perhaps I should first calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but HCl contributes H+ and Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-.

Wait, but when you mix H+ and OH-, they will neutralize each other. So, the net H+ or OH- would determine the pH.

So, let me calculate:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+
Total H+ from CH3COOH: not all, since it's weak. But perhaps we can treat it as a source of H+ that will partially react with OH-.

But wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the moles of H+ from both acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then subtract the OH- from the total H+.

So, total H+ = HCl + CH3COOH.

Wait, but HCl is strong, so all of its H+ is available. CH3COOH is weak, but in solution, it dissociates partially. However, when you mix it with a strong base, some of the H+ from CH3COOH would react with OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should first calculate the total moles of H+ available from all acids, and the total moles of OH- from the base.

But wait, the H+ from CH3COOH is in solution, but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't contribute as much H+ as a strong acid. But when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the CH3COOH, but I'm not sure exactly how much.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to consider all the H+ and OH- in the solution, including that from the weak acid and strong base.

Wait, perhaps the reaction can be considered as the neutralization between the acids (HCl and CH3COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)2), then find the excess H+ or OH-.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.
2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.
3. Now, the OH- will react with H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so perhaps the OH- will first react with the H+ from the strong acid (HCl), and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).

So let's proceed step by step.

First, HCl provides 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 mol OH-.

The OH- will react with H+ from HCl and from CH3COOH, but since HCl is strong, it will donate all its H+ first.

So, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the CH3COOH.

So, initial H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol.

The OH- will react with H+ from HCl first.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.08 mol H+ will react with 0.08 mol OH-.

Therefore, remaining OH- after reacting with HCl is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, this remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- will neutralize one mole of CH3COOH, producing acetate ions.

So, available CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. The remaining OH- is 0.10 mol.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, because that's all there is.

After that, the OH- remaining is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, no. Wait, the OH- is 0.10 mol, and CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. So, all the CH3COOH will react with 0.05 mol of OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

Wait, but wait: when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, the OH- is in excess after HCl. So, after neutralizing all the HCl's H+, the OH- is 0.10 mol. Then, it reacts with CH3COOH, which has 0.05 mol.

So, after reacting CH3COOH with OH-, the OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So, now, the total solution has 0.05 mol of OH- left, and no excess H+.

Wait, but wait, the total volume is now 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. So, pH would be 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, after neutralizing HCl and CH3COOH, the excess OH- is 0.05 mol. So, in 1.2 L, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH is calculated as -log(0.04167). Let me calculate that.

Log(0.04167) is log(4.167e-2). Log(4)=0.60, but 4.167 is about 4.167, so log(4.167) is approximately 0.62, so log(4.167e-2) is 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So, pOH is 1.38, pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So, that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for all the reactions correctly?

HCl is a strong acid, so all its H+ is available. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 first neutralizes the H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH. CH3COOH can donate a proton, but since OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate CH3COOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of CH3COOH can neutralize one mole of OH-. So, since there's 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, it will neutralize 0.05 mol of OH-.

That leaves 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the solution now has an excess of OH-, making it basic. So, the pH is determined by the concentration of OH-.

So, yes, the calculation seems correct. Thus, the pH is approximately 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (HCl and CH3COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)2). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate moles of H+ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Thus, moles of H+ from HCl = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2**:  
   Ba(OH)2 dissociates into \( \text{Ba}^{2+} \) and \( 2 \, \text{OH}^- \).  
   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH- = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Neutralization of H+ from HCl with OH-**:  
   OH- reacts with H+ from HCl in a 1:1 ratio.  
   Remaining OH- after neutralizing HCl = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Neutralization of CH3COOH with remaining OH-**:  
   CH3COOH is a weak acid, but OH- will deprotonate it:  
   \( \text{CH3COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH3COO}^- + \text{H2O} \).  
   Moles of CH3COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Remaining OH- after neutralizing CH3COOH = \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Calculate concentration of OH-**:  
   Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   Concentration of OH- = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M} \).

6. **Calculate pH**:  
   pOH = \( -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \).  
   pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
