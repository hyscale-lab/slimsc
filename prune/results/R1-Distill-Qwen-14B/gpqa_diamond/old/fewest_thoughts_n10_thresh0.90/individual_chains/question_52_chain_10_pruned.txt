Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read the question again and try to understand what it's asking.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the star isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The problem then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They ask by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So, I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, so if the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that means when the temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when the star is hotter (6000 K). So, the factor by which it changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me think. The ratio is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). Let's denote delta E = E2 - E1. So the ratio is proportional to exp( -delta_E/(kT) ), because (E2-E1) would be positive if E2 is higher than E1.

Wait, no, wait: The formula is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, making the exponential positive. So higher temperature would make the exponential term bigger, which would make n1/n2 larger if E2>E1.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So for higher T, the ratio is higher. So, in spot case (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower than when T is 6000 K.

So the factor is (ratio at 6000 K) / (ratio at 5500 K) = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ].

Simplify that: exp( (E2-E1) [ 1/(k*6000) - 1/(k*5500) ] ) = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Wait, but do I know E2-E1? Probably not directly, but I can relate it to the wavelength. Since the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is about 1448 Angstroms. Using the relation E = hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

Right, so delta E = hc / lambda.

So, let's compute delta E/(k) first, because that's what's in the exponent.

But wait, the exact values: Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s, lambda is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. Then, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Calculating delta E/(k):

delta E = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)
= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1448e-10 m)
= 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Then delta E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 1e5 (approx 99500 ≈ 1e5). So about 1e5 K.

Wait, wait, that's because delta E/(k) has units of K (since J/(J/K) = K). So it's about 1e5 K.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 299792458 m/s
lambda = 1448e-10 m.

So delta E = h*c / lambda = (6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8) / (1.448e-7 m)

Calculating numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 1.9864e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m.

So delta E = 1.9864e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Then, delta E / k = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.380649e-23 J/K) ≈
