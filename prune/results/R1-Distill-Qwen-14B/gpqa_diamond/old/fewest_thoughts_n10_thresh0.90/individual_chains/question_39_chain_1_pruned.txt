Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle.

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but wait. I remember that for a wave function to be physically valid, it needs to satisfy a few conditions. One of them is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, in this case, the wave function is given in a part of space where the particle exists between x=1 and x=3. Because when they measured, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region, I guess. So the integration should be from x=1 to x=3.

Wait, but the wave function provided is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. Oh wait, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake. Because typically, a wave function shouldn't have an imaginary component if we're considering position probabilities. Or maybe it's just given that way. Well, the absolute square of a complex number is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2, right?

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square would be |ψ|²
