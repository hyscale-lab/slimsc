Alright, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some mutation in a gene that's causing an anti-nutritional compound. The question is asking which mutation would eliminate the compound. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

So, the intact gene has a specific sequence. Then there are four mutants, each with a different change. The first thing I'm thinking is that the anti-nutritional compound is likely being caused by the gene's function. So, if we can disrupt this gene's function, maybe the compound won't be made anymore, making the barley usable.

Looking at the sequences, each mutant has a change somewhere in the first exon. Exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutation here could affect the protein it produces. But wait, not all changes are equally disruptive. Some might be silent (no change in amino acid), others might be missense (different amino acid), and some could cause a frameshift or a premature stop codon.

The goal is to find the mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Let's look at each option:

The original gene sequence in the first exon area is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the original, I see that in the original, the sequence is TTTCTCGCTGGT... In Mutant 1, it's TTCTACGCTGGT. So, looking at the exact bases, I think the change is in position 4 or so. Maybe a substitution? Let me count the letters. Hmm, maybe I should write it out.

Original exon segment: T T C T C G C T G G T A...
Mutant 1:           T T C T A C G C T G G T A...

Wait, so the fourth base is C in original, but in Mutant 1, perhaps it's A? Or maybe there's a substitution in the codons. Let's break it into codons. Let's see:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: TTCTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT... wait, maybe I should look for where the change is. Let me count each triplet.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT CAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the change is in a way that affects the reading frame? Or perhaps it's a substitution that changes an amino acid but doesn't disrupt the rest.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Here, the sequence around there is TCTAAGCT. Let me see the original. Original was TTTCTCGCTGGTACT. So in Mutant 2, maybe the sequence is changed to TCTAAGCT. Wait, the original is T T C T C G C T G G T A C T... So in Mutant 2, perhaps it's TCTAAGCT. Hmm, maybe a substitution that leads to a stop codon or a frameshift?

Wait, maybe it's better to check each mutant's specific change.

Let me compare each mutant step by step.

Intact:
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... etc.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CT CAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, looking at the first part:

Original:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CT CAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 1's first few codons are TTT CT CAG CTT GGT ACT...

Wait, perhaps the exact change is that instead of CTCGCTGGT, it's CTCAGCTGGT? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about each mutation's effect.

Mutant 1: Let's look at each codon.

Original exons: Let's split into triplets.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT CAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So in the original, the third codon is CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly)... In Mutant 1, the third codon is now CT (second codon is TTT, third is CT?), wait, maybe I'm not looking correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the exact positions. Let me write each exon part:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA… 3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTT CT CAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA… 3’

So, the original has TTT CTC GCT GGT...

Mutant 1 has TTT CT CAG CTT GGT...

Wait, so the third codon in the original is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant 1, it's changed to CT CAG, so perhaps the third codon is now CAG (Gln), but maybe a frameshift? Or perhaps it's a substitution in the third codon.

Wait, perhaps it's the fourth codon that's changed. Let me number the letters.

Original: Position 1-3: ATG; 4-6: TTT; 7-9: CTC; 10-12: GCT; 13-15: GGT; etc.

Mutant 1: 1-3: ATG; 4-6: TTT; 7-9: CTG? Wait, no, let me see.

Wait, perhaps the change is at the 7-9 position in the original (CTC) becomes CT CAG?

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which mutation leads to a frameshift or a premature stop codon.

Wait, another approach: the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. That likely requires the gene product (the compound) to not be made. So, a nonfunctional gene would do that.

Which mutations would render the gene nonfunctional? Either a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon, or a missense that completely disrupts the enzyme's function.

Looking at the options:

Mutant 1: The change is perhaps a substitution in the third codon, changing from CTC to CTC (same as original?), no, wait. Wait, the original is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Hmm, perhaps the change is in the fourth position, where CG becomes AG. Wait, the original has CG in some position. So in the original, the sequence at that point is GCT (Ala), perhaps, and in Mutant 1, it's AGC (Ser) or something else. So, a substitution that changes the amino acid.

But that's a missense mutation, which might not necessarily disrupt the protein, unless it's in a critical region.

Mutant 2:

Original exon area is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant 2's area is TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Wait, so the sequence changes from, say, CGCTGG to AAGCT. So, that would mean a change in the codons. Let me see:

In the original, the codon after TTT is CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly). In Mutant 2, perhaps the sequence after TTT becomes CTAAAGCT.

Wait, perhaps it's better to see the exact change.

Original: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 2: ...TTT CT CAA GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, the third codon is now CAA (Gln) instead of CTC (Leu). Then the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) in original, and in Mutant 2, it's GCT as well? Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's look for indels (insertions or deletions) that cause frameshifts, which would disrupt the reading frame and cause a premature stop codon.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: The sequence seems to have a substitution from C to A in the same position, perhaps, so no frameshift.

Mutant 2: Hmm, let's see. The original has ...CTCGCTGGT..., Mutant 2 has ...CTAAGCTGGT...

Wait, so in the original, maybe the sequence is CTC GCT GGT ACT. In mutant 2, it's CTA AGC TGG TAC. So, perhaps the mutation introduced an extra base or an insertion/deletion? Wait, no, the length of the sequences may be the same. So perhaps it's a substitution, not a frameshift.

Mutant 3:

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant 3: ...CTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGT...

Wait, so in the original, the sequence after CT is CGCTGGTACT. In mutant 3, it's AC GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Hmm, so there's a change in the codon sequence. For example, the original might have had CGC TGG TAC, which is CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr). In mutant 3, perhaps it's CTACGCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is shifted. Let me look again.

Original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 3: ...CTA CGC TGG TGT CAC T...

Hmm, perhaps the change causes a frameshift. Wait, let me count the number of letters. The original and mutant sequences in the question should be the same length, as EMS mutagenesis typically causes point mutations, not indels. Oh wait, EMS is a point mutagen, usually leading to substitutions, not insertions or deletions. So all the mutants probably have substitutions, not indels. So no frameshifts, which would require insertions or deletions of bases that aren't multiples of three.

So that leaves us with substitution mutations. Now, which substitution would cause a nonfunctional protein?

Perhaps if a substitution introduces a stop codon early in the sequence. Let's check each mutant for the presence of a stop codon.

The stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA.

Looking at each mutant's sequence:

Mutant 1:

...TACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

In the original, the sequence after some point is ...GTCGT…TGA-3’. TGA is a stop codon, so that's the end.

In Mutant1, the sequence ends with ...TGC…TGA-3’. So it's the same as original. So no new stop codon introduced.

Mutant2: Ends with ...TGC...TGA. Same as original. No stop introduced.

Mutant3: Ends with ...TGT... TGA. Same as original.

Mutant4: Ends with ...TGT... TGA. Wait, let me see. Original ends with TGC...TGA.

Mutant4: The original exon area is ...GTCGT..., in Mutant4 it's ...GTCGT...? Or wait, looking at the question, Mutant4's sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So the last part is ...TGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Hmm, let me see:

In Mutant4, the sequence after some point is ...ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA. So, looking for stop codons.

Wait, the TGA is at the end, which is the normal stop codon. So no new stop introduced there.

Wait, maybe the mutation introduced a stop earlier. Let's look.

Looking at each mutant's sequence for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end.

For example, Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the part after TTCTGTGGAT is GAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, in the middle, is there a TGA? Let me see:

After CTTCTGTGGAT, the next is GAACAT...

So, the sequence is TGGATGAACATAT...

Wait, TGG is Trp, ATG is Met. So, in the middle, is there a TGA? Let me see: ATG is the start, then TGGATGAA... So no TGA within the coding sequence except at the end.

Hmm, perhaps not. So that approach may not be working. Maybe another way: if the mutation introduces a stop codon earlier, then the protein would be truncated, possibly making it nonfunctional.

Looking at Mutant2:

Sequence in the area: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Looking for TGA: CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT...

No TGA there. So perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about each mutation's effect on the protein.

Mutant1: The first few codons change from TTT CTC GCT to TTT CT CAG CTT. So, the third codon becomes CAG (Gln), and the fourth is CTT (Leu). So, amino acids change from Leu (CTC) to Gln (CAG), and then from Ala (GCT) to Leu (CTT). So, substitution of two amino acids.

But would that disrupt the protein function? Maybe, but not necessarily.

Mutant2: Changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to CAA (Gln), and perhaps another change. So again, substitution.

Mutant3: Let's look. The original had CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3's sequence is CTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, in the original, the third codon is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant3, it's CTA CGC (Arg). Hmm, wait, perhaps the codon changes from CTC (Leu) to CGC (Arg), then GCT (Ala) to GTC (Val), and so on. So multiple amino acid changes.

But again, unless it's a critical region, maybe that's not enough.

Mutant4: The sequence is CTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT.

Wait, so the third codon is CTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), then TAC (Tyr), etc. Wait, the original had CTC GCT GGT ACT... So, in Mutant4, it's CTACGCTAC TTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps the original was CTC GCT GGT ACT, and in Mutant4, it's CTACGCTAC TTCTGTGGAT...

So, the first codon (CTC -> CTA?), which is Leu, then GCT becomes GCT (Ala), but then the third codon is GGT (Gly) in original, and in Mutant4, perhaps it's TAC (Tyr) or something else.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck trying to look for stop codons. Maybe another approach: which mutation deletes a part of the gene, such as causing a frameshift leading to a premature stop? Or perhaps a nonsense mutation.

Wait, but since EMS causes point mutations, not indels, so no frameshifts. So, all mutations are point mutations.

Which point mutation changes an amino acid in a critical way, or introduces a stop codon.

Looking back, perhaps any of the mutations that introduce a stop codon in frame would cause a truncated protein.

Wait, looking again:

In Mutant4, is there any TGA before the end?
