Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's going on here. Hmm, the question is about the wave function of a particle. Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, I need to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding the particle. Oh right, the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So, the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So that's like a complex number. Let me write that down: ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. So the real part is a over sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

To find the probability density, I need to compute |ψ|², which is [ψ*][ψ], where * is the complex conjugate. So, the complex conjugate of ψ would be [a / sqrt(1+x)] + 0.5i. Multiplying these together:

ψ* ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 + i [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5) - (0.5)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When you multiply two complex numbers, (a+ib)(a-ib) = a² + b². Oh, right, because the cross terms cancel out. Because (a+ib)(a-ib) = a² - (ib)^2 = a² + b².

So in this case, ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, and ψ* is (a/sqrt(1+x)) plus 0.5i. So when I multiply them together, it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Because the cross terms (the i terms) will cancel out since they are positive and negative.

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but
