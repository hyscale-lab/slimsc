Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the non-Gaussianity, often denoted as nG, is a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. Since Gaussian states are those that can be described by a Gaussian distribution (like coherent states, squeezed states, etc.), non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described that way. The problem uses relative entropy as the measure, which I think involves comparing the given state's density matrix to a reference Gaussian state.

The state given is |ψ> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, I recall that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian states, so when you have a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases (like alpha and negative alpha), you get a non-Gaussian state, like a Schrödinger cat state.

Phi is given as -pi/4, so let me plug that in. Phi is the phase angle in the coefficients. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). Let's calculate N first.

Wait, sin(2*phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2*phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Let me compute the exponent: 0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So the term inside sqrt is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) which is about 0.627.

So the state |ψ> is normalized as (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/0.627. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So |ψ> becomes [0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071|−0.5> ] / 0.627.

Now, the relative entropy non-Gaussianity measure is given by del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but what's the reference Gaussian state here? The question says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure which Gaussian state is being used as the reference. Because the Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, maybe the reference is the completely mixed state or another Gaussian state, perhaps a coherent state itself or a thermal state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that the non-Gaussian state would reduce to if it were Gaussian. Or maybe it's the state that, when you take the partial trace or something, becomes Gaussian. Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps I can think of it as the state that has the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. But I might not need to know the exact form of tau, maybe I can proceed with some other approach.

Wait, another thought: the relative entropy is a measure of how different two states are. The del_b would be positive if rho is more non-Gaussian than tau because the entropy of rho would be higher. But in this problem, we're using a Gaussian state as a reference, so if the state is non-Gaussian, del_b would be positive, and if it's Gaussian, it would be zero.

Wait, the question is to calculate the non-Gaussianity for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. Let me think about whether this particular state is Gaussian or not. Because it's a superposition of two coherent states, it's definitely a non-Gaussian state. So the del_b should be non-zero.

But wait, sometimes if a state is a coherent state, it's Gaussian, so maybe the reference state tau is a coherent state. Alternatively, could it be another Gaussian state, like a squeezed state or a thermal state?

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state with the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. For example, the density matrix of the reference state tau would have the same mean photon number and the same variance as rho. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively
