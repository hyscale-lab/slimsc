Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction where a sigma bond moves, along with a pi bond. I think Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of these. 

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each starting with a different reactant and conditions. I need to figure out what each product is from the options given.

Let's take them one by one.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A.

Hmm. So, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure would be something like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Wait, more accurately, the amine is on the same carbon as two methoxy groups. So the structure is (OCH3)2CH-NH2, right? Because ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as NH2. So it's (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2.

But wait, no. Ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 on the same carbon as the amine. So it's CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2. So the structure is (OCH3)2CH2NH2? No, wait, the ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2, but the substituents are on the first carbon. So the structure is (OCH3)2CHNH2. Wait, maybe it's (OCH3)2CH2NH2. Maybe I should draw it: the amine is on carbon 1, which has two methoxy groups attached. So the carbon is connected to NH2, two OCH3 groups, and another CH2 group? Wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but the first carbon (the one attached to NH2) has two methoxy groups. So it's (OCH3)2CH2NH2? Or is it (OCH3)2CHCH2NH2? Wait no, ethanamine is two carbons, with NH2 on the first. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OCH3 on the first carbon. So the structure is (OCH3)2CH2NH2? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2. I'm a bit confused, but I think it's (OCH3)2CH2NH2, but maybe I'm mixing this up.

The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure is CH2CH2CHOHCH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, but-3-en-2-ol
