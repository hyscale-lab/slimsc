Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width (full width at half maximum) is proportional to 1/τ1, and similarly for state 2.

So the two lines (from E1 and E2) must be spaced apart by more than the sum of their line widths to be distinguishable. Because if they're too close, their spectral lines might overlap and you can't tell them apart.

So the minimal energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of the line widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2) for the two states.

Alternatively, I've heard that the energy resolution is such that the two energies must be separated by more than the uncertainty of measurement. So if the measurement has an uncertainty of ΔE1 for E1 and ΔE2 for E2, then the energy difference must be larger than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to be resolved.

Wait, but another thought: when you measure E1 and E2, the uncertainty in each energy is about ħ/(2τ). So the energy difference E2-E1 must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties to be distinguishable. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute the values. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.055e-34 J·s.

Convert ħ to eV·s because the options are in eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 J = 6.242e18 eV.

So ħ in eV·s is (1.055e-34 J·s) * (6.242e18 eV/J) = approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Wait, that seems familiar. I think ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) ) = (6.582/2) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Because 1e-9 s is 1 nanosecond. So 6.582e-16 / (2e-9) is 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582/2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly for state 2: τ2 = 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = (6.582/2) * 1e-8 eV = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, τ2 is bigger than τ1, so the uncertainty ΔE should be smaller, which matches because ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV, which is indeed smaller than ΔE1.

So the sum of the uncertainties would be 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV (since 3.29e-7 is 32.9e-8, plus 3.29 is 36.19e-8, which is 3.619e-7).

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the required ΔE must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be distinguishable.

So the minimal ΔE would be on the order of 3.6e-7 eV. So any energy difference larger than that would allow them to be resolved.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → that's 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 3.6e-7. So too small.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → much smaller, no.

Option C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → that's way bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that would work.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → which is about 1e-8. But 3.6e-7 is about 36e-8. So 1e-8 is much smaller, so D is too small.

So the only option that is larger than the sum of the uncertainties is option C (1e-4 eV) and option... wait, are there any others? Let's see. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

So the correct answer must be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. I think I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me re-calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE = ħ/(2 τ)

So for τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-
