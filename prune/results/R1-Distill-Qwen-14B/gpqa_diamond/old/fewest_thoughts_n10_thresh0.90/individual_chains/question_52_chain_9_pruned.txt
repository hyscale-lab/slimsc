Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question is about a star whose properties change when it has spots. When the star doesn't have spots, its Teff (effective temperature) is 6000K, and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. Wait, but wait, how does that work? Oh right, because the spots are cooler, so they make the overall star appear cooler when observed from a distance.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

So, the ratio in question is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2, respectively. I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. So, the ratio n1/n2 is lower when T is lower.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). Because the formula is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So when temperature T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller because the denominator is smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would go down when T goes down.

Wait, because if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T is higher, the exponent is more negative, making the exponential term smaller. Wait no, because T is in the denominator. Let me correct that.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So when T is higher, the denominator is larger, so the exponent becomes a smaller negative number. So exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller. So higher T would mean the exponent is a smaller negative, so the overall value is larger. So for example, if T increases, n1/n2 increases because the exponential term is larger.

But in this problem, when the star has spots, the Teff drops to 5500K, so T becomes lower. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if T decreases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease when T decreases.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when T is 6000K. So that makes sense with the Boltzmann equation.

But the question is, by what factor does the ratio change when the star is spotless (T=6000K) compared to when it has spots (T=5500K). So we're looking for (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Wait, no, the question says, 'the ratio decreases when the star has spots.' So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor by which the ratio changes is when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 divided by (n1/n2)_5500. Because if (n1/n2)_6000 is bigger than (n1/n2)_5500, then the ratio when unspotted is bigger than when spotted. So this factor would be greater than 1.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor is (unspotted ratio) / (spotted ratio) = (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500. So that would be >1.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ) ]

Wait, but the g terms would cancel out, right? Because (g1/g2) is the same in both, because the energy levels are the same in the two cases. So the factor simplifies to exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) + (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ] )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k)
