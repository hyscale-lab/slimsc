Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by the formula derived from the crystal's lattice parameters. Oh wait, right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )... wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's a different form. Oh wait, I think the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with a rhombohedral structure is a bit specific because all the angles are the same. 

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where a = b = c, and all angles α, β, γ are equal. Oh right, so in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. So the formula might simplify because of that symmetry.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = (a)/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )) ). Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the angles. Because in the Miller indices, h, k, l correspond to the intercepts along a, b, c axes. But in the formula, the cos terms would be for the angles between the axes. So in a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is α, between a and c is β, and between b and c is γ. But in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so α = β = γ = 30°. So the formula can be simplified since all angles are the same.

So substituting the (111) plane indices, which are h=1, k=1, l=1. So let's plug into the formula.

So first, compute the numerator and denominator. The numerator is a, which is given as 10 Angstrom. The denominator is the square root of [ (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2*(1*1 * cos γ) + 2*(1*1 * cos β) + 2*(1*1 * cos α) ) ].

Wait, but wait, because in rhombohedral, the formula might have a different form. Wait, another thought: Alternatively, the formula for d is a divided by sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ) ). But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so cos α = cos β = cos γ = cos 30°, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, the denominator becomes sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) + 2*(1)(1) * cos 30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30).

Wait, let's calculate the denominator step by step.

Sum of squares: 1 +1 +1 =3.

The cross terms: 2*(hk cos α) = 2*(1)(1)*cos30, and same for the other terms since h=k=l=1 and all angles are the same. So there are three cross terms, each contributing 2*1*1*cos30. So 3 * (2 * cos30) = 6 * cos30.

So the denominator is sqrt( 3 + 6 * cos30° ).

Let me compute that. Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 +5.196 =8.196.

Then sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863 = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491 Angstrom? Wait, that can't be right. Because the options are all around 9 Angstrom, like 9.08, 8.95, etc. That's way smaller than the interatomic distance. Did I mess up the formula?

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Another possibility is that the formula for d is a/(sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) )) ). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in a cubic system,
