Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition, specifically 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. We're asked to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying the operator, and then the state again. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

So the given state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me note that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are orthonormal, which I think is important.

The operator in question is 10σz +5σx. I can probably break this into two parts: compute the expectation of 10σz and 5σx separately, then add them.

Let me first compute each part.

Starting with 10σz. Since σz is diagonal in the basis |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, its matrix representation is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, σz |↑⟩ = |↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

The expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩. Let's compute this.

⟨ψ| is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) because |↑⟩ is the first basis vector and |↓⟩ is the second. So when I take the conjugate transpose, since the coefficients are real, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩. Let me compute this:

σz |ψ⟩ = σz (0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩) = 0.5 σz|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σz|↓⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)(-|↓⟩).

So, σz |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ - (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

Then, when I take ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩, it's the inner product of (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) with (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, no, actually, the inner product is (0.5)(0.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)(-sqrt(3)/2). Let me calculate that.

0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
sqrt(3)/2 * (-sqrt(3)/2) = (-3)/4 = -0.75.

Adding them: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. Then, 10⟨σz⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Wait, wait, no: no, the operator is 10σz, so the expectation is 10 times the expectation of σz. So that's 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to σx. σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So it swaps the basis states.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me compute σx|ψ⟩. Since σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σx |↓⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) · (sqrt(3)/2, 0.5). Because σx |ψ⟩ is written as (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩ + 0.5 |↓⟩.

Wait, no: the σx |ψ⟩ is 0.5 |↓⟩ plus (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩. So when written as a vector, it's (sqrt(3)/2, 0.5), because |↑⟩ is the first component.

So ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Let
