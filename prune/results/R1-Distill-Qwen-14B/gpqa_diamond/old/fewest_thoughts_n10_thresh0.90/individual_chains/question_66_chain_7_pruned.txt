Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT for short. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to pick which combination of these is correct.

Hmm, let me remember. I think SMEFT is a framework where you write physics beyond the Standard Model as a series of higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect certain symmetries, probably the same ones as the Standard Model.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Oh right! Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if Lorentz symmetry is a part of Poincare, then any theory that respects Poincare also respects Lorentz. But does SMEFT require Poincare or just Lorentz?

I recall that the Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry. So do SMEFT operators. Because when you expand SMEFT, you're adding terms that don't break the SM symmetries, so they should also maintain Poincare. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are required.

What about CP and CPT? CP symmetry is about the combination of charge conjugation and parity. CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. I think the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, but it does have CPT symmetry. Oh wait, wait, isn't CPT symmetry a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory? Because of the spin-statistics theorem and other things, I think all QFTs respect CPT symmetry. So regardless of the model, if it's a valid QFT, it must respect CPT.

So the operators in SMEFT must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct. But what about CP? The Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, so SMEFT operators can violate CP. But the question is which symmetries must be respected. So CP isn't necessarily respected; it's not a must. So 3 is not a required symmetry.

Putting it together. The operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but question says which must be respected by all operators. Wait, can Poincare be broken? Because Poincare includes translations, so if the theory has a preferred frame, that would break Poincare. But SMEFT is an effective theory, which is supposed to work in any frame, right? So it should respect Poincare.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. Let me check the options. Option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. So the correct choice should be C.

Wait, but I should double-check. Does SMEFT respect CPT? Since the SM does, and SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory of the SM, yes. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT. Therefore, option C would be correct.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework where physics beyond the Standard Model is encoded as higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect
