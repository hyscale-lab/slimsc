Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian is given as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, mass dimension calculations. Right, in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the Lagrangian density has dimensions of mass^4 (since the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over d^4x, which has dimension mass^-4). So each term in the Lagrangian must have [L] = mass^4.

So let me look at the term here: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I should find the dimensions of each component. Let me recall the dimensions of the fields. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (∂/ - i m)ψ = 0, and the action must be dimensionless. Let's see, the derivative ∂ has dimension 1 (mass dimension 1), so each ψ must have dimension 3/2? Wait, let me think again.

The Lagrangian density has dimension 4. The kinetic term for ψ is something like ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. So each ψ has dimension 3/2 because the term is [ψ̄][i γ][∂][ψ] = (3/2) + (1) + (1) + (3/2) = 4. Wait, wait, [ψ] is 3/2, [∂] is 1, and ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ. So yeah, that sums up to 3/2 * 2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the term is [ψ̄] [γ] [∂μ] [ψ], so [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, [∂] is 1. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 4. Oh right, because the gamma matrices are dimensionless. So yeah, each ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. So it's made of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is a tensor made of gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism. The field tensor F is defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each A_mu is a vector field, and has dimension 1, because the Maxwell Lagrangian is (1/4) F^2, which should have dimension 4. Since F^2 would be (F)^2 where F has dimension 2 (because F has [∂ A] and [A] is 1; so [F]=1+1=2). Wait, let me think again. F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each term is derivative (dimension 1) times A (dimension 1). So F has dimension 2. Then F^2 would be [F]^2 = 4. But the Maxwell term is (1/4) F^2, so [F^2]=4, which matches the Lagrangian dimension of 4. So [F_{mu nu}] is 2.

Wait, but in this term, the F is F^{mu nu}, which is the same as F^{mu nu} which in the Maxwell term is F_{mu nu} but with indices raised, so it doesn't change the dimension. So [F^{mu nu}] is 2.

So putting it all together in the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each ψ̄ and ψ is 3/2 each. σ is dimensionless. F is 2.

So the term's dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2.

Wait, wait, let me compute that. [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, [F] is 2. So adding those: 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the term's dimension is [κ] +5. But since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] =4-5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would point towards options A or C.

Now, for renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant's dimension is non-negative. Wait, no, wait: Let me think. The mass dimension of the coupling κ is negative in this case. Because [κ] is -1.

Wait, in general, for a term in the Lagrangian of the form g φ^n, the dimension of g is [g] = 4 - n [φ]. If the dimension is positive, the coupling is relevant and the theory is renormalizable. If [g] is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable since you can't have a finite number of terms in perturbation theory.

Wait, but wait. The coupling's dimension being negative implies it's of higher dimension, so the interaction becomes irrelevant at high energies, hence the theory is non-renormalizable. Because in a renormalizable theory, the coupling has dimension less than or equal to 4 - n (where n is the number of fields in the term) so that it can have a finite number of terms. Alternatively, the term must have positive or zero dimension for the theory to be renormalizable.

Wait, I think another way to think about it: For a term in the Lagrangian, if the dimension of the coupling plus the sum of the fields' dimensions is less than 4, it's irrelevant. Wait, no, no. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So each term must have [g] + sum [φ] =4. So if [g] is negative, then the sum of [φ] must be more than 4. But for renormalizability, all couplings must have mass dimension ≥0 in 4 dimensions. Because if [g] is negative, the term is of higher dimension and thus the theory is non-renormalizable.

In this case, [κ] is -1. So the term is of dimension 4, but in terms of renormalizability: the coupling has negative dimension, which implies the theory is non-renormalizable.

So the options: looking back, if [κ] is -1 and the theory is non-renormalizable, that's option C.

So the correct answer would be C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have a total mass dimension of 4. Breaking down the dimensions of each term:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, so $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$, the field strength tensor, has a mass dimension of $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$ (derived from the Maxwell Lagrangian).

The total dimension of the term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}].
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have a total dimension of 4:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension and the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
