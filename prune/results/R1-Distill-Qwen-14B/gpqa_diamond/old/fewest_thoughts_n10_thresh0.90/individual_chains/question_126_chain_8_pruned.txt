Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two reactions performed by a chemist. Then, after combining the products, they run them on two different HPLC columns—normal-phase and chiral. The question is about how many peaks they observe in each chromatogram.

Let me start by breaking down the problem. First, I'll look at each reaction separately to figure out what products are formed.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone—specifically, a 6-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5.

Wait, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one structure: Hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂CO(CH₂)₂CH3. But with a methoxy group at C5. So the structure is CH₂CH₂-CO-CH2-OCH3?

Wait, let me write it properly. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But since it's 5-methoxy, the substituent is on the fifth carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2(OCH3) somewhere. Let me think. Hexan-3-one is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO, then the rest. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Let me correct: 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would have the carbonyl at position 3, and the methoxy at position 5.

So the structure is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3. Wait, that can't be right because the chain would be longer. Let me count the carbons. Hexan means six carbons. So positions 1 to 6. The ketone is at position 3, so the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, that doesn't add up. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO, then in a six-carbon chain, the ketone is at position 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's too long. Wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2-OCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as:

The formula for hexan-3-one is CH₂CH₂CO(CH₂)₂CH3. But with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So carbon 5 is the fourth from the ketone. So, perhaps the structure is (S)-5-meth
