Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait. Oh right, the wave function is usually a complex number, so this makes sense—there's a real part and an imaginary part. But when measuring position, the imaginary part doesn't matter because the probability is based on the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

When they measure the position, they only find particles between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Hmm, but wait, the wave function given here is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps there's more to the wave function. Maybe it's only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Oh, but the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't look like it's zero anywhere except maybe when the real part is zero.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The wave function given is ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function is a combination of a real function and a constant imaginary part.

But for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of the probability density must be finite. The probability density is |ψ(x)|², which is [a²/(1+x) ] + 0.25, because (real part squared) plus (imaginary part squared). Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly. The absolute square of ψ is (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i) multiplied by its complex conjugate (a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i) gives (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that's the probability density. But if the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, then the probability density should be zero outside that interval. That suggests that the wave function itself must be zero outside x=1 and x=3.

But looking at the given wave function, (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, when does that equal zero? For ψ=0, both real and imaginary parts must be zero. So a/(sqrt(1+x)) = 0 and 0.5 = 0. But 0.5 isn't zero, so that's impossible. So that can't be right. So perhaps the given wave function isn't the entire story. Maybe it's only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the problem states that particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this range. So the actual wave function is a piecewise function: ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, no—because the given wave function doesn't have any zero regions. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is constant. But if this is the case, then the wave function isn't zero outside x=1 and x=3. So how do we reconcile that with the fact that particles were only found between 1 and 3?

Ah, wait a minute. The wave function must be zero outside of x=1 and x=3 for the particles to only be found there. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But in the given expression, it's not zero outside. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But then how does that relate to the given expression?

Wait, perhaps I need to find a such that the wave function is zero beyond x=1 and x=3. But looking at the given expression, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), which would be zero only if a is zero, but that can't be right because a is a constant we're supposed to find. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, another approach. The wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. So the given wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. So perhaps the expression (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i is in that interval and zero elsewhere. But then, in that case, the function is non-zero between 1 and 3 and zero outside. So the wave function is a piecewise function.

But then, how to find a? Well, for a normalized wave function, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So let's compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3.

Given ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in that interval. So |ψ(x)|² is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Since the wave function is zero elsewhere, the integral is from 1 to 3.

Let's compute that integral:

∫ [a²/(1+x) ] dx from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Since the integral must equal 1 for normalization, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): about 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Let me get more precise.

Wait, 0.7213. Square root of 0.7213: let's see. 0.85 squared is 0.7225. Oh wait, that's very close to 0.7213. So a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) for \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), and it is zero outside this interval. The probability density is \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \).

Since the wave function is normalized, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2) \).
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5 \).

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.

**Answer: B**
