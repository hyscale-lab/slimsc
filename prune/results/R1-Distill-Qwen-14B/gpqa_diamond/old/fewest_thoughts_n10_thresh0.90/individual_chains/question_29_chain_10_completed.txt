Okay, I've got this question about genetics and mutations. Let me read it carefully to understand what's being asked.

So, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible for its synthesis. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the target gene in all mutants.

The question is asking which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The options are Mutant 1 to 4, and the choices are A to D.

Looking at the intact gene and the mutants, I need to figure out which mutation disrupts the gene's function. Probably, a nonsense mutation or a frameshift would cause a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein which might not function, thus eliminating the compound.

Let's look at each mutant's sequence.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3'.

Each mutant has changes in the beginning of the first exon.

Let's compare each mutant one by one.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene:
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, let's look at the third codon. The original is TTT (which is Phe), mutant 1 has TCT? Wait, wait, perhaps looking at the exact change.

Wait, the original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Looking at the beginning:

Original: The first few bases are ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So, the first codons are:

Original: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu)...

Mutant 1: ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu)... 

Wait, so in Mutant1, the second codon is TTC (Phe), same as original. The third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So that's a point mutation in the third codon.

So, it's a substitution of Leu to Tyr. That's an amino acid change but not a frameshift or stop codon. So the protein would still be made, but with a different amino acid. Maybe that doesn't eliminate the compound.

Mutant2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compare with original:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

So, the first two codons are same (ATG, TTC). Third codon is TAA. Let's see: TAA is a stop codon (amber stop). Oh, wait! That's a big deal. So in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. That would cause the protein to terminate early, leading to a nonfunctional or shorter protein. So the gene product might not be made, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The original's third codon is CTC (Leu), so if in Mutant2, it's TAA, which is a stop at the third codon. So the mRNA would have a stop at that point. So the protein would be much shorter—only the first two amino acids (start and Phe) and then stop. So the rest of the protein isn't made.

That would probably disrupt the gene's function. So this might be a candidate.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Compare:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the first two codons are same: ATG (start), TTT (Phe). Third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Fourth codon: GCT same. Fifth codon GGT same. Then, sixth codon: GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So another substitution. So this is a point mutation in two places. Maybe causing an amino acid change but not a stop. So the protein would still be made, perhaps with altered function, but not necessarily eliminated.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Compare:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, let's break it down. First codon ATG. Second TTT Phe. Third codon: TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Fourth codon: GCT same. Fifth codon: ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, substitution of Gly to Thr. So again, point mutations, but no stop codons. So the protein would be altered but not terminated.

So which option is the best? We're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene, probably leading to a nonfunctional protein. This could be a nonsense mutation (stop codon) or a frameshift (changes all downstream codons), but looking at the sequences, the length seems same, so no frameshift. Only point mutations.

So in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So that’s a nonsense mutation. This would lead to a truncated protein. If the gene product requires the full length to function, this would eliminate the compound.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A is Mutant2.

Are there other possibilities? Let me double-check.

Mutant4: The sequence is shorter. The original is longer. Let me count the letters.

Wait, looking again:

Intact gene: ...ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3’
Mutant4: ...ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3’

Wait, the intact gene has "CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT..." which is 15 nucleotides (5 codons). Mutant4 has "TACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT..." So the first part: original is CTCGCTGGTACT, which is 15 nt (5 codons). Mutant4 has TACGCTACTTCT, which is 12 nt (4 codons). Wait, because the original's first part is 30 nt (10 codons? Let me recount...).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 has a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift.

Wait, let me check. The original first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

Mutant4's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

So:

Original codons 3: CTC (Leu)
Codon 4: GCT (Ala)
Codon5: GGT (Gly)
Codon6: ACT (Thr)
Mutant4: codon3: TAC (Tyr), codon4: GCT (Ala), codon5: ACT (Thr), etc.

Wait, so codon5 in the original was GGT, which is Gly. In Mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So that's a point mutation at codon5. So no frameshift, same number of codons. So the rest of the sequence is the same, just a substitution. So the protein would have a substitution at that position, but no truncation. So gene would still be expressed, but with a different amino acid.

So back to the options. The only mutation that introduces a stop codon is Mutant2, which at the third codon introduces TAA, a stop. So the gene would produce a very short peptide, possibly not functional.

Therefore, the correct answer is Mutant2, which is option A.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene's function. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's ability to synthesize the compound, likely through a premature stop codon or a significant frameshift.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Mutant 1**:  
   The sequence shows a point mutation in the third codon, changing Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). This is an amino acid substitution but does not introduce a stop codon or cause a frameshift. The protein would still be produced, albeit with a slight alteration.  

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   The third codon is changed from Leu (CTC) to a stop codon (TAA). This introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein. If the gene product requires the full length to function, this mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.  

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   The sequence shows two point mutations: the third codon changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC), and the sixth codon changes from Thr (ACT) to Val (GTC). These are amino acid substitutions, but the protein would still be produced, albeit with altered amino acids.  

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   The sequence shows a point mutation in the third codon (Leu to Tyr) and another in the fifth codon (Gly to Thr). These are amino acid substitutions, and the protein would still be produced, albeit with changes. There is no evidence of a stop codon or frameshift.  

### Conclusion:
The most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) at the third codon, leading to a nonfunctional or significantly shortened protein.
