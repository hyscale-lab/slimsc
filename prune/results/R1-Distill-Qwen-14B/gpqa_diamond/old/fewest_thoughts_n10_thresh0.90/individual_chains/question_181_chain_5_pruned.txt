Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to break it down. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if a process stopped in the core, we wouldn't notice the effect on the neutrinos we detect right away because neutrinos move much faster, but in this case, it's been 8.5 minutes, so maybe the neutrinos emitted before that point are still the same, but the ones produced now are affected.

Wait, no, actually, the neutrinos would have already been produced before the process stopped. Hmm. Or maybe the neutrinos are produced by the pp-III reactions, so if they stopped, the neutrino production from that source would drop. But how does that affect the flux we observe now?

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to think about how the pp-III branch contributes to these bands.

I remember that the pp chain is the main source of solar energy. The pp-III branch is probably a part of that chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos. Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-II and pp-III produce higher energy ones. Specifically, the pp-III branch emits neutrinos with higher energies, around 1-2 MeV, I think.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those high-energy neutrinos would stop. So the flux of high-energy neutrinos would drop, but the lower-energy ones from other branches would remain.

Wait, but the question is about two bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So band 1 is up to 800 keV and band 2 is from 800 up. If pp-III stopped, which branch contributes more to each band?

I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the higher energy ranges, maybe around 1.5 MeV or so. So if the pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos in higher energies would decrease. But wait, neutrinos from the pp-III branch are usually higher than 1 MeV, so band 2 (800-900 keV) is below that, right? Because 900 keV is 0.9 MeV. Oh wait, no, 900 keV is 0.9 MeV, which is less than 1 MeV. So maybe the pp-III neutrinos are around 1.5 MeV, which is higher than both bands.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The pp chain produces neutrinos in certain energy ranges. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-I produces lower energy neutrinos, say around 0.4 MeV (400 keV). The pp-II might produce a bit higher, maybe around 1 MeV, and pp-III even higher, like 1.5-2 MeV. 

So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux of the highest energy neutrinos would drop. But what about the bands given? 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. That's 0.7 to 0.8 MeV and 0.8 to 0.9 MeV.

Wait, but the pp-III neutrinos are higher than that. So if pp-III stopped, then the higher energy neutrinos would decrease, but the lower ones (from other branches) would remain. So the flux in the lower bands (like 700-800 keV) might not be affected as much, while the higher bands (like 800-900) are also lower than the pp-III range. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up which branch contributes to which energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the higher energy neutrinos. Wait, actually, the dominant neutrino emission from the Sun comes from the pp chain, specifically the pp-I branch, producing neutrinos around 0.4 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant but contribute higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, another thought: The question says that the pp-III branch has suddenly stopped. So the neutrinos from that branch would no longer be produced. So the flux in the bands where pp-III neutrinos are emitted would drop.

But the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy than both bands. So if the pp-III is stopped, the flux in higher energy bands (like above 1 MeV) would drop, but the bands in question are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So perhaps these bands are mostly from other branches, like maybe the pp-II contributes more to the lower end of the higher bands.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find out the typical neutrino energies from each branch.

From what I recall:

- The pp-I branch (the main branch) produces neutrinos around 0.4 MeV (400 keV).
- The pp-II branch produces higher, around 1.0 MeV.
- The pp-III branch produces even higher, around 1.5 MeV.

So if the pp-III branch
