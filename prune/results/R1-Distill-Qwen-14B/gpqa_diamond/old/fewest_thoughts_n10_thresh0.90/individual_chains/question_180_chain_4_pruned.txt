Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

So there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. That's twice the elementary charge, right? And they have negligible mass, which probably means I can ignore kinetic energy or anything like that and just focus on their potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so point P must be where the 13th charge is located. The other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So they form a spherical shell around P? Or maybe they're arranged in some other way, but since they're constrained at 2m distance, perhaps their exact positions don't matter beyond that.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think this involves calculating the electric potential energy between the charges, because that's the main form of energy here when the charges are arranged in space.

Wait, but how is the energy calculated here? I remember that the electric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But in a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for n charges, each pair contributes to the total. But wait, in this case, since the charges are identical and fixed at certain positions, I need to calculate all the pairwise interactions.

Let's break it down. There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. But what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Are they at the same distance from each other?

I think so. If all 12 are at 2m from P, and assuming they're arranged in a way that their mutual distances are such that each is equally distant from each other, but wait, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. It doesn't specify their mutual distances. Hmm, so maybe the mutual distances between the 12 charges are not given. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the configuration that gives the minimum energy would be when the potential energy between them is as low as possible.

Wait no, wait. The potential energy in a system of charges depends on their arrangement. If you have positive charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe their positions relative to each other can vary, but each is fixed at 2m from P. So to minimize the potential energy, how should they arrange themselves?

Wait, but wait another thing. What's the sign of the charges? Each is 2e. So e is positive, so each charge is positive. So positive charges repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, which is the sum of the potential energies of each pair, those individual potentials will be positive because q1 and q2 are positive, so U is positive. To minimize the total, we need to arrange the charges such that the potential energies between each pair are as small as possible (i.e., as low as possible, which for positive charges would be as far apart as possible).

But since all the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from P, maybe their arrangement among themselves affects their mutual distances. But the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but it doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. So perhaps for the minimum energy, the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they are as far apart as possible from each other, but constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere
