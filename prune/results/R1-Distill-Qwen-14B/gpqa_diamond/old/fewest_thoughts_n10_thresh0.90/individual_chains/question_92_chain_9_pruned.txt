Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that looks like a long chain with some double bonds. I think the structure has two double bonds because I see C=CH and another C= in the middle. So each double bond would affect the bond energies.

The question provides the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an atom into separate atoms. So for carbon, it's the energy needed to break a C-C bond? Or wait, no. Wait, enthalpy of atomization is usually the energy to break a molecule into atoms. Oh, maybe this is the bond dissociation energy for carbon in its standard state. Like, for carbon atoms in a molecule, like in graphite or something. Hmm, but in this problem, they might be considering it as the energy per carbon atom when it's fully separated. Not sure yet, but I'll get back to that.

The bond energies provided are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

The problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the given compound. Wait, enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So in this case, the standard states would be carbon (probably graphite) and hydrogen gas.

So the approach here is to use the bond energies to calculate the enthalpy change when the compound is formed from its elements. The formula I remember is:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds formed)

Wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say that when forming a molecule from its elements, you have to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) and form the bonds in the product. So the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants minus the energy released when the bonds are formed in the product.

But wait, for elements, like H2 and C, the bonds that need to be broken are the bonds in H2 and C (if it's in a molecular form, but carbon is an element in solid form, so maybe we don't need to break any bonds for C). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the enthalpy change when the compound is formed from its constituent atoms. So for each molecule, the elements are in their standard states. For carbon, the standard state is graphite, which is an atomic solid. So to form the compound, I need to take carbon atoms and H2 molecules, and combine them into the target molecule.

So the process would be:

1. Break all the bonds in the reactants (elements) to get individual atoms.
2. Use those atoms to form the bonds in the product molecule.

The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the energies required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the energies released when the bonds are formed in the product.

But wait, I'm getting confused about whether to subtract or add. Let me think again. When bonds are broken, energy is absorbed, and when bonds are formed, energy is released. So the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds formed)

But wait, in the standard formation reaction, we have:

Elements in their standard states â†’ 1 mole of compound.

So for the target compound, which is an alkene with multiple substituents, I'll need to calculate the bonds in the compound and compare them to the bonds in the elements.

Wait, but how are the elements structured? For hydrogen, it
