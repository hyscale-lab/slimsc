Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d), or plx = 1/d. Wait, but in what unit? Oh, right, in parsecs. So if distance d is in parsecs, plx in arcseconds is 1/d.

So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So they want the number of stars per unit range of distance, like maybe how many stars are there as you go from distance r to r+dr.

Wait, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5? Wait, no, because if N is proportional to 1/(1/d)^5, which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, that's the number of stars as a function of distance. But the question is asking how the number changes with distance per unit range. So I think they're asking for the number density, like the number per unit distance.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would scale. I remember that for stars, the number in a shell would depend on the volume and the density. So if the number of stars in a volume is proportional to some function, then the number per unit volume would be that function.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. So, substituting plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, that would mean the number of stars increases rapidly with distance, which seems a bit counterintuitive. Because typically, the number of stars in a volume increases with volume, which is r^3. But maybe this is a specific region where the star distribution isn't uniform. Or perhaps the question is about something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should model it with dN/dr, the rate of change of number with distance. Let me clarify.

If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/d(d) = 5 d^4. But wait, that's the rate of change of the total number with distance. But in reality, when you look at a thin shell between r and r+dr, the number of stars in that shell would be the change in N, which is dN = (dN/dr) dr. So dN = 5 d^4 dr.

So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to d^4. That's option C, which is r^4.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because number of stars in a shell is 4π r² dr multiplied by the volume density. So if the volume density is ρ, then dN = 4π r² ρ dr.

If the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, then N(r) = k d^5, where k is a constant. Then, the volume density ρ would be N(r) divided by the volume up to r. The volume up to r is (4/3)π r³, so density ρ(r) = N(r) / ( (4/3) π r³ ) ) = (k d^5) / ( (4/3) π r³ ) ).

Wait, but if N(r) is proportional to d^5, but d is r. So N(r) = k r^5. So ρ(r) = (k r^5) / ( (4/3) π r³ ) ) = (3k/(4 π)) r². So ρ(r) ∝ r².

Therefore, the number of stars per unit volume (the density) is proportional to r squared. Then, the number of stars in a thin shell dr is dN = 4π r² dr * ρ(r) = 4π r² dr * (r²) = 4π r^4 dr. So dN ∝ r^4 dr.

So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^4. So the correct option would be C, which is r^4.

Wait, but let me go back. The original statement is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So N is the total number of stars up to distance d.

Wait, but in reality, the number of stars in a sphere of radius d would be N ∝ d^5. Then, to find the number in a thin shell dr, you take the derivative.

dN = dN/dd * dr. Since N = k d^5 → dN/dd =5 k d^4. So dN = 5k d^4 dr. So per dr, the number is 5k d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance is proportional to d^4, which is r^4.

So the answer should be C) ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs (\(
