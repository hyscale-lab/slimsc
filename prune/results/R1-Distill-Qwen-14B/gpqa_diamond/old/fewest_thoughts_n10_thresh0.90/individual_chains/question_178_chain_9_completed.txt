Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about the Lagrangian of an interaction term and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by recalling some basics. The mass dimension is important because it tells us about the scaling behavior of the fields and coupling constants. The renormalizability depends on whether the interaction terms have mass dimension ≤4 in four spacetime dimensions because, in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants have positive mass dimension (if I remember correctly).

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. F is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism or another gauge theory.

Right, so each term in the Lagrangian must be dimensionless because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c =1). The Lagrangian density has units of [Mass]^4 in four dimensions because the integral over four-dimensional spacetime (which has [Mass]^-4) must give a dimensionless quantity when multiplied by the Lagrangian density.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Let me break down each part of the term.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

Let me figure out the dimensions of each component. 

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is derived from the vector potential A, which has dimension 1. The field strength F is the derivative of A, so each derivative adds one dimension. So F has dimension [A] + 1 = 1 +1 = 2. Wait, but wait: the field strength tensor is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each term is [A] [mass], so F has dimension [Mass]^1 * [A], and A is dimension 1. So F is dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Because gamma matrices are just 4x4 matrices, their dimensions are zero. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Putting it all together: the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because σ is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ is [3].

Then, F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) F has dimensions 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian L has to have dimension 4. So the entire term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4. Because L is dimension 4.

So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ F) is 5, and κ is a coupling constant. So the product κ * (5) must be 4. So κ must have dimension (4 -5) = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The Lagrangian term is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F. Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3/2 * 3/2? No, wait, no. Because ψ̄ is (3/2) and ψ is (3/2), and σ is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3. F is 2. So 3 * 2 = 6? Wait, no, no, no. Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ multiplied by F. So that's (3) * (2) = 5. So the entire term is [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1. So yes, correct, [κ] is -1.

Now, the next part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories require that the coupling constants have positive mass dimension or zero. Because couplings with negative mass dimension would lead to problems at high energies; the interaction terms become more relevant, leading to non-renormalizable theories.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥0. Because in four dimensions, the dimension of the coupling is given by [g] = 4 - (sum of field dimensions). So if the sum of the field dimensions in the interaction term is less than or equal to 4, then [g] is non-negative, making the term renormalizable.

In the interaction term here, which is L ~ κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The fields involved are ψ (twice, because ψ̄ and ψ) and F. So each ψ has 3/2, so two of them sum to 3. F has dimension 2. So sum is 3 +2 =5. So the dimension of the coupling is [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the term in the Lagrangian. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term is:

κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3. F is 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F is 3+2=5. So κ must have dimension 4-5= -1. So [κ]=-1.

So for renormalizability, the coupling constant's dimension must be ≥0. Because in four dimensions, a coupling with [g] =4 - (field dimensions), which for renormalizable theories, field dimensions sum to ≤4, making [g] ≥0.

In this case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Putting it all together: [κ]_M is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Let's look at the options.

Option A says [κ]_M is -1 and theory is renormalizable. No, because [κ] is negative.

Option B: [κ]_M=1, renormalizable. No, our calculation says -1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. Yes, that's our conclusion.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. No.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has $[F]_M = 2$, as it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$ with $[A]_M = 1$.

### Step 2: Dimension of the interaction term
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ involves $\bar{\psi}$, $\psi$, and $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$. Since $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a product of gamma matrices, it is dimensionless. Thus:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi]_M = [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
Including $F^{\mu\nu}$, the full term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi]_M + [F]_M = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]

### Step 3: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ must have mass dimension $[\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$ in four spacetime dimensions. Since $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$, we have:
\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting $[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 5$, we find:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions ($[\kappa]_M \geq 0$). Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
