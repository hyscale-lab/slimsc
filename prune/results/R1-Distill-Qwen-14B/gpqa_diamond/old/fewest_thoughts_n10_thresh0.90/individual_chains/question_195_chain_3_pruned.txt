Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about planets transiting and occulting around a star, and the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can do both. 

Alright, let me read the problem again. There's a star with a radius 1.5 times the Sun. The first planet has Earth's radius, is in a circular orbit, and has a transit impact parameter of 0.2. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. I need to find the maximum period of this second planet so that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, transit and occultation. Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, and occultation is when it passes behind the star, so we see the dip in its brightness. But for both to happen, the orbital period must be such that the second planet's orbit is in a certain way relative to the first.

I think the key here is the orbital periods and their ratio. When two planets have orbital periods in a certain ratio, their alignment happens at intervals, allowing transits and occultations. 

Wait, this sounds like it's about the synodic period. The synodic period is the time between similar events (like transits) as observed from Earth. For two planets, the synodic period can be calculated, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the problem says both planets share the same orbital plane, which means their orbits are coplanar. So, it's possible for them to transit and occult each other.

Wait, no, the question is about the second planet exhibiting both transit and occultation events. So, the second planet must pass in front of the star (transit) and behind the star (occultation). For that, the second planet's orbit must be such that when the first planet transits, the second is on the opposite side, and vice versa.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the Hill sphere or the orbital stability. No, maybe it's more about the transit condition. For a planet to transit, it must pass directly in front of the star as viewed from Earth. The impact parameter is 0.2 for the first planet. 

But the second planet's impact parameter would be different. Wait, but the problem says to find the
