Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way. Let me think.

Parallax, right. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) is approximately equal to 1 divided by the parallax (p), where p is in parsecs and d is also in parsecs. So d ≈ 1/p. Oh wait, wait. No, more accurately, d = 1 / p, but p is measured in arcseconds. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If it's 0.5 arcseconds, it's 2 parsecs away.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, how does the count of stars change as the parallax changes. So they're asking for the density of stars in a certain range of parallax.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So the number density in a volume depends on how that volume changes with distance. Because when you're looking at a certain range of parallaxes, you're looking at a thin shell at a certain distance.

Let me think about the volume. The number of stars should depend on the volume of the spherical shell. The volume of a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr is approximately 4πr² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between (r+dr)³ and r³ is approximately 4πr² dr when dr is small.

But how does parallax relate to r? Since p = 1/(r), right. So r = 1/p. So I can express r in terms of p.

So the volume in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * dr. But dr is the change in radius. How does dp relate to dr? Let's see. p = 1/r → r = 1/p. So dr = - (1/p²) dp. The minus sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases.

But I'm looking for the number of stars per unit range of p, so probably looking at the number per dp. Let's denote N as the number of stars in a shell at radius r, with thickness dr. Then N = number density * volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant, say n₀.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of p, which is dp. So for a small dp, the corresponding dr is - (1/p²) dp. So the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 dr = 4π (1/p^2) * (-1/p² dp) ) → the negative just indicates direction, but since we're considering magnitudes, we can ignore the sign. So the volume is 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, dr is (1/p^2) dp, because dr = - (1/p²) dp. So when p increases by dp, r decreases by (1/p²) dp.

So the volume is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp? No, wait, no. Let me do it step by step.

The volume of a thin shell is 4π r² dr. Since r = 1/p, substituting gives 4π (1/p²) dr. But dr is (1/p²) dp, because dr = d(1/p) = - (1/p²) dp. So dr is proportional to (1/p²) dp.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute dV, the volume element in terms of p. The volume element dV in spherical shells is 4π r² dr. But r = 1/p, so dr = - (1/p²) dp. So dV = 4π (1/p²) (-1/p²) dp. So dV = -4π (1/p^4) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases, so the volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p^4) dp, ignoring the sign for now.

But stars are uniformly distributed in space, so their number per unit volume is constant, say n₀. So the number of stars in a shell is N = n₀ * dV = n₀ * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which is dp. So N per unit dp is N/dp = n₀ * 4π (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options
