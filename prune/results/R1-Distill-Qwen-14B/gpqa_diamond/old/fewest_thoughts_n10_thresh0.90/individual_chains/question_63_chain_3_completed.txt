--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. They give me the masses of X and Y as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The question is about finding the momentum of that photon.

Wait, so the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it's more about vibrations. Oh wait, no, wait: the quantum rotation-vibration model combines rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy states are quantized in terms of both rotation and vibration.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state. So the fundamental state would be the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (maybe J=0 or J=1? I'm a bit confused about that).

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state for a diatomic would be J=0. But when you include vibration, the overall energy is a combination of both. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

Now, the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state would be the next available state with the least energy. That would probably involve either increasing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational, whichever requires less energy.

But wait, what's the order of energy levels between rotation and vibration? I think vibrational energy levels are more spaced out than rotational ones for diatomic molecules because the vibrational frequency is higher. So the energy needed to go to the next vibrational state (v=1) is higher than going to the next rotational state (J=1). So if the photon's energy allows, the molecule would prefer to go to the next vibrational state because it's a higher transition.

Wait, but the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's looking for the smallest possible photon energy needed to make a transition. So perhaps it's a transition to the next allowed state, which could be either a change in vibrational or rotational state, but the one that requires the least energy.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, I think the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. So the energy levels are a product of both. But for the fundamental state, it's the lowest possible, so v=0 and J=0.

Wait, but the question is about the next state. So what's the next state? The next higher energy state. That's the first excited state. In a typical rigid rotor plus harmonic oscillator model, the energy levels are E = \left( v + \frac{1}{2} \right) \hbar w + \hbar B J (J+1). So the ground state is v=0, J=0, energy (1/2)ℏw. The first excited state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

Compute the energies. Let me compute the energy difference between the ground state and each possible next state.

First, the ground state energy is (1/2)ℏw.

If the molecule goes to v=1, J=0: energy is (1 + 1/2)ℏw + 0 = (3/2)ℏw. The energy difference ΔE_vib is (3/2 - 1/2)ℏw = ℏw.

If it goes to v=0, J=1: energy is (1/2)ℏw + B*(1)(2) = (1/2)ℏw + 2B. So the energy difference ΔE_rot is 2B.

Which of these two transitions (vib to v=1 or rot to J=1) requires less energy? So I need to compare ℏw and 2B.

But what's B? The rotational constant is given by B = (h^2)/(8 π^2 μ R^2), where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule.

Wait, let's compute μ. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ around 3.02e-27 kg.

But wait, let me compute that accurately. 20 * 2 =40, 20+2=22. So 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ Let's compute that: 1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ around 3.0217e-27 kg.

Now, R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

Now, B = h^2/(8 π² μ R²)

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So let's compute B:

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

Then denominator: 8 π² μ R².

Compute each part:

8 π² ≈ 8 * (9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

μ R² = (3.02e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Denominator is 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.208 = approx 95.36 → 95.36e-46 = 9.536e-45.

So B ≈ h² / denominator → 4.39e-67 / 9.536e-45 ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.536e-45 ≈ (4.39 /9.536) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, let's compute this more precisely.

Let me re-calculate:

h² = (6.62607015e-34)^2 → 6.62607e-34^2 = (6.62607)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 43.904 * 1e-68 = 4.3904e-67 J²s².

Denominator: 8 π² μ R² → 8 * π^2 ≈ 78.9568.

μ R²: 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 → 1.208e-46 kg m².

So denominator = 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 * 1.208.

78 *1.208 = 94.224, 0.9568 *1.208 ≈ 1.155. So total ≈ 94.224 + 1.155 ≈ 95.379 → 95.379e-46 → 9.5379e-45.

So B = h²/(8 π^2 μ R²) = 4.3904e-67 / 9.5379e-45 → 4.3904e-67 / 9.5379e-45 = (4.3904 /9.5379) * 1e-22 → approx 0.46 *1e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

Wait, but wait J is in terms of kg m²/s². So that's correct.

So B ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Now, the energy difference for rotation is 2B = 2 *4.6e-23 =9.2e-23 J.

The energy difference for vibration is ℏw.

ℏ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ℏw =1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

Comparing ΔE_rot=9.2e-23 J and ΔE_vib=4.218e-20 J.

Which is smaller? 9.2e-23 is about 0.00092e-20, which is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the energy required to go from J=0 to J=1 is much less than that for v=0 to v=1.

So the molecule would prefer to absorb a photon that allows it to transition to the next rotational state rather than the vibrational one because it requires less energy.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that requires the least energy. So that would be the rotational transition, because 9.2e-23 J is much less than 4.2e-20 J.

So the photon must supply the rotational energy, which is 2B. So the energy of the photon is 2B=9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Hmm.

Wait, photons have energy E = h f = p c, where p is momentum, c is speed of light.

But E = p c → p = E / c.

Wait, because for a photon, E = pc, since m=0. So yeah, p = E/c.

So if the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) → let's compute that.

9.2e-23 /3e8 = (9.2 /3) * 1e-31 → 3.066...e-31 → approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait but wait, looking at the options, none of them are near 1e-31. Let me look at the options:

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, none of these are near 3e-31. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I messed up the energy levels. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the fundamental state is the first excited state of the vibration, or maybe I should consider the rotational and vibrational contributions differently.

Wait, no, I think the fundamental state is v=0, J=0 because that's the lowest energy. So the next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But from the calculation, J=1 requires much less energy, so the photon would have to match that energy.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering a transition where both the vibrational and rotational states change. Like, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state, and the next state is either v=1 J=0 or v=0 J=1.

But according to the energy differences I computed, the rotational transition is lower. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J. Then the momentum is E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger than that. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the reduced mass or the rotational constant.

Let me recheck the reduced mass.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Converting to kg: 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg → 1.81818 *1.6605 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Wait, that's correct.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms → 2e-10 meters. Correct.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

Wait, let me recompute B.

B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

Compute the denominator: 8 * π² = 8*(9.8696) ≈78.9568.

μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20= 1.208e-46 kg m².

Denominator: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 → 78.9568 *1.208 =approx 95.36e-46 → 9.536e-45.

h²: (6.626e-34)^2= (6.626)^2=43.904 → 43.904e-68=4.3904e-67.

So B=4.3904e-67 /9.536e-45 → 4.3904e-67 /9.536e-45 = (4.3904/9.536) *1e-22 → approx 0.46 *1e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

That's correct. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

But when I compute the photon momentum p=E/c=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger, so I must have misunderstood the question or the approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy required is not 2B but h times the rotational constant? Or perhaps I should consider the rotational energy as B J (J+1), so the ΔE would be B (2J +1) when J increases by 1.

Wait, from J=0 to J=1: ΔE_rot = B [1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = B*(2 -0) =2B → same as before.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy for a transition that includes both rotation and vibration, but I don't think so. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state and switches to the next state, which would be the lowest possible higher energy state.

Wait a second. Let me think about the selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational selection rules are typically ΔJ=±1 (for rotational transitions) and Δv=±1 (for vibrational transitions). But when considering a transition that involves both rotational and vibrational changes, the allowed transitions are when Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1.

But wait, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can change both vibrational and rotational states, but the selection rules are such that for electric dipole transitions, Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1.

So perhaps the photon is causing a change in both vibrational and rotational states. Hmm, but in this case, the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state could be, for example, v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, or even v=1, J=1 (but that would be higher energy than the others).

Wait, but if the molecule absorbs a photon and goes to the next state with the lowest possible energy, that would be the state where the energy is just higher than the current state. So which of the possible next states has the lowest energy?

E1: v=0, J=1 → energy (1/2)ℏw + B*(1)(2).

E2: v=1, J=0 → (3/2)ℏw +0.

Which is lower? Let's compute.

We can compute the two energies.

ΔE for E1: (1/2 ℏw + 2B) - (1/2 ℏw) )=2B.

ΔE for E2: (3/2 ℏw ) - (1/2 ℏ w )= ℏw.

We know from before that ℏw is much larger than 2B.

So E1 is lower than E2. So the photon must have energy 2B, which is about 9.2e-23 J.

But the momentum comes out to be about 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any of the options. So either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something in the model.

Wait, perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which includes vibrational modes. So perhaps the rotational energy levels are not as straightforward, but I think my approach still holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both rotational and vibrational levels change, but that would have higher energy than just the rotational transition.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the energy difference between the ground state (v=0, J=0) and the next state, which is the first excited state. In some models, the first excited state could be a combination of rotational and vibrational changes. But I think the minimal energy transition is the rotational one.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the required photon energy as the rotational energy, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me double-check the B calculation.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

h²= (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²s².

8 π² = approx 78.9568.

μ R²=3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.02e-27 *4e-20=1.208e-46 kg m².

So denominator 8 π² μ R²=78.9568 *1.208e-46= approx95.36e-46=9.536e-45.

So B= h²/(8 pi^2 mu R^2) =4.39e-67 /9.536e-45= approx 4.39/(9.536) *1e-22= 0.46 *1e-22=4.6e-23 J.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J, which is correct.

So E_photon=9.2e-23 J.

p= E/c=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all around 1e-27 or 1e-28. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a transition that includes both rotational and vibrational energy changes. For example, moving from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. Then the energy change is ℏw.

But earlier, I thought that 2B is much smaller than ℏw. But let me compute this.

ℏw=1.05457e-34 *4e14=4.218e-20 J.

Which is much bigger than 2B=9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. So the energy required is ℏw=4.218e-20 J.

Then p=E/c=4.218e-20 /3e8=1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which matches this.

So why did I think the rotational transition was lower? Because 9.2e-23 is 0.00092e-20, which is way less than 4.2e-20. So why is the photon's energy in the vibrational case so much higher?

Hmm, perhaps the question is not about the minimal energy transition but about the next state after the fundamental state. Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state must be the one immediately higher than the fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the ground state, the next state would be the first excited state, which for a combination of rotation and vibration could be a higher vibrational state with lower rotational, or vice versa.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the ordering of energy levels may have the first excited state as the rotational level J=1, because 2B is much smaller than ℏw. So the first state after the ground state would be J=1, v=0. Therefore, the photon's energy would be 2B=9.2e-23 J, p=3e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the molecule is in the v=0 state, but what's the fundamental state? Oh wait, maybe the fundamental state is the state with the lowest vibrational level but the lowest rotational state. So the next state would be either v=1 or J=1.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is D: 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to ℏw, which is the energy for the vibrational transition.

So why would the question be looking for that?

Wait, perhaps the model being used is the non-rigid rotor, which includes both rotation and vibration, and the photon's energy must account for the vibrational part. But why would the rotational part not be lower?

Hmm, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor, the energy levels are not just E = E_vib + E_rot, but some combination that may have a minimum at a certain point. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground rotational state but the ground vibrational state, and the next state is the first vibrational state, which requires a photon of energy ℏw.

Wait, but according to the calculations, the energy needed for the rotational transition is much lower, so the photon's energy would be 2B.

But perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in a state where both rotational and vibrational are excited, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check.

Wait, the given options are in N·s (which is kg·m/s), which is correct for momentum.

Wait, when I compute p for the rotational transition, I get 3e-31 N·s, which is 3e-31 kg m/s. The options are about 1e-27 to 1e-28. That's three or four orders of magnitude higher. So perhaps I made an error in calculating B.

Let me recheck B.

Alternative approach: B is also given by (h/(8 pi mu R^2)) * (1/(2 pi)) )? No, wait, B is h^2/(8 pi^2 mu R^2).

Wait, perhaps I should use the rotational constant in terms of cm^-1, but that's more for spectroscopy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia I = mu R^2, which is 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.02e-27 *4e-20=1.208e-46 kg m².

Then B = h²/(8 pi² I) → which is the same as before.

So B is 4.6e-23 J, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong value for h. Perhaps I should use h=6.626e-34 J·s, which I did.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground state, and the next state is the first vibrational excited state (v=1), but only the vibrational transition, so the photon's energy is ℏw.

If I compute p= (ℏw)/c = (1.05457e-34 *4e14 ) /3e8 = (4.218e-20)/3e8= 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28.

So perhaps the question is considering that the molecule transitions from v=0 to v=1, and ignores the rotational transitions because the question is about the vibration model. Wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so both are considered.

But in that case, the minimal transition would be the rotational one, not the vibrational.

But then why would the answer be option D, which is for the vibrational transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both the vibrational and rotational states change, but that would require a higher energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of both. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase.

Which would require the least energy: to change J or v.

Earlier calculations show that 2B is about 9.2e-23 J, while ℏw is 4.2e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should be 2B.

But my calculation gives p=3e-31, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational part only. Maybe the model is such that the molecule's energy is primarily in vibration, so the next state is the first vibrational state, ignoring rotation.

But that doesn't fit with the question stating it's using the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation for B is wrong. Let me recompute B, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

Plugging in the numbers:

h=6.626e-34,

mu=1.818 amu= 3.02e-27 kg,

R=2e-10 m.

Compute denominator: 8 π² μ R².

8* pi^2 = 8 * (9.8696) ≈78.9568.

mu R^2=3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20=1.208e-46.

So denominator=78.9568 *1.208e-46=95.37e-46=9.537e-45.

h²= (6.626e-34)^2=4.39e-67.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.537e-45 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So I'm back to the same conclusion. The photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rotational constant B with the energy levels. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy in wavenumbers, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon of energy ℏw. Then p= (ℏw)/c=4.218e-20 /3e8=1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But earlier I thought that a rotational transition would require less energy. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is D, assuming that the question is expecting the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of rotation (J=0), and the next state would be the first vibrational state (v=1), regardless of the rotational state. But why would that be the case?

Wait, another point: in a diatomic molecule, the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next state in energy is J=1, which is lower in energy than v=1. So the first excited state would be J=1, v=0.

But according to the energy difference, the photon would only need to provide 2B=9.2e-23 J, which is much less than ℏw=4.2e-20 J.

But the problem is, none of the options match this value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, h is 6.626e-34 J·s. Then h squared is (6.626e-34)^2. Let me compute that precisely.

6.626e-34 *6.626e-34 = (6.626)^2 = about 43.90, so 43.90e-68 =4.39e-67 J²s².

Denominator: 8 pi² mu R² = 8 *9.8696 *3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

mu R²: 3.02e-27 kg * (4e-20 m²) → 3.02 *4 =12.08 → 12.08e-47 kg m².

So 78.9568 *12.08e-47.

Compute 78.9568 *12.08 → approx 78.96 *12 =947.52, 78.96 *0.08=6.3168 → total ~953.8368.

So denominator=953.8368e-47 =9.538e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.538e-45 = (4.39 /9.538) * 1e-22 → approx 0.46 *1e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

Hmm, same result.

So perhaps the problem is not about the minimal energy transition but about a transition that includes both changes, but that would require higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition only, and the rotational part is not considered. But that would contradict the question statement about the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum. Let me re-examine that.

E_photon =2B=9.2e-23 J.

p= E/c=9.2e-23 /3e8 =approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But since that's not an option, perhaps I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is using R in angstroms but I converted it to meters correctly. Yes, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that's not the minimal transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used here is the rigid rotor, not the non-rigid one, but the question says non-rigid.

Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor would include vibrations, but perhaps the rotation is treated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy for the vibrational transition, which is ℏw.

Then, p= ℏw/c= (1.05457e-34 *4e14) /3e8.

Compute numerator:1.05457e-34 *4e14=4.218e-20 J.

p=4.218e-20 /3e8=1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition, not the rotational one.

But why would that be the case? Because the rotational transition requires much less energy, but perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational part.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of rotation, and the next state is the first vibrational state, regardless of rotation.

But according to the energy difference, the rotational transition is lower in energy, so it should be the first.

But since the options don't include the rotational transition's momentum, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the question is only about the vibrational transition.

I think I'm stuck between two possibilities. But given the options, option D matches the vibrational transition's photon momentum. So perhaps the intended answer is D.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the question asks for the momentum of a photon required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   The total energy of the molecule is a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions:
   \[
   E = \left( v + \frac{1}{2} \right) \hbar \omega + \hbar B J (J+1)
   \]
   where \( B \) is the rotational constant:
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2}, \quad \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}
   \]

2. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant \( B \)**:
   Substituting into the formula for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2}
   \]
   Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( R = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), and \( \mu = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \):
   \[
   B \approx \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (3.02 \times 10^{-27})(2 \times 10^{-10})^2} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Energy Differences**:
   - **Rotational Transition**: From \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - **Vibrational Transition**: From \( v=0 \) to \( v=1 \), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \, \text{J} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c}
   \]
   - For the **rotational transition** (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)):
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]
   - For the **vibrational transition** (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)):
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]

6. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)). However, none of the provided options match the rotational transition's momentum (\( p_{\text{rot}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)).

7. **Conclusion**:
   Despite the rotational transition requiring less energy, the question likely assumes the vibrational transition is being considered. This aligns with option **D**, which corresponds to the vibrational transition's momentum:
   \[
   p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
   \]
