Okay, so I have this problem about vector calculus, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. Hmm.

Wait, so the field is given as f(r), which is a vector field. Since it only has a radial component, I can write it as f(r) = [some function] r̂, right? And the magnitude is 1/r², so f(r) must be (1/r²) r̂.

I remember that divergence in spherical coordinates isn't the same as in Cartesian. The formula for divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r) + ... (the other terms are for angular components, but since here the field has no angular components, those terms are zero). So the divergence ∇·f would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)), because A_r is 1/r².

Let me compute that derivative. r² times (1/r²) is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence would be (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Wait, but that would mean the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. Because at r=0, the field isn't defined.

So if I'm integrating ∇·f over the volume of a sphere of radius R, the integral should be zero, right? Because the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at r=0, which is a point of measure zero. But wait, isn't there a theorem related to Gauss's law or something about divergence theorem?

Wait, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

In this case, the surface is a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) on the surface would be (
