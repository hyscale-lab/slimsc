Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, right? So, when it dissolves in an acid, it should react with the acid. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl, HNO3, etc., the reaction should be straightforward.

Let me think about the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base because it's a hydroxide of a transition metal. But when you add a strong acid, it should neutralize the hydroxide. So the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O

Wait, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, right? So each would need a H+ to neutralize, hence the three H+ per formula unit of Fe(OH)3.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The given mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17 g/mol, so three OHs would be 51. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Wait, let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85. Let's see, 0.1 / 100 is 0.001, but 106.85 is a bit more, so maybe around 0.000936 mol. Let me double-check: 106.85 * 0.000936 = approximately 0.1 grams. Yeah, that's right.

Now, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ (from the strong acid) to dissolve. So for 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)3, we need 0.000936 * 3 = 0.002808 mol of H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter (or 100 cm³). So, to find the volume of acid needed, volume (V) = moles (n) / concentration (C). So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait a second—the options don't have 28.08. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close, so that's probably the volume. But wait, the question asks for the minimum volume. So why is that the case?

Because the acid is being added to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, and once enough H+ is present to neutralize all the OH- in Fe(OH)3, the reaction goes to completion. So the minimum volume is when exactly 3 equivalents of H+ are present. So yes, 28.08 cm³ is the minimum. So looking at the options, option C has 28.05. Close enough, probably due to rounding.

But wait, I should make sure my calculation is precise. Let me compute 0.1 / 106.85 again.

0.1 / 106.85 = 0.00093596 mol. Then multiply by 3: 0.00280788 mol H+ needed.

Then, volume is 0.00280788 / 0.1 = 0.0280788 liters = 28.0788 cm³. So rounded to three decimal places, that's 28.08 cm³. But option C is 28.05, which is a bit lower. Could there be a mistake here? Maybe I should check my molar mass again.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol. Each OH group: 16.00 (O) + 1.008 (H) = 17.008 g/mol. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol. Multiply by 3: 0.0028068 mol H+.

Volume = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.07 cm³. So probably the options might have rounded it differently.

Looking at the options:

Option C says 28.05 cm³, which is about that. So the volume is approximately 28.07, so option C is close. But why isn't it exactly 28.08? Well, maybe the question uses a slightly different molar mass, or perhaps I've made a miscalculation.

Wait, the Fe(OH)3 could also dissociate in water, but since we're adding an acid, the dissolution is driven by the acid-base reaction. So the molar calculation should be correct.

Now, the second part is the pH of the solution. After adding the acid, the solution will contain Fe³+ ions and excess H+ from the acid, right?

Wait, let's think about that. The Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ (0.1 L) of solution. We're adding V cm³ of the acid (which is 0.1 M H+). So the total volume is 100 + V cm³ (but since V is much smaller than 100, maybe we can approximate, but perhaps it's better to compute exactly).

But wait, the problem says that the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, the problem says, "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So the solution after dissolving will have a total volume of 100 cm³, meaning that the acid is added to make up that volume? Or does it mean that the solution after adding acid is 100 cm³? That's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says: "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So, I think it means that the final solution has a volume of 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the initial volume before adding acid is 100 cm³ minus the volume of the acid added, but wait, that might complicate things.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says, "dissolve in 100 cm³ total volume." So, perhaps the solution after adding acid is 100 cm³. So we have to add V cm³ of acid to 100 cm³ of solution. But wait, if we have 100 cm³ of solution, and we add V cm³ of acid, the total volume could be 100 + V cm³, but the question says the total volume is 100. So perhaps the acid is being added in such a way that the total volume remains 100 cm³. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the acid is added to 100 cm³ of solution, making the total volume 100 + V. But wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps the acid is being added to a solution that's already 100 cm³, but that doesn't make sense because adding more volume would change it. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpret the question.

Wait, maybe the
