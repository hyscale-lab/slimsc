Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

First, let me understand the problem. The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N. N is the normalization constant, which is given as N = sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is that of a Gaussian reference state.

Wait, but wait. I remember that Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. Schrödinger cat states are superpositions of coherent states, which makes them non-Gaussian. Non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. The relative entropy method compares the given state to a Gaussian one, and the difference in their entropies gives the non-Gaussianity.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (NG) is defined as S(NG) = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Alternatively, sometimes people use the relative entropy between a non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state. So, in this case, del_b would involve computing the entropy of rho and subtracting the entropy of tau.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about what tau is. The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. But which Gaussian state? For a cat state, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a coherent state or a squeezed state? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe it's the Gaussian state that is the closest to the given non-Gaussian state, but perhaps in this problem, it's a coherent state.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first moments as the cat state, but I'm not certain. I think in some cases, people take the reference Gaussian state to be the coherent state closest to the given state. Alternatively, perhaps it's the thermal state or some other Gaussian.

Wait, maybe it's better to first compute the density matrix rho for the given state and then find its von Neumann entropy. Then, find the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau, and subtract the two.

But how do I find tau? The problem doesn’t specify exactly what Gaussian state to use as tau. Hmm. Without knowing what tau is, I can’t compute the relative entropy. But perhaps in this problem, the non-Gaussianity is zero if the state is Gaussian, but the cat state is non-Gaussian, so the nG should be positive. But wait, the options include D) 0, but that would imply it's Gaussian, which I don't think it is.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about what the problem says. The state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. So it's a non-Gaussian state. So the relative entropy measure would be some positive value.

But let me focus on the steps. The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So first, I'll write that down.

Given |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Let me compute the normalization N. Given phi = -pi/4, alpha=0.5.

Let me compute sin(2 phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2 phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065. So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935). Let me compute 0.3935. The square root is approximately 0.6275.

So N ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is:

|psi> = [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, approximately 0.7071. Similarly, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes:

|psi> ≈ (0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5>)/0.6275.

I can write this as |psi> = (|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2) * (1/0.6275).

Wait, because 0.7071 is 1/sqrt(2), approximately 0.7071.

So |psi> ≈ [ (|0.5> - |-0.5>)/sqrt(2) ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but 1/sqrt(2) is about 0.7071, so [1/(0.6275 * 0.7071)] ... Wait, maybe I can compute this normalization factor numerically.

Wait, 0.7071 is approximately sqrt(2)/2. So 0.6275 = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5))≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

But perhaps I can compute |psi> as:

|psi> = (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) / sqrt(2 * [1 - exp(-0.5)]).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me just think about the density matrix rho. The density matrix is |psi><psi|. So rho = (1/N^2) (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) [ |alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ] ).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the density matrix rho in the Fock basis or perhaps use the Wigner function to compute the entropy. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, I can think about the state as
