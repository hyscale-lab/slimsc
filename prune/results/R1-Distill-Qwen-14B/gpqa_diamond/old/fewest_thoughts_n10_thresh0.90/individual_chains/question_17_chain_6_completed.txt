Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about calcium ions and EDTA. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is present. They also mention the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C, but I don't think the temperature affects this calculation directly unless activity coefficients are involved, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, so I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex is usually written as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4−. The formation constant, Kf, is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²−. So the Kf here is 5e10.

But wait, the problem states it's a stochiometric solution. Stochiometric means that the amounts are in the exact molar ratio as the reaction. So in this case, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that implies that all the calcium and EDTA are tied up in the complex, right? Or does it mean that the initial concentrations of calcium and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio?

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let me think. The formation of the complex can be written as:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²−, Kf = 5e10.

The given solution has 0.02 M of CaEDTA²−. So, initially, perhaps there's 0.02 M of the complex. But wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so when it complexes with Ca²+, each EDTA molecule binds one Ca.

Alternatively, maybe the solution starts with 0.02 M of the complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be in the solution?

Wait no, because when the complex forms, each mole of Ca²+ binds with a mole of EDTA^4−. So if we have 0.02 M of the complex, that would mean that the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be 0.02 M each, but in reality, they form the complex, so the free Ca²+ and EDTA^4− concentrations would be very low.

Wait, no. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which is the complex, then the initial state is that all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex. But wait, that's not possible because the complex is the product of the reaction. So the initial concentrations before complex formation would be the sum of the complex and any dissociated species.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So, the equilibrium expression is Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−].

In this case, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. Let me assume that the dissociation is negligible because Kf is very large (5e10 is a big number), so the complex is mostly intact. But wait, no. Wait, Kf is a formation constant, which is for the formation of the complex. So the larger the Kf, the more the complex forms, meaning that the concentration of the complex is much higher than the uncomplexed ions.

But in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So the initial condition is that [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But I think the problem assumes that the solution is made by dissolving the complex, so there's no excess Ca²+ or EDTA^4− initially. So the complex dissociates a little, but because Kf is large, the dissociation is minimal. So we can model this using the Kf expression.

Let me denote x as the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium:
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, since x is very small compared to 0.02.

So Kf = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02 = 5e10.

So x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) → x = 3.16e4 M? Wait, that can't be right because 3e4 is much larger than 0.02 M. That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, 5e10 * 0.02 is 1e9. So x² = 1e9 → x is sqrt(1e9) which is 31623 M, which is way higher than 0.02 M. That's impossible because the concentration x can't be higher than 0.02 M if the complex is 0.02 M. So that suggests that my assumption that [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I got the setup wrong. Let me think again. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, each complex gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−. So the initial concentrations before dissociation are [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA^4−] = 0. After dissociation, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x.

So Kf = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x² ≈ 5e10 * 0.02 → x² = 1e9 → x = 3.16e4 M. But that's 31623 M, which is way larger than the initial 0.02 M. That's impossible because you can't have more Ca²+ than the complex you started with. So the assumption that x is small is invalid.

Hmm, so that suggests that the initial assumption is wrong, and the approximation doesn't hold. So I need to solve the equation without the approximation.

So Kf = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.

So x² = 5e10 * (0.02 - x).

Expanding:

x² = 1e9 -5e10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5e10 x - 1e9 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in x. Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

Here, a=1, b=5e10, c= -1e9.

Wait, the equation is x² + 5e10 x -1e9 =0. So a=1, b=5e10, c= -1e9.

Discriminant D = (5e10)^2 +4*1*1e9 = 25e20 +4e9 ≈25e20 (since 4e9 is negligible compared to 25e20).

So D ≈ 25e20 → sqrt(D) =5e10.

So x = [ -5e10 ± 5e10 ] / 2.

We take the positive root because concentration can't be negative.

So x = [ (-5e10 +5e10 ) ] /2 → 0/2=0 → which can't be right.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make an error in the quadratic setup?

Wait, the equation was x² = 5e10*(0.02 -x).

So x² = (5e10)*0.02 - (5e10)x.

Which rearranges to x² +5e10 x - (5e10*0.02) = 0.

Wait, 5e10 *0.02 is 1e9. So equation becomes x² +5e10 x -1e9=0.

So a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.

So x = [-5e10 ± sqrt( (5e10)^2 +4*1*1e9 ) ] / (2*1).

Again, (5e10)^2 is 25e20, 4*1e9 is 4e9, so sqrt is approximately 5e10.

So numerator is -5e10 +5e10 =0. The other root is negative, which we ignore. So x=0, which can't be right.

Hmm, this suggests that the initial assumption that the complex is 0.02 M is the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA is wrong. Maybe I should consider that the solution has 0.02 M of the complex, but the complex itself is at equilibrium with the dissociated ions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Another approach: The total concentration of Ca is the sum of free Ca²+ and the Ca bound in the complex. But the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps the total concentration of Ca²+ is equal to the concentration of the complex, because each complex has one Ca²+ ion.

Wait, but that's not quite right because some of the complex dissociates. So the actual concentration of Ca²+ is [Ca²+] = x, and the complex is 0.02 - x. But since the dissociation is small, perhaps x is negligible compared to 0.02, so [Ca²+] ≈ x, and the complex is approximately 0.02 M.

Wait, but earlier that led to x being 3e4, which is impossible. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the complex is the only source, and the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, but I'm not considering that the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA is 0.02 M each.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as follows:

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−. So the total concentration of Ca²+ is x, and the same for EDTA^4−. The complex concentration is 0.02 - x.

So Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−] = (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

Again, same equation as before. But when I tried solving it, I get x≈0, which isn't possible. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the EDTA is in excess. But the problem says 'stochiometric' which might imply that the EDTA and Ca are present in a 1:1 ratio, so all the Ca is complexed, but that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the solution is 0.02 M in Ca²+ initially, and the same for EDTA, leading to the formation of the complex. So the total concentration of Ca is 0.02 M, and all of it is complexed. But that can't be the case because some would dissociate.

Alternatively, maybe the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA is 0.02 M as well because each complex uses one EDTA and one Ca.

Wait, perhaps the total concentration of Ca species is 0.02 M, which includes both free Ca²+ and the complex. So [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. Similarly for EDTA: [EDTA^4−] + [CaEDTA²−] =0.02 M.

Wait, but then if Kf is very large, most of the Ca and EDTA would be in the complex form. So [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] would be very small.

So setting up the equations:

Let x = [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4−].

Then, [CaEDTA²−] =0.02 -x.

Kf = x²/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² ≈5e10 *0.02 → x²=1e9 → x=3.16e4 M. But that's impossible because 3e4 is way bigger than 0.02.

Hmm, so my approximation can't hold. Therefore, x isn't negligible. So how else can I approach this?

Another thought: if Kf is so large (5e10), the complex doesn't dissociate much. So [Ca²+] would be very small, much smaller than 0.02 M. Therefore, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So why am I getting x as 3e4? That can't be. Maybe I'm getting confused between formation and dissociation constants.

Wait, formation constant Kf is [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So in this case,

Kf= [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])=5e10.

Then, rearranged,

[Ca²+][EDTA^4−] = [CaEDTA²−]/(5e10).

Given that [CaEDTA²−]=0.02 M,

[Ca²+][EDTA^4−] = 0.02 /5e10 =4e-13.

But in a 1:1 complex, the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− should be the same, so [Ca²+]^2 =4e-13 → [Ca²+]=sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5= about 3.16e-7 M.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me see. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in this case, it's forming a 1:1 complex with Ca²+.

But wait, in reality, EDTA is usually present in excess to form the complex, but in this problem, perhaps it's a stoichiometric solution, meaning that the concentrations are exactly 1:1.

Wait, but the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So if all the Ca is complexed, then [Ca²+] =0. But that can't be the case because the complex can dissociate, so some Ca²+ is free.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the problem considering that the total concentration of Ca is 0.02 M, all of which is in the complex. But that can't be right because some would dissociate.

Wait, perhaps the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So the total Ca concentration is 0.02 M, which comes from the complex. So [Ca²+] = x, and [CaEDTA²−] =0.02 - x. But that can't be right because the complex includes the Ca.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try a different approach.

Let's denote:

Total concentration of Ca is [Ca_total] = [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA²−] =0.02 M.

Because the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, which is the only source of Ca. So [CaEDTA²−] =0.02 - [Ca²+].

But wait, the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the total EDTA is [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4−] + [CaEDTA²−] = [EDTA^4−] + (0.02 - [Ca²+]).

But since the problem states it's a stochiometric solution, maybe the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are both 0.02 M, and they react to form the complex. But that would suggest that the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are zero, which isn't possible. So perhaps the solution has 0.02 M of the complex, and some free Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem as having the complex already present at 0.02 M, and the solution is at equilibrium. So the formation constant Kf applies, and the concentration of Ca²+ is what we're after.

So, Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−] =5e10.

But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−, then [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M.

Let me denote [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−]= y.

So Kf = x y / 0.02 =5e10 → x y = (5e10)(0.02)=1e9.

But in a 1:1 complex, the stoichiometry requires that x = y because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−.

So x = y → x^2 =1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M. That's way too high, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the stoichiometry wrong. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, does it form a 1:1 complex with Ca²+? I think it does. Each EDTA molecule binds one Ca²+.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

In the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The formation of the complex is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− → CaEDTA²−, Kf =5e10.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA²−] =0.02 M.

Let’s denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x, and free EDTA^4− as y.

So Kf = x y / (0.02) =5e10 → x y = 1e9.

But since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, the total EDTA is [EDTA_total] = y +0.02. Similarly, the total Ca is [Ca_total] =x +0.02.

But the problem states that the solution is stochiometric, which I think implies that the initial amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are in a 1:1 ratio. So [Ca_total] = [EDTA_total] =0.02 M.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.02 M of the complex would require 0.02 M of each reactant initially. No, wait, actually, if you start with 0.02 M of each, they would form 0.02 M of the complex, but some would remain as free ions.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations are 0.02 M for the complex, and zero for free ions. But that's not possible because the complex can dissociate.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the solution has 0.02 M of the complex, and the total concentrations of Ca and EDTA are both 0.02 M. So:

[Ca_total] = [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA²−] = x +0.02 =0.02 → x=0, which can't be right because some dissociation must occur.

Wait, that can't be possible because if [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02, then the total Ca would be 0.02 + x, which would be more than 0.02 M. But according to the problem statement, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, which is the only source of Ca and EDTA. So maybe the total Ca is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA is 0.02 M.

So [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA²−] =0.02.

Similarly, [EDTA^4−] + [CaEDTA²−]=0.02.

So from these, [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4−], because [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 - [Ca²+].

So substituting into Kf:

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−] = [Ca²+]^2 / (0.02 - [Ca²+]) ) =5e10.

Let me denote [Ca²+] =x.

So x^2 / (0.02 - x) =5e10.

Multiply both sides by (0.02 -x):

x^2 =5e10 (0.02 -x).

Which is x^2 =1e9 -5e10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x^2 +5e10 x -1e9 =0.

This is a quadratic equation in x.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -5e10 ± sqrt( (5e10)^2 +4*1*1e9 ) ] / (2*1).

Compute the discriminant:

(5e10)^2 =25e20.

4*1*1e9=4e9.

So sqrt(25e20 +4e9) ≈ sqrt(25e20) =5e10.

So,

x= [ -5e10 +5e10 ] / 2 → 0, which is not possible.

x= [ -5e10 -5e10 ] /2 → -5e10, which is negative. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't considering the stoichiometry correctly.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of Ca²+ can be found by rearranging the Kf expression.

We have [Ca²+] = (Kf * [CaEDTA²−]) / [EDTA^4−].

But without knowing [EDTA^4−], that's not helpful. Unless we make an assumption that [EDTA^4−] is negligible, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, because Kf is so large, the concentration of the complex is almost entirely formed, so [Ca²+] is approximately equal to [EDTA^4−], and both are much smaller than [CaEDTA²−].

Wait, but [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. So,

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/0.02 ≈5e10.

Assuming [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4−] =x,

x^2 /0.02 ≈5e10 → x^2=5e10 *0.02=1e9 → x=3.16e4 M. That's impossible.

I must be making a mistake here. Let me think about this differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and the free ion concentration is negligible, but that's not possible because Kf is so high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the concentration of Ca²+ is equal to the concentration of the complex.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the complex is CaEDTA²−, which includes a Ca²+ ion. So each mole of complex contributes one mole of Ca²+.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Let me think about the dissociation of the complex.

The reaction is CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−, with K = 1/Kf.

So K = 1/(5e10) =2e-11.

So K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−] =2e-11.

Let [Ca²+] =x, [EDTA^4−]=x, [CaEDTA²−]=0.02 -x.

So,

x^2 / (0.02 -x) =2e-11.

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

Then,

x² = 2e-11 *0.02 =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) =2e-6.5 → approximately 3.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which is about twice this. Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2/(1e6.5) → 1e6.5 is about 3.16e6, so 2/(3.16e6)= 6.3e-7.

Ah, so x= approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaEDTA²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}, \quad K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}.
\]

### Key Assumptions and Setup:
1. The concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is given as 0.02 M.
2. Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = [ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\).
3. The dissociation of the complex is small, so \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\).

The equilibrium expression for \(K_f\) is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
K_f = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = K_f \cdot 0.02 = (5 \times 10^{10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1 \times 10^9.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{1 \times 10^9} = 3.16 \times 10^4 \, \text{M}.
\]

This result is unreasonably large compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M), indicating that the assumption \(x \ll 0.02\) is invalid. Therefore, the dissociation of the complex is not negligible, and the problem must be re-evaluated.

### Alternative Approach:
Instead, consider the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}, \quad K = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] = 0.02 - x\),
- \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x\),
- \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\).

The equilibrium expression for \(K\) is:

\[
K = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
K = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = K \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
