Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The result is a conjugate addition, forming an enolate intermediate, which then tautomerizes or further reacts. 

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out the products for each. Let's take them one by one.

Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH.

So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? It's a dienolate, so it can act as a nucleophile in conjugate additions. The other compound is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CHCO2Me with a p-tolyl group on the β carbon. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula is E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure is CH2=C(Tolyl)CO2Me? Or is the double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-O-Me with a p-tolyl group at position 3, which is the β position of the acrylate. So the structure is CH2=C(p-Tolyl)CO2Me? No wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me. The substituent is at the 3-position, which is the CH2 position? Hmm, maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-C(O)O-Me with the double bond between C2 and C3, and the p-tolyl group is on C3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2=CH-C(O)O-Me but with a p-tolyl group substituting the CH2. So the structure is CH2=C(p-Tolyl)CO2Me? But that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(CO2Me)(p-Tolyl). Wait, that can't be because the double bond is between C1 and C2 for acrylate. So the molecule is CH2=CHCO2Me, but with a p-tolyl group on the β-carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-Tolyl)CO2Me. Wait, no. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. So it's CH2=CH-C(OR)-p-Tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-O-Me but with a p-tolyl group on the β carbon, which is the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=CH-p-Tolyl-CO-O-Me? No, that's not right. Maybe I should think of it as (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me with the p-tolyl at the β position. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, the COO-Me is at C3, and p-tolyl is at C3 as well? Wait, that can't be because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituent would be on C2. So maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-Tolyl)CO2Me. That makes sense. So the α,β-unsaturated ester is CH2=C(p-Tolyl)CO2Me.

Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. It's a good nucleophile because it's a sultone or a strong electron-withdrawing group, but wait, no. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO–)2CH-. It can act as a nucleophile in conjugate additions.

So in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the β-carbon (the CH2 of CH2=C(p-Tolyl)CO2Me) because the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl makes the β carbon more electrophilic. 

So when the nucleophile (malonate) attacks the β carbon, it would add to it. Let me think about the structure. The malonate has two methyl ester groups, so the structure is CH2(CO2Me)2–. It's a dienolate, so each of the two carboxylate groups can attack. But wait, in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile is the enolate. So the malonate ion would attack the α,β-unsaturated ester.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the reaction. The dimethyl malonate under basic conditions (NaOEt) would deprotonate to form the enolate. So the enolate would attack the β position of the α,β-unsaturated ester.

So the α,β-unsaturated ester is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=C(p-Tolyl)CO2Me. So the β carbon is the one attached to the p-tolyl group.

Wait, no: the α is next to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is at C3, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but the CH2 at C1 has a p-tolyl group. So the structure is CH2(C6H4-paraMe)=CH-CO2Me. Wait, no, the 3-(p-tolyl) refers to the position on the acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. The 3 position would be the CH2 next to the carbonyl. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-Me)COO-Me.

So the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-Me)COO-Me. So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon (the CH2), it would add to that carbon.

So the enolate is CH2(CO2Me)2–. When it attacks the β position, the CH2 would add the enolate. So the product would have the malonate group adding to the CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the product as a new carbon-carbon bond formed between the nucleophile (malonate's enolate) and the β carbon. So the product would be the addition of the malonate to the β position, leading to a new structure.

So after the addition, the product would have the malonate connected to the β carbon. So the structure would be CH2(CO2Me)–C(C6H4-p-Me)(CH2(CO2Me)2). Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think of the product as a new ester.

Alternatively, the Michael addition would result in a new carbon chain. Let me think of the two reactants:

- The nucleophile is the enolate from dimethyl malonate: CH2(CO2Me)2–.
- The electrophilic component is the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: CH2=C(C6H4-p-Me)CO2Me.

The enolate attacks the β position (the CH2 in CH2=C), so the product would be adding the enolate to that CH2. So the product would have a new single bond between the enolate's carbon and the β carbon.

So the structure would be:

COOCH3
||
CH2–C(C6H4-p-Me)–CH(COOCH3)2

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, the product could be a trimethyl ester. So the product would have three ester groups. Let me think: the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) is CH2– with two COOCH3 groups. So when it attacks the β carbon, which is part of CH2=C(C6H4-p-Me)CO2Me, it would form a new carbon-carbon bond.

So the product would be CH2(COOCH3)2–CH2–C(C6H4-p-Me)–COOCH3. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a four-carbon chain with three ester groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is a new molecule where the malonate adds to the β position. So the reaction would produce a new ester where the malonate's enolate is now attached to the β carbon of the acrylate.

So the product would be something like:

(CH2(COOCH3)2)–CH2–C(C6H4-p-Me)–COOCH3.

Wait, but that would be a five-carbon molecule? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trimethyl ester with three COOCH3 groups attached to a propane chain.

Wait, perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Let me see: propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have three COOCH3 groups on a propane. So the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
O
|
C
|
CH2-C(C6H4-p-Me)-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the product as a result of the Michael addition. The enolate would attack the β carbon, adding a CH2(COOCH3)2 group to that position. So the new structure would have a CH2(COOCH3)2 attached to the β carbon. So the product would be CH2( COOCH3 )2–CH2–C(C6H4-p-Me)–COOCH3. That would make a four-carbon chain, but perhaps with three ester groups. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the product would have the structure where the malonate's enolate adds to the β position, leading to a longer chain. So the original acrylate has three carbons (CH2=CHCOOCH3), but with the p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, no, the 3-(p-tolyl) acrylate is CH2=C(C6H4-p-Me)COOCH3, right? So it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-Me)-COOCH3.

Then the Michael addition would add the malonate's enolate to the β carbon (the CH2 of the CH2=). So the product would have that CH2 now connected to the malonate's CH2(COOCH3)2.

So the product would be CH2(COOCH3)2–CH2–C(C6H4-p-Me)–COOCH3.

Wait, but that would have four carbons, with two esters on the first carbon, another on the third. So the name would be something like 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate trimethyl ester. So option A for product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which matches the first part.

So reaction (A) product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Looking at the options, both A and B have this as product A, but let's hold on for the others.

Reaction (B): 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with MeOH and H3O+.

Hmm, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-C≡N. So (E)-but-2-enenitrile would have the substituents on opposite sides, but the structure is CH2=CH-C≡N. So the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.

The other reactant is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So this is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene group attached at position 1. So the structure is a six-membered ring (piperidine) with a cyclohexene substituent at one position.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile would attack the β carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile. So the nitrile is the electron-withdrawing group, making the β carbon electrophilic.

So the nucleophile is the piperidine ring. Wait, but piperidine is a cyclic amine. So under acidic conditions (H3O+), perhaps the piperidine is protonated, making it a better leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, the piperidine could act as a nucleophile. But wait, the Michael reaction requires a strong enough nucleophile. Piperidine is a weak nucleophile, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can deprotonate or act as a base.

Wait, but the reaction uses MeOH and H3O+. So perhaps the conditions are acidic. In such cases, the cyclohexene ring might be protonated, making it more electrophilic.

Wait, wait, but the Michael reaction typically involves a conjugate addition. So the nucleophile would attack the β carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl or nitrile.

So the nitrile is the electrophile. So the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-C≡N. The β carbon is the CH2 next to the nitrile.

So the nucleophile would attack this CH2, adding to it. The nucleophile is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine.

Wait, but the piperidine has a cyclohexene group at C1. So perhaps the cyclohexene ring is a conjugated system. Or does the piperidine ring itself act as the nucleophile? Hmm, piperidine is a secondary amine; it's a weak base but can potentially act as a nucleophile under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is part of the enolate. Wait, no, because the conditions are acidic (H3O+). So maybe the cyclohexene ring is part of the enolate.

Wait, maybe the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the α,β-unsaturated nitrile to form an enamine or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the piperidine attacks the β carbon of the nitrile.

So the product would have the cyclohexenylpiperidine attached to the β carbon of the nitrile.

So the product structure would be cyclohexenylpiperidine attached to CH2, which is connected to another CH2 and then the nitrile. Wait, no. The Michael addition would add the nucleophile to the β carbon, so the product would be:

Nitrile (C≡N) attached to CH2–CH2– (with the nucleophile attached to the middle CH2).

Wait, but the nucleophile is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So the attack would form a new carbon-nitrogen bond? No, wait, the nucleophile is the piperidine attacking the β carbon. So the product would be CH2–(cyclohexenylpiperidine)–CH2–C≡N.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, so the structure is CH2=CH–C≡N
