Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm.

Alright, the operator is P, and we're looking at its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, operators like spin have eigenvalues that correspond to their possible outcomes when measured.

The components given are P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. That probably means n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since the x-z plane implies no y-component. Or wait, the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, so it's (n_x, 0, n_z), but since it's a direction, it's a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1.

Wait, but quantum mechanical operators for spin in an arbitrary direction are given by the vector product of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So the operator for spin in direction n is (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2. But in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator P is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) * ħ/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator is called P, but I think in this context, P is the spin operator, perhaps. So the operator along direction n is given by P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), because n_y is zero.

So, the matrix form of the operator P is (n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]) multiplied by ħ/2.

So let me compute
