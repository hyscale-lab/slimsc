Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand what each spectrograph can detect. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—brighter than 17, meaning magnitude less than 17 because lower numbers are brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars down to about 17 mag. HIRES can see brighter than 16 mag, so it's a bit more sensitive, can see fainter stars (since higher mag is fainter). So HIRES can see stars up to 16 mag, which is brighter (lower mag) than ESPRESSO's limit.

The question is which stars can be seen by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 (since HIRES can't see beyond that) and less than or equal to 17 (since ESPRESSO can't see beyond that). Wait, no, wait—each instrument can observe stars brighter than a certain mag. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO (so V <17), and for HIRES, V <16. So the limiting factor is the lower of the two, which is 16. So the star must have V <16 to be detectable by both.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, so ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So a star with V=17 can't be observed by ESPRESSO, because it's exactly the limit. Because it's "brighter than 17". So if a star is at 17, it's not. So the maximum V for ESPRESSO is 17 mag. For HIRES, maximum V is 16 mag. So a star must have V less than 16 to be seen by both. Because if it's V=16, HIRES can't see it? Wait, no—wait, the wording says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So if a star is brighter than 17, meaning
