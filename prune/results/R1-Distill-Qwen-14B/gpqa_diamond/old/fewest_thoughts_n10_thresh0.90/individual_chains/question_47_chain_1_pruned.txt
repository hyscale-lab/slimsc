Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by breaking down the information provided and see if I can work through it step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C9H11NO2. The general formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N of rings and double bonds)/2. Here, X is zero. So:

C =9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

So, 2*9 +2 =20. 20 -11=9. Then, add N (since each N adds one? Or wait, no. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That's (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2=5 degrees. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees: three double bonds) plus maybe an amide group (which has a double bond) and an ester or something else.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are broad, which usually suggests N-H or O-H stretches. But the region is around 3300-3400, which is more likely N-H (amide or amine) or maybe an O-H like in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the presence of two bands could indicate two different types of N-H groups, like in a secondary amine, but more likely, it's in an amide where the two N-H stretches are present. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine with different environments, but more likely, it's an amide.

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group. 1720 is a bit on the higher side, which is typical for esters (maybe around 1740-
