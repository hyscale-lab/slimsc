Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this. 

Alright, the setup: Two planets orbit a star. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth; Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth. 

Wait, but the question isn't about their masses or radii directly. It's about their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star.

The question gives data about their RV shifts. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å in [OI] line, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. Oh, but wait, how does that relate to their distances?

I remember that the radial velocity method measures the star's Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (V) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) * (1 AU/(1 year))^2 ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (1 + m/M)^ )... wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula I know.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so we can ignore that. Also, sin i is probably 90 degrees because they detected via transit, so sin i is 1. So, K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait no, wait. The formula is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/3) )

But perhaps I should approach this differently. For small planet masses compared to the star, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (2π / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the relation between K and the planet's orbital period or semi-major axis.

Wait, I also know that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_total^(2/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²)) ) * ( ( (1 day) )^{-1/3} ) ) × something else... Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (28.4 m/s) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * (M_star / M_sun)^(-2/3) * (P / day )^(-1/3) * ( (1 - e²) )^(-1/2) )

But since e=0, and sin i=1 (transit implies edge-on orbit, so i=90, sin i=1), and P is the orbital period in days.

Wait, but I don't have the period. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 for each planet.

Wait, the question states that Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 0.04 Å. But wait, how does the RV shift relate to K? Oh because the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. Each planet's presence causes the star to move, which shifts the spectral lines. The size of the shift (K) is a measure of the star's velocity towards and away from us.

So, for each planet, the semi-amplitude K is given. So K1 = 0.03 Å, K2 = 0.04 Å.

Wait, but wait, the units. The shift in wavelength is 0.03 Å for Planet1. The [OI] line is at 6300 Å, so
