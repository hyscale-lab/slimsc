Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials A and B that, when treated with different reducing agents, produce specific products. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The products given are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. Oh, no, actually, each reaction produces the same product but with different stereochemistry. Reaction A gives (R)-4-ethyl... and reaction B gives (S)-4-ethyl... So, the question is about how the starting material's configuration affects the product when using different reducing agents.

The reagents used are LiBH4 and BH3. I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but what's the difference between LiBH4 and BH3 in this context? Oh right, BH3 is typically used as a reagent in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration, but wait, maybe this is more about ketone reductions. Wait, no, LiBH4 is a borohydride that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But wait, in some cases, especially with certain functional groups, the reducing agent might influence the product's stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait another thing: the products are tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-ones. That sounds like a cyclic ether, specifically a tetrahydropyran ring with a ketone group. How do you form that from a starting material? Oh, perhaps via an intramolecular hemiacetal formation or some kind of cyclization during reduction.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketones or esters that upon reduction form cyclic ethers. Alternatively, maybe they're some kind of hemiacetal or acetal-forming structures. Let me think. Oh, wait, the starting materials are in the options, so perhaps they're related to the products via a reduction mechanism.

Looking at the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, structure-wise, that would be a pentanoic acid with substituents. Let me try to draw that. The pentanoic acid has five carbons, with a carboxylic acid group on the first carbon. Then, the third carbon (since it's 3-ethyl) has an ethyl group. The fifth carbon (since it's 5-isobutoxy) has an isobutoxy group (OCH2CH(CH2)2?), and the same carbon also has an oxo group (a ketone, so maybe a carbonyl). So it's 5-oxo, 5-isobutoxy, 3-ethyl pentanoic acid.

Hmm, so the structure would be something like:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2)2 ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me structure it correctly. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, wait, perhaps:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH (with ethyl group)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: C(O)O- (isobutoxy group attached here?)

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - C(ethyl) - CH2 - C(O)O-CH(CH2CH2) ?

Wait, maybe I should think of it as: 

The molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, pentanoic acid is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5. So, carbon 3 would have an ethyl group, and carbon 5 would have both an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, but wait: 5-oxo would be a ketone on carbon 5. Carbon 5 is also attached to an isobutoxy group. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-CH(CH2)2)?

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure as:

The pentanoic acid has the formula CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-CH2CH(CH2)2)

Wait, no, the isobutoxy group is OCH2CH(CH2)2? Or is it OCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, isobutoxy is O(CH2CH(CH3)2?) No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, so isobutoxy would be OCH2CH(CH3)2. Or wait, is isobutoxy O(CH2CH2CH2CH3) no, wait, no. Wait, isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the isobutoxy group is OCH2CH(CH3)2.

So, the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - CH2 - C(O) - OCH2CH(CH3)2

Wait, but that doesn't seem to be a ketone. Wait, 5-oxo would be a ketone on carbon 5. So the structure is:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: C=O (ketone) and attached to that is OCH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that would make the structure:

CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2C(O)OCH2CH(CH3)2

Wait, but how does that become a tetrahydropyran upon reduction?

Hmm, perhaps when reducing, the ester or the ketone is involved. Let me think about the reaction.

In reaction A, starting material A is treated with LiBH4 and H+. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Similarly, reaction B uses BH3 and H+ to give the S form.

Wait, but what's the difference between LiBH4 and BH3? LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters,
