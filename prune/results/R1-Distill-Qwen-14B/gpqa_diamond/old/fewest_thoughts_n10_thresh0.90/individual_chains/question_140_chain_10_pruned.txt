Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm. Let's see what the question says.

The problem talks about a substance X reacting violently with liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is close to the melting point of water, which is 273 K. Wait, 277 is a bit higher, so maybe B is something like ice? Or maybe another substance with a similar melting point.

Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Oh, that gives a clue. Common reagents include things like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7, but wait, no. Another possibility is something like iodine or something else.

Wait, another point is that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X probably has elements with isotopes. Also, when X reacts with Y (probably a liquid metal or maybe a base?), it produces gas W, which has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about gases. So, what gases have equal protons and neutrons?

Let's think about possible gases. For example, O2: O has atomic number 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. Neutrons per O would be 8 if it's O-16 (since 16-8=8). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in each molecule. That fits. But wait, O is an element, so the gas could be O2. Or another possibility is CO2, but that's a molecule with more atoms. Wait, no, the molecule should have same number of protons and neutrons. Let's see:

Wait, W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for a molecule, say, H2O: each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So H2O has 2+8=10 protons. Neutrons: H has 0 (assuming protium), O has 8. So total neutrons would be 8. 10 protons vs 8 neutrons—doesn't match. So that's not it.

What about CO2? Each C has 6 protons. O has 8. So CO2 has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (assuming C-12), O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8 = 22 neutrons. Oh, 22 protons and 22 neutrons—so that's a possibility. But CO2 is a molecule, so W could be CO2. Alternatively, maybe it's a different gas. Another option is CH4: 6 (C) + 4(1) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C would have 6 (C-12), each H has 0. So 6 neutrons. Doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like NH3. Protons: 1 (N) + 3*1 = 4. Neutrons: N has 7 (if it's N-14?), so 7 + 3*0 =7. 4 vs 7, no. Doesn't fit.

Another option: Let's think about heavier atoms. What about Cl2? Cl has atomic number 17. So each Cl has 17 protons. Neutrons for Cl-35 would be 18, but for Cl-37, 20. So Cl2 would have 34 protons and 36 or 38 neutrons. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like D2O? No, that's not a common gas. Or maybe it's a noble gas? Let's see. Let's think about Ne, which is a noble gas. Ne has atomic number 10, so 10 protons. Ne is a monoatomic gas. What about Ne itself? Its atomic mass is about 20. So, Ne has 10 protons, and 10 neutrons (since 20-10=10). So, Ne has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So the molecule (since it's monoatomic) would have 10 each. That fits. So W could be Ne.

But wait, another thought: the gas could be something like C2H4. Let's see. C has 6, H has 1. So protons: (2*6) + (4*1) =12 +4=16. Neutrons
