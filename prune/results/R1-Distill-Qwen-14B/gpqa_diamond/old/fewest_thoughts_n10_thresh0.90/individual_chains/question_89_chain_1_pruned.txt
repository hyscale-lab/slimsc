Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on adamantane structures, but I'll try to visualize it.

First, the initial reaction: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Because KOH is a base, it probably deprotonates and removes the leaving groups, leading to a double bond formation. So, product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond somewhere.

The NMR data for product 1 might help confirm this. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a downfield shift, which often indicates an -OH group or an alkene's vinylic protons. Wait, but in this case, since it's an elimination product, it's more likely the alkene protons. But wait, 4.79 isn't super downfield for vinylic. Oh, maybe it's an epoxide? No, wait, KOH isn't usually used for epoxidation; that's more like H2O2 and an acid catalyst. So probably an alkene.

Looking at the IR spectrum, the product has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong peak, often indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Wait, but if the first step is elimination, I would expect an alkene, not a carbonyl. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the first reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the first step is a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene, but then perhaps further reaction? Or perhaps I'm misreading the conditions. Heated with excess KOH—could it be a substitution reaction instead? But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not adjacent; wait, no, wait, the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure, right? So when heated with KOH, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but if the product's IR shows a carbonyl, that suggests maybe an E2 elimination forming a ketone. Wait, no, E2 would form an alkene, not a ketone. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the first step is more complex. Oh, wait, sometimes when dihalides are treated with strong bases, they can form epoxides if it's a cyclic ether, but that's not the case here. Or perhaps a Grignard-like reaction, but KOH is more of a base than a nucleophile in that case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. KOH is a strong base. So elimination would occur, forming a double bond. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. For vinylic protons in a trans configuration, they usually appear around 4-5 ppm. So this fits. The other peaks: 2.41-2.23 (10H) are probably the adamantane's CH2 groups, and 1.94 (2H) could be another set of CH2, maybe near the double bond.

But then the IR has 1720 cm^-1. That doesn't align with an alkene. Oh wait, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Another possibility: if it's a dehydrohalogenation but then some other reaction. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. But how? Because 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could lead to a substitution if there's a neighboring H, but that would require a SN2 mechanism. But adamantane is a very rigid structure, so maybe the bromine is in a position that allows for such a substitution. Wait, but with two leaving groups, perhaps a double substitution occurs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is an elimination forming a carbonyl. Oh! Wait a second, if we have two adjacent bromides, perhaps the base can abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of a carbocation, which is then deprotonated to form a carbonyl. But that doesn't make much sense because the carbocation would be in a very stable structure (adamantane is very stable), but I'm not sure if that leads to a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. Wait, but the IR would show an epoxide's C-O-C stretching around 1200-1300 cm^-1, not 1720. So that's not right.

Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone. How could that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Hmm. Maybe the bromide leaves, and a neighboring OH group forms, but that's not leading me anywhere. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to an alkene, but then further oxidation occurs. But the conditions here are KOH, which is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid catalyst commonly used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts, but if product 1 is an alkene, maybe it's a diene. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then aluminum isopropoxide might help in some kind of acylation. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should look at the next step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added. Ozone is used for ozonolysis of alkenes. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it.

Wait, but product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. Then, we look at the NMR of product 3.

Wait, let's try this again. Let me outline all the steps.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid)
   - Possible reaction: elimination → alkene (maybe 1,3-adamantadiene)
   - IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe the first step isn't elimination. Alternative reaction: perhaps it's a substitution. If both bromides undergo substitution with OH groups. But then, 1,3-dihydroxy adamantane would have two OH groups. But the IR would show broad OH stretches around 3200-3600 cm-1, which isn't mentioned, but the given IR is 1720, a sharp peak. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe elimination forms a ketone. But how? Let me think: perhaps if the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, their elimination could form a carbonyl group in between. Wait, but that would require losing two HBr molecules, but does that form a ketone? Let me visualize: suppose we have Br-CH2-CH2-Br. Eliminating two HBr would form CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene. But that's not applicable here. In adamantane, maybe the two adjacent Brs are on a bridge, and elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which is possible but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination to form an alkene, and then oxidation of the alkene to a ketone. But KOH wouldn't oxidize.

Alternatively,
