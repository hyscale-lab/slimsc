Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. Alright, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then there's a reaction sequence with three steps. I need to find the final product from the options.

First, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). 

Let's break this down. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, integrating for 1H. That's quite upfield for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But a triplet... Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic proton in a conjugated system? Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde, but I'm a bit confused.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. Those could be aromatic protons. For example, perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange process, like an -OH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Oh, unless it's a conjugated diene or some other structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton or something like that.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet of 2H. That looks like a methylene group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2 or something.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let me think about the molecular formula C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation can help. For C8H9NO, the formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU). 

The formula is CnHmOxNy: DoU = (2n +2 - m -x -y)/2. So for C8H9NO: n=8, m=9, x=1, y=1. So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18 -11)/2 = 7/2=3.5. Wait, that's not possible. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), y=1 (N). The general formula is DoU = (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. Plugging in, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18 -11)/2 =7/2=3.5. Hmm, fractional degrees of unsaturation? That can't be right. Maybe I miscounted the atoms.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO: let me recount. C:8, H:9, N:1, O:1. So DoU calculation:

DoU = [2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1]/2 = [18 -11]/2 =7/2=3.5. Hmm, that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe it's C8H9NO2? No, the question says C8H9NO. So maybe it's a ring structure. Wait, 3.5 DoU is impossible, so perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate. Oh wait, wait—2n +2 = 18 (n=8), 18 - m=9 is 9, 9 - x=1 is 8, 8 - y=1 is 7. 7/2 is 3.5. Hmm, this suggests maybe the formula is incorrect, but I think I should proceed assuming that perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the molecular formula is correct, and the structure has a ring and a double bond or something else.

Looking back at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton. If that's the case, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's consider that the 9.72 is an aldehyde (RCHO), which is a triplet—so the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group. So maybe it's attached to a CH2 that's next to something else.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2O (like an ether) or maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. If the aldehyde is attached to a CH2, perhaps it's part of a larger structure.

The aromatic peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each. Let me think about para substitution. For example, two para-substituted benzene rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-disubstituted ring, like a benzene ring with two groups in the para positions. Wait, but the integration is 2H each, so maybe two doublets each from two different rings.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps -OH groups, but why 2H? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene? Or perhaps an enol tautomer.

Wait, another possibility: the 9.72 could be an aromatic proton, but that's less likely. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10. Alternatively, it could be a ketone, but that's usually lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 9.72 is an aldehyde proton, and the structure has a benzene ring attached. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Imagine a benzaldehyde group connected to a CH2-O group, which is connected to another benzene ring. For example, perhaps it's a diphenyl compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenone with substituents. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the number of rings and double bonds.

If I consider the NMR, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group (CHO), a benzene ring, and another substituent.

Wait, let me think about the reaction steps. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually for diazotization. Then H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat.

Diazotization is typically done with aromatic amines (like aniline derivatives) to form diazonium salts. Then, when heated with aqueous KOH, diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis. For example, aryl diazonium salts can be hydrolyzed to phenols (if done under specific conditions) or other products depending on the substituents.

Wait, but the starting compound has the formula C8H9NO. Let me think about what the structure could be. The presence of nitro groups? Or maybe an amino group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached. For example, a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde and an amino group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzylamine derivative.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm. Aldehyde protons are usually singlets, but if adjacent to a CH2 group, perhaps the coupling leads to a triplet. For example, if the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 that is adjacent to another CH2, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the reaction steps.

1. NaNO2 and HCl: this is typically for forming a diazonium salt from an aromatic amine. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group (like aniline).

But the NMR doesn't show any NH protons. Wait, but the NMR does show a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm. Alternatively, could the starting compound have an amino group that's been converted into a diazonium salt? Or perhaps the starting structure has an -NH2 group that's been transformed.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a phenyl group substituted with an amino group and a benzaldehyde group.

Alternatively, let me think about the reaction sequence:

Step 1: Diazotization (NaNO2, HCl) forms a diazonium salt.

Step 2: H2O. Wait, sometimes, diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis. In aqueous conditions, diazonium salts can be hydrolyzed, especially when heated. But in this case, step 2 is just
