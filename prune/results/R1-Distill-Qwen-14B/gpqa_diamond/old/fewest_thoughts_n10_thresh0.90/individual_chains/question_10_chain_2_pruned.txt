Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me read the question again.

The question gives four options, a to d. Each describes a planet with certain characteristics. The options are labeled A to D, each pointing to one of the a-d choices. My goal is to determine which of the four (a, b, c, d) has the highest density.

Wait, wait. Wait, the question is a bit tricky. Wait, the options A to D are the answers, each pointing to one of the a to d options. So the actual exoplanet options are the a, b, c, d, and I have to pick which of those has the highest density.

Let me list out each option:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right?

b) 2 Earth masses, density ~5.5 g/cm³. Oh, so mass is double Earth's, but same density.

c) Same composition as Earth, 5x the mass. Hmm, same composition usually implies similar density, right? Because density is mass per volume. If it's more massive but same composition, probably the radius increases, but density remains same or similar. Wait, but let me think. Wait, same composition would mean same average density. Because density is mass/volume, and if the mass scales up, the radius scales up as mass^(1/3) (since volume scales with radius³, and mass with radius³ for same density). So for Earth-like planets, if mass increases, radius increases but density same. So option c has same density as Earth, which is 5.5 g/cm³.

d) Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So again, same density as Earth, 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking which has the highest density. So Earth's density is about 5.5, which is the same as option b. Options c and d are same as Earth, so their densities are 5.5. So the only one with higher or same? Wait, let me go through each.

Option a: Earth's density is 5.5.

Option b: Mass 2 Earth, density 5.5. So same as a. So same density.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, which implies same density. So 5.5. So same as a and d.

Option d: Same composition, so same density. So same as a, c, and b.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question is about which one has the highest density. So all of a, b, c, d have densities around 5.5 except maybe option b. Wait, no, option b says density is 5.5. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the densities for each option.

Let me think. Density is mass divided by volume. Volume is (4/3)πr³. So density = (3M)/(4πr³).

For each option:

a) Earth's mass and radius. So density is 5.5 g/cm³.

b) Mass is 2 Earth masses, density is 5.5. So same as Earth. So same as a.

c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times mass. Since same composition, density same as Earth. So 5.5.

d) Same composition, half mass. So density same as Earth, 5.5.

Wait, but that would mean all options a, b, c, d have the same density. But that can't be right because the question is asking which has the highest.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read again.

Wait, the options a) to d) are the exoplanets, each describing their properties. The actual options are A to D, which pick a to d.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5. So same as a.

Option c: same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth. So 5.5.

Option d: same composition as Earth, half the mass. Same density, 5.5.

So all four have same density? That can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the description for option c is that it's 5 times more massive than Earth but with same composition.

Wait, same composition means same average density. So for a planet with same composition as Earth but 5x the mass, what is its radius? Let's see.

Earth's density is 5.5 g/cm³. So density is mass/(volume). Volume is (4/3)πr³.

So if the planet has same density, its mass is (density) * (volume). So if mass is 5 times Earth's, then volume is 5 times as well. So volume scales with mass if density is same. Since volume is r³, so r scales as cube root of volume. So cube root of 5 is about 1.71, so radius is 1.71 times Earth's radius. But that's not relevant to density here.

So for option c, density is same as Earth: 5.5.

Same for d: same composition, so same density. So all options a, b, c, d have same density. So which is the highest?

Wait, but maybe option b's description is different. Let me read option b again.

Option b: a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, so the density is given as 5.5. So same as Earth. So same as others.

Wait, perhaps option a is Earth's mass and radius, so same as Earth, but what about option b? It's 2 Earth masses, but same density? Then
