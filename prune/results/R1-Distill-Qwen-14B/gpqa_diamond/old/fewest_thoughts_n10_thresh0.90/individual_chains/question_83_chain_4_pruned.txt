Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we have the Ka of acetic acid as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I think I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, I'll figure out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence. From there, I can calculate the pH at each point.

Dilution part first. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So, the new concentration would be (volume1 × concentration1) / volume2. Let me calculate that.

So, volume1 is 20 cm³, concentration1 is 0.05 M. Volume2 is 40 cm³. So (20 * 0.05) / 40 = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. So diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) would produce its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-), and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH initially. Let's find the equivalence point.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.040 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is asking about 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of moles. 25% of the equivalence point would mean 25% of the moles needed. So, 0.001 mol × 0.25 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

Alternatively, the initial moles of acid are 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So, moles reacted = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at that point would be the initial solution plus the added NaOH. So, initial volume before titration is 40 cm³. Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution. So, total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, for the 25% point, we can model this as a buffer solution. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would probably be the easiest way.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let me compute pKa.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

At 25% titration, [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = let's see, 0.00025 / 0.0425. Wait, 0.00025 is 2.5e-4. 0.0425 is 4.25e-2. So 2.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = approximately 0.00588.

Similarly, [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, more accurately, the concentrations are moles divided by total volume. So, [A^-] is 0.00025 / (0.04 + 0.0025) = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.00588 M.

[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

So, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00588)/(0.017647) = approximately 0.3333.

So, log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So, pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256.

That's around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, what about at equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a
