Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that an organic chemist does two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH, followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4, also followed by an acidic workup. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is how many peaks they observe in each case.

Hmm, okay. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used for reducing esters, ketones, etc. Similarly, NaBH4 is a milder reagent, typically for aldehydes and ketones, but maybe not as strong as LAH. Wait, but sometimes NaBH4 can reduce other things under certain conditions, like if the carbonyl is activated.

Let me break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. So, the structure is a ketone. LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) would reduce the ketone. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3, but with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon. So the structure would be: CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. 3-ketone in hexane would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexane has six carbons. So, positions 1 to 6. Hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one: the ketone is on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons, but hexan implies six. Oh wait, wait. The correct structure is CH2CH2
