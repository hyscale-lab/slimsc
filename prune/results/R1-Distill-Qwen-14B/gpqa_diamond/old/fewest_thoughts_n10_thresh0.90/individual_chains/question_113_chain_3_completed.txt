--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this problem about identifying a chemical formula based on various spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can figure out.

The compound's formula is among four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Starting with the FTIR: a very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups, maybe from a carboxylic acid, alcohol, or phenol. The broad peak often indicates hydrogen bonding, which is common in these groups.

There are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone or an ester. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's in the options here.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, maybe as part of a ring or a substituent.

Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is the mass for (CH3)CO, which is a common fragment in esters. For example, in ester cleavage, you might get a (CH3)CO+ ion. So maybe the compound is an ester.

Putting this together, let's think about the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. The degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=6, H=12, O=2. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So one degree of unsaturation. But wait, let me double-check: if the formula is C6H12O2, the degrees would be (2*6 +2 -12 +0)/2? No, wait, O doesn't count. So yeah, same as before, 14-12=2, divided by 2 is 1. But wait, wait, I think the formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Oh wait, X is halogens, which are zero here. So 2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0 =14-12=2, divided by 2 is 1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So that would account for one degree (the double bond), but if there's a ring, that would be another. Hmm. Wait, maybe more.

Wait, option C is C6H10O2. Let's compute degrees of unsaturation for that. (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)=4, so 4/2= 2 degrees. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two rings, or two double bonds. Since the NMR shows vinyl H, it's a double bond. So maybe a ring (like benzene) plus a double bond? Or a ring and an ester group.

Wait, but another angle. The IR has a strong peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a carbonyl, perhaps from an ester. If the compound is an ester, it would have the structure R-O-CO-R. Esters have strong carbonyl peaks around 1700-1750 cm^-1. The 1650 peak might be from conjugation, like in an aromatic ring or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but if the compound is an ester, the formula would have two oxygen atoms. Looking at the options, both A and C have two oxygen atoms. A is C6H12O2, C is C6H10O2.

So if it's an ester, the formula would have O2. So options A and C.

Now, the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45 is (CH3CO)+, which is 45. So if the compound is an ester, perhaps it's methyl something or ethyl, but wait, let's think.

Suppose the ester is, for example, methyl something. The ester group is O-CO-O-R. The cleavage could give a fragment where the carbonyl is part of a fragment. For example, in an ester like methyl propionate, upon cleavage, you get a fragment with methyl carbonyl.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C6H10O2 or C6H12O2. Let's see.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol. If the fragment is 45, that's about a third of the molecule. So maybe it's a smaller fragment.

Alternatively, let me think about possible structures. Let's consider that the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But then the IR would show a different pattern.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. That means the compound has a double bond. So the structure probably has an alkene, which adds another degree of unsaturation.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option D is C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. Since the NMR shows vinyl H, it's a double bond. So that's one degree. But the IR has a broad peak, perhaps from an alcohol or something else. However, the presence of a carbonyl would require an O. So D has only one O. So the carbonyl may be from a ketone or aldehyde. But an aldehyde would have a strong peak around 2800-2700 in the IR, which isn't mentioned. So perhaps a ketone. But where would the O-H broad peak come from? Maybe it's an enol, but I'm not sure.

Options A and C are more likely because they have two oxygen atoms, possibly an ester group.

So let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1. One double bond or ring. But the NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond. So one double bond. But that leaves the other degree from where? Wait, no, the calculation: (2*6+2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So only one degree. That could be a double bond plus maybe a ring? No, because that would be two degrees. Unless I'm miscalculating—wait, maybe the formula has a ring and a double bond, which would be two degrees. So that would require a formula with two degrees. Let's check C6H12O2. (2*6 +2 -12)=14-12=2, so 2/2=1. So only one degree. So how can that have a double bond and a ring? That would require two degrees, which would imply a formula with two degrees. So perhaps option A is not correct because it can't have both a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So that could be one ring and one double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds. Since the NMR has vinyl H, which is a double bond, so that accounts for one. The other could be a ring.

So if the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an aromatic ring? No, because benzene is 3 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alkene. For example, methyl acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let me check the formula for that: C4H6O2. But our options are C6H10O2. So perhaps a substituted version.

Wait, another thought: the ester could be something like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. Let's see, the formula would be C7H10O2. But our options are C6H10O2, so maybe a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the mass spec has a peak at m/z 45. What's the molecular weight of the parent? Let me see the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight: (6×12) +12 + (2×16)=72 +12 +32=116.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

The fragment at 45 is about 40% of 114, but 45 is a common fragment for a smaller molecule. Wait, 45 corresponds to (CH3CO)+, which could be from a cleavage of an ester. For example, in an ester like ethyl propanoate, the cleavage could give a fragment with the acetyl group (43, but wait, 43 is CH3CO+, but 45 is like (CH3)COOH? No, wait, molecular weight of (CH3CO+) is 43. Hmm, but the fragment is 45. That's 45. Let me compute: 45 is 45 g/mol. The possible formula for that is C3H6O2? No, wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3COOH+? No, because that would be 60. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH3CO)O, but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe the fragment is (CH2CH3)O-CO, which would be 45? Let me see: CH2CH3 is 29, CO is 28, total 57. No, that's not right. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an acetate group breaking off. An acetate group is OAc, which is (CH3COO-). The mass would be 60 for the group, but perhaps a fragment could lose some parts. I'm not entirely sure about this.

Another approach: the molecular formula is either C6H10O2 or C6H12O2. Let's consider the possible structures.

If the compound has an ester group and a double bond, for example, let's say it's an ester where the R group has a double bond. So something like CH2=CHCOOR. Let's check the formula for that. Suppose R is methyl: CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula would be C4H6O2. But our options are C6H10O2 or C6H12O2. So perhaps it's a larger ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclohexene derivative with an ester group. Let's imagine something like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. The formula for cyclohexene is C6H10, and the ester would be O-CO-OCH3. Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10, so adding the ester group (O-CO-OCH3) would add 2 O and 2 C (since the ester is R-O-CO-O-R'), but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, another approach: the presence of a broad O-H peak in IR suggests either an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad around 2500-3300 cm^-1, which matches the 3000 peak here. But carboxylic acids have a peak around 1700 cm^-1. So that fits. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

But then the NMR would show a broad peak for the O-H. But the question says several peaks, including vinyl H. So perhaps the O-H is from a phenol? But phenols have a broad peak too, but in the NMR, the O-H proton is usually a singlet and broad, but the question doesn't mention that, only that there are peaks including vinyl H.

Wait, but the question mentions the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. So that's the O-H. Now, for a carboxylic acid, the O-H is a very broad peak, maybe even a strong absorption. But if the compound is an ester, the O-H would be from something else, like an alcohol. Wait, but esters don't have O-H groups unless it's an alcohol as a part of the ester. Hmm, unless the compound is an acid anhydride, but that's less likely here.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an alcohol, but then the 1700 peak would be from something else, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but if the compound is an ester, it wouldn't have an O-H unless there's another functional group. So maybe a diester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which doesn't have free O-H groups, but that might not explain the broad peak.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's think again about the options.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So could be a ring (like cyclohexene) and a double bond, but wait, cyclohexene already has a double bond. Hmm, maybe one ring and one double bond, but that would be two degrees. Alternatively, two rings, which is less likely.

Option A is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So perhaps one ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond. So that would account for one degree. Then, where's the other? Hmm, perhaps a carbonyl group (the 1700 peak) would be another degree. Wait, a carbonyl is a double bond (C=O), so that's another degree. But then, for option A, which has a degree of 1, that's impossible because the double bond (from the vinyl H) and the carbonyl (from 1700) would account for two degrees. So option A can't have both, because that would require two degrees of unsaturation, but option A only has one. So option A is not possible.

Wait, that's a key point. Let's elaborate.

Degrees of unsaturation calculation:

Each degree is one ring or one double bond or one triple bond.

So, for option A: C6H12O2.

(2*6 +2 -12 )/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

If the compound has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (from the 1700 peak), that's two degrees. So option A can't have both. Therefore, option A is invalid.

Similarly, option D is C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation is (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. If there's a double bond (vinyl H) and a carbonyl (1700), that's two degrees, which is impossible for option D. So option D is out.

That leaves options B and C. Let's look at option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So either two double bonds, a double bond and a ring, or two rings.

But the IR has a carbonyl peak, which is a double bond. So one degree from the carbonyl, and another from the vinyl H. So two degrees, which fits option B's degrees of 2. But what about the O in the formula? Option B has one O. So the carbonyl would be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. But if it's a ketone, the O is accounted for. But then where is the broad peak at 3000? If it's a ketone, the O-H would have to come from somewhere else, like an alcohol group. But option B has only one O, so if it's a ketone, the O is used up, so no O-H group. That would not explain the broad peak at 3000 in IR. Therefore, option B is unlikely.

So the only remaining option is option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. That's one for the carbonyl (C=O), one for the vinyl (C=C). So that works.

Now, what about the mass spec? The fragment at m/z 45.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the parent ion is 114 (6*12=72 +10 +32=114). The fragment at 45 is 45/114 ≈ 39% of the parent. That suggests it's a major fragment.

So what would break off from the molecule to give 45? Let's think of possible structures.

If the molecule is an ester with a structure where the acetyl group (CH3COO-) is part of it. The fragment could be (CH3COO), which would have a mass of 59. That's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a different fragment.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester with a propenyl group. Let me think: for example, methyl vinyl benzoate. Wait, the formula for that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted acrylic acid ester. Let's consider the structure:

Suppose it's something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group. For the formula to be C6H10O2, the ester would have R as a methyl group, but let's count:

CH2=CHCOOCH3 would be C4H6O2. But our compound is C6H10O2, which has two more carbons and four more hydrogens. So maybe the R is ethyl? No, that would give C5... Hmm, maybe the R is a cyclopropyl group? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group. But benzene is C6H6, and adding an ester group would require O, but I'm not sure. Also, the vinyl H suggests a double bond outside the ring, perhaps?

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a diester. For example, something like diethyl maleate. The formula would be C8H12O4, which doesn't match any of our options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the fragment again. m/z 45. What's another possibility besides (CH3CO)+? Maybe (CH2CH2CO)+? Wait, 45 would be C3H6O. Let me see: 3 carbons (3*12=36) + 6 hydrogens (6) + 16 O = 36+6+16=58. Wait, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe it's (CH3)COH+. No, that would be 45? CH3COH has a molecular weight of 45. (CH3)COH is 12*3 (3 CH3) + 2 O (32) + H (1) → wait, no: (CH3)COH is actually acetol, which is (CH3)COH: molecular formula C2H4O2. Wait, no: (CH3)COH is C2H4O, but that's a different story.

Alternatively, if the fragment is (CH3)CO-O-R, but that's the ester group, which would be larger.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)CO+ which would be 43 (12*2 +16 +1*2 = 24+16+2=42? Wait, not quite. 12*2=24, CO is 12+16=28. So (CH2)CO is 24 +28 =52, no. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. What's the possible structure that would give a fragment of 45 upon cleavage.

Maybe the molecule is a diethyl acetyl something, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a bicyclic structure. Not sure.

Alternatively, think of the possible structures for C6H10O2 that have both a carbonyl and a double bond.

One possibility is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is a methyl group, but that would give C4H6O2. Not matching.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a cyclic ester. For example, a five-membered ring, like gamma-butyrolactone. But gamma-butyrolactone is C4H6O2. So adding more carbons would require a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester derived from a cyclohexene carboxylic acid. Let's see: cyclohexene is C6H10. If the compound is the methyl ester of cyclohexene carboxylic acid, that would be C7H12O2. But our formula is C6H10O2. Hmm, not matching.

Another possibility is that the molecule is a substituted ester with a double bond. For example, maybe something like CH2=CH-OOC-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is methyl vinyl benzoate. Benzoate ester would have the formula C8H8O2, which is more than our options.

This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should focus back on the mass spec. The fragment is 45. Let me think of what 45 could be.

45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see what possible structures have a mass of 45.

Possible options:

- CH3COOH: molecular weight is 60 (12*2 + 1*4 +16*2 = 24+4+32=60). No, that's too big.

- CH3COO- (acetate ion): molecular weight is 59. No.

- CH2CH2CO: that's 45? Let me calculate: CH2CH2CO is C3H6O. Molecular weight is (3×12)+(6×1)+(16) =36 +6 +16=58. No.

Wait, maybe it's a different group. What about (CH2)2CO? That's C3H6O. Wait, that's 58 again. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CH2CO group? No, that's 58.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2COH. What's the formula? (CH3)2COH is C3H8O. Molecular weight is 3*12 +8 +16=36+8+16=60. No.

Hmm, another approach: 45 is the m/z of a fragment. Maybe it's the acetyl group (CH3CO) plus some hydrogen? Let's see: CH3CO+ is 43. But the fragment is 45. Then, perhaps it's CH2COOH+ which would be 45? Wait, CH2COOH is 45? Let's see: C=12, H=1, O=16. So CH2COOH is C2H4O2. Molecular weight is (2×12) +4 + (2×16)=24 +4 +32=60. No, that's not right.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is (CH3)COO-, which is 59. No, but our fragment is 45.

Wait, perhaps it's ethyl acetate losing a fragment. Ethyl acetate is C4H8O2. If it breaks to give the acetate group, that's 88 (C4H8O2) but that's more than 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration product.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene. A ketene is O=C=O, but its mass is 44 (O2C= 16*2 +12 =44). So 44. But the fragment is at 45, so perhaps CH3C=O+ with a hydrogen. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps it's the (CH3CO) group, which is 43, but the fragment is 45. Maybe it's CH3CO with an additional H somewhere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH2=CH). No, that's 28.

Hmm, I'm stuck on the mass spec part. But moving on, considering that the IR shows a strong peak at 1700 and 1650, which suggests a conjugated carbonyl group. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is a methyl group. Let's check the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH3 is C4H6O2. So that's not matching any of the options except perhaps option C, which is C6H10O2. So maybe the R group is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex. Maybe the compound is a bicyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a conjugated carbonyl would fit with the NMR showing vinyl H. Because the double bond is next to the carbonyl, so in the NMR, the vinyl H's would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But how does that tie into the options?

If the structure is CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is a larger group, perhaps with a ring.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a substituted ester of a dienoic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COO-R.

Hmm, but I'm not getting closer to the answer. Maybe I should just conclude based on the other data points.

So, the FTIR suggests O-H, carbonyl, and possibly conjugated carbonyl. The NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond. The mass spec has a fragment at 45, which I think relates to a part of the ester group.

Putting it all together, the compound is likely a diester or an ester with a conjugated double bond. The formula must have two oxygen atoms, so options A and C.

Earlier, we saw that option A (C6H12O2) can't have both a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (from 1700) because that would require two degrees of unsaturation, but option A only has one. So option C is the only possibility.

So the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid, alcohol, or phenol. Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly conjugated. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond in the structure. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is characteristic of the (CH₃CO)⁺ ion, commonly observed in esters.

To determine the correct formula, the degrees of unsaturation are calculated for each option:

- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂):** Degrees of unsaturation = (2(6) + 2 - 12)/2 = 1. This suggests one double bond or one ring. However, the presence of both a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and a double bond (from vinyl hydrogens) requires two degrees of unsaturation, making this option invalid.

- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O):** Degrees of unsaturation = (2(6) + 2 - 10)/2 = 2. This could accommodate one double bond and one ring or two double bonds. However, the compound must contain two oxygen atoms (from the IR and mass spectrometry data), which this option lacks. Thus, this option is also invalid.

- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):** Degrees of unsaturation = (2(6) + 2 - 10)/2 = 2. This allows for one double bond and one ring or two double bonds. The IR data (broad O-H peak and conjugated carbonyl) and the ¹H NMR data (vinyl hydrogens) are consistent with this structure. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 aligns with an ester functional group, supporting this option.

- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O):** Degrees of unsaturation = (2(6) + 2 - 12)/2 = 1. Similar to Option A, this cannot account for both a carbonyl group and a double bond, making it invalid.

The compound must have two oxygen atoms (from the IR and mass spectrometry data) and accommodate both a carbonyl group and a double bond. This is consistent with Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂), which has two degrees of unsaturation and matches the spectroscopic data. The fragment at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum further supports the presence of an ester group.

**Answer: C**
