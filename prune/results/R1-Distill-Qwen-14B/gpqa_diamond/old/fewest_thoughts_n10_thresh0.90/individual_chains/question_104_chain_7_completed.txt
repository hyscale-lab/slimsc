Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected using the RV method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

So, each star is moving a bit because of the planet. The shift in the spectral lines is what tells us about the planet's presence. The problem gives the shifts for each planet: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, but wait. I remember that the RV method depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the Doppler shift (or the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity) is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (4π²/P²) )^(1/3) )

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is less than the Sun, so M_star >> M_p), the formula simplifies. I think the relevant formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Alternatively, I remember another way: the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ), but maybe I'm getting the exponents wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²)) ) )

But wait, the problem states that both orbits are circular, so e=0. So the sqrt(1-e²) becomes 1. So K simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1) )) )

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the dependence. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)) ), assuming M_star is the same for both, which it is (both stars have same mass as Sun). Because M_p is same for both planets (both similar to Neptune), so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, no. Wait, the formula I have is K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) P^(1/3) ) )

But again, e=0, so it simplifies to K ∝ (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_star are same for both planets (same as each other and same as Sun), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, that can't be right because if K is higher, then P would be smaller? Hmm, let's see.

Because K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity. So if K is larger, that implies a higher velocity, which would mean a shorter period because the star has to move back and forth more quickly. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, think of K as the velocity semi-amplitude. So a higher K would mean a larger velocity, which could come from a more massive planet or a shorter orbital period.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula correctly. Let me get the correct expression.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3)

Wait, I think I'm getting this confused. Let me look up the formula again mentally.

The formula is: K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) * P ) )^(1/3)

Wait, I think I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, I recall another version where K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of how K scales with P. Let me imagine that M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, which they are. So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So if K_planet2 / K_planet1 = (P_planet1 / P_planet2)^(1/3)

Wait, because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

But the given K values are 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet 1 and 2. Wait no, actually, the shifts are 5 and 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

Wait no, the problem says 'the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 milliangstroms'. So K1 =5, K2=7.

Wait, but let me be precise. So K is the semi-amplitude, which is the maximum shift. So higher K means more shift. So planet 2 has a higher K than planet 1.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a higher K implies a smaller P. So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1. So the orbital period of planet 2 is shorter than that of planet 1.

But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet 2 than planet 1. So if P2 is shorter, then it's less than 1 times. So the ratio P2/P1 would be less than 1, which would mean that planet 2 has a shorter period.

Wait, but let's do the math.

We have K proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Because K1 = (some constant) * (1/P1^(1/3)), K2 = same constant * (1/P2^(1/3))

So K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So rearranged: (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Then, (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3

Compute 5/7: approximately 0.714. 0.714^3 is about 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Which means P2 is about 0.364 times the period of P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of about 0.364.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since 0.364 is less than 1, that would mean P2 is not longer, but shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, so P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter, which makes sense because higher K implies shorter period.

But wait, the question is phrased: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So the question is asking P2 / P1. Since P2 is less than P1, the ratio is less than 1. So it's about 0.36 times. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's make sure I didn't get the ratio backwards.

Wait, the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1?

Which is P2 / P1. So if P2 is 0.36 of P1, that ratio is 0.36, which is about 0.36 times as long. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So it's shorter than planet #1.

So the answer would be option A) ~0.36.

But let me double-check the math.

We have K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1. 5^3=125, 7^3=343. 125/343 is approximately 0.364.

Yes, that's correct. So P2 is 0.364 times P1, meaning it's shorter. So the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star. The semi-amplitude \( K \) of the radial velocity is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have masses similar to Neptune, the relationship simplifies to \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \).

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \). Using the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), we have:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Rearranging for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \), we get:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3.
\]

Calculating \( \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 \), we find:

\[
\left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This means planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's, and the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is approximately 0.36.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
