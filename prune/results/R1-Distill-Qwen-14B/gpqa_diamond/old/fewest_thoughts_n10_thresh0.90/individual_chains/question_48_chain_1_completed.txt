--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. The main goal is to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Alright, let's break down each step.

First step: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When ketones react with bromine, I remember that it's a type of addition reaction. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, so bromine could add across the carbonyl. Wait, but wait, what's the exact reaction?

Wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. Adding bromine... Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, and adding bromine (Br2) without any other conditions. Oh, I think in such cases, the carbonyl group is attacked. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via enolate formation, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, another possibility: I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's a bromohydrination if water is present, but here it's just bromine. Alternatively, maybe it's a diaddition. Wait, no, wait, cyclohexanone with bromine in a different solvent. Oh, wait, maybe it's the Prins reaction or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexanone undergoing bromination via a different pathway.

Wait, wait, what if bromine adds across the carbonyl group? So the ketone would have the carbonyl O and a C=O. Adding Br2 could lead to a bromohydrin, but without a proton source, maybe it's a different addition. Alternatively, maybe it's an electrophilic addition where each Br adds to each carbon of the carbonyl. Wait, wait, but I think that in the presence of a base, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Cyclohexanone and Br2. Another thought: When aldehydes or ketones react with bromine in a dihydroxy medium, they form a bromohydrin. Without any other reagents, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diaddition across the carbonyl, leading to a dibromide. Wait, but cyclohexanone's carbonyl is more reactive than alkanes, so maybe Br2 adds to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,2-addition. So the Br could add to the carbonyl carbon and the other Br to the oxygen? No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone undergoing a bromination via the enol mechanism, but that's more for aromatic compounds. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the reaction is the addition of bromine to the cyclohexane ring. Oh, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl, which is a good deactivating group. So bromine would add to the ring? But cyclohexanone is a ketone, which is meta-directing. Wait, but bromination of cyclohexanone would require a Lewis acid catalyst, like FeBr3, right? But the question says it's treated with bromine, without any other reagents mentioned. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a bromocyclohexanone. So cyclohexanone adds Br2 to the ring, but wait, without any Lewis acid, that might not happen. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh! Wait, I think I remember that ketones can undergo a reaction called the benzoin condensation with Br2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a di bromo compound via the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl. So cyclohexanone (O=C-R) would add Br across the carbonyl, making a geminal dibromide. So product 1 would be 1,1-dibromocyclohexane, or something like that.

Wait, no, the product would be 1,1-dibromocyclohexane? Because adding two Br atoms to the same carbon. Wait, that would make a vicinal dihalide, but wait, no, for a ketone, adding Br2 would lead to a 1,2-dihydroxybromide or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2-dibromide.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Cyclohexanone is (cyclohexyl)ketone: 

O
||
C-R (where R is cyclohexyl).

When Br2 adds across the carbonyl, it would form a vicinal dibromide. So, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes C-Br-O-Br? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, maybe each Br adds to the carbonyl carbon and oxygen? Or maybe the C=O becomes CBr-OBr? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2-dibromide where the carbonyl becomes Br-C-O-Br, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps it's a more straightforward addition: the Br2 adds across the double bond of the carbonyl. So, the C=O becomes C-Br-O-Br? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps instead, the carbonyl becomes a single bond with Br on each side. So, the carbonyl O would have two Brs attached? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this first step. Maybe I should move on and see if the subsequent steps can give me any clues.

Second step: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. Sodium hydroxide, NaOH, is a strong base. So perhaps product 1 is a dibromide, and the base would cause elimination or substitution.

Wait, if product 1 is a dibromide, then treating with NaOH could lead to an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. Alternatively, if product 1 is a vicinal dihalide, like 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, then heating with NaOH would cause elimination via an E2 mechanism, forming cyclohexene as product 2.

Wait, that makes sense. So if product 1 is a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, then treatment with NaOH would cause elimination of HBr from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. But would this be the case?

Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone treated with Br2 giving a di-bromide. So cyclohexanone (which is a ketone) reacts with Br2 to form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Then, when heated with NaOH, elimination occurs to form cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1-bromo-cyclohexanol? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a bromide via the keto-enol tautomer. Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but let's proceed under the assumption that product 2 is cyclohexene.

Third step: Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, or alcohols to chlorides. But product 2 is cyclohexene, which is an alkene. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So if product 2 is cyclohexene, then treating with SOCl2 wouldn't do much. Hmm, that suggests that my earlier assumption about product 2 might be incorrect.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a different compound. Let me think again. If the first step is cyclohexanone + Br2, perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a bromination of the cyclohexanone ring, adding a Br substituent. But where?

Wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone can undergo a reaction with Br2 to form a bromocyclohexanone. But without a Lewis acid catalyst, the bromine might not add to the ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a radical bromination, but that's usually done under different conditions.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a cyclohexane diol bromide or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about the overall process. The starting material is cyclohexanone, which is treated with Br2, then NaOH, then SOCl2, and so on.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider each step in the reaction pathway.

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assuming product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

2. Product 1 + NaOH → product 2. Heating with NaOH likely leads to elimination, so product 2 would be cyclohexene.

3. Product 2 (cyclohexene) + SOCl2 → product 3. Wait, but cyclohexene is an alkene. Thionyl chloride typically reacts with alcohols, amines, or carboxylic acids. But cyclohexene is an alkene, which doesn't react with SOCl2 under normal conditions. So maybe product 2 isn't cyclohexene. Hmm, that suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, so perhaps product 1 isn't a vicinal dihalide. Let me think again.

Alternative approach for the first step: If cyclohexanone is treated with excess bromine, perhaps the reaction is a bromination on the ring. Since cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which is a meta-directing group, the bromine would add to the ring in the meta position. But without a Lewis acid, that might not happen. So perhaps that's not the first step either.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a conjugate addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, leading to a bromoalkane. For example, adding Br across the carbonyl to form a secondary bromide. So cyclohexanone (R2C=O) becomes R2CBr-OH, but that would require more specific conditions.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the first step is the formation of a bromohydrin. When a ketone reacts with Br2 in the presence of water, it forms a bromohydrin. So, the product would be a secondary alcohol with a Br substituent. But the question doesn't mention water, so perhaps it's just Br2 in another solvent, leading to a different product.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a nucleophilic attack. Wait, but ketones are electrophilic, so maybe Br- could attack the carbonyl. Wait, but Br2 is a diatomic molecule, perhaps acting as an electrophile.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the overall process.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. The first step is adding Br2, which I think leads to the formation of a di-substituted bromide across the carbonyl. So cyclohexanone (O=C-R) becomes R-CBr2, where R is cyclohexyl. So product 1 is 1,1-dibromocyclohexane? Or perhaps 1,2-dibromocyclohexane?

Wait, maybe it's 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Because adding Br2 across the carbonyl would give a vicinal dihalide. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Then, when product 1 is heated with NaOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate HBr from the adjacent Br atoms, forming cyclohexene (product 2).

Wait, but then product 3 is the reaction of cyclohexene with SOCl2. That doesn't make sense, because cyclohexene isn't reacting with SOCl2. So that suggests that product 2 must be wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a bromide of a secondary alcohol.

Wait, let's think again. Cyclohexanone + Br2 could form a bromohydrin, but without water, perhaps it's just a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha bromination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction is a diels-alder type reaction, but that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a ring-opening. No, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone, which isn't easily opened by Br2.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that would require specific conditions and typically uses peracids. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the other steps. Product 3 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Then product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Hmm, LiAlH is a strong reducing agent. It's typically used to reduce esters, acid chlorides, etc., to alcohols.

Wait, so LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a bulky reducing agent, so perhaps product 3 is an acid chloride. Because when you have an acid chloride, treatment with LiAlH would reduce it to the corresponding alcohol.

So, let me think backwards. If product 4 is formed by the reduction of product 3, which is an acid chloride, then product 4 would be an alcohol.

But wait, product 3 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Typically, thionyl chloride converts alcohols to chlorides, or ketones to chlorides. Wait, but if product 2 is a ketone, then product 3 would be a chloride.

Wait, let me try to model this.

Product 1: ?

Product 2: ?

Product 3: ?

Product 4: ?

So step 1: cyclohexanone → product 1 (with Br2).

Step 2: product 1 → product 2 (heated with NaOH).

Step 3: product 2 → product 3 (treated with SOCl2 and pyridine).

Step 4: product 3 → product 4 (treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3).

Assuming product 4 is an alcohol, then product 3 must be a carbonyl group, such as a ketone or aldehyde. Because LiAlH would reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol.

Wait, but product 3 is formed from product 2 by treatment with SOCl2 and pyridine. So what reacts with SOCl2 to form a carbonyl group?

Wait, no, wait. SOCl2 reacts with alcohols to form alkyl chlorides and SO2 and HCl. Alternatively, it reacts with carboxylic acids to form acid chlorides. But if product 2 is, say, a ketone, then SOCl2 wouldn't react with it. Wait, but if product 2 is an alcohol, then SOCl2 would convert it to an alkyl chloride.

Wait, but then product 3 would be an alkyl chloride. Then, when product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, it would reduce the alkyl chloride. But LiAlH typically doesn't reduce alkyl chlorides unless under specific conditions. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe each step is as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone reacts with Br2 to form a bromide. Let's say it's 1-bromo-cyclohexanone.

Wait, no, that's not possible because Br2 would add across the carbonyl, not substitute. So that would give a different product.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a bromoalkane via the acid-catalyzed addition of HBr. But again, no acid is mentioned.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, making a dibromide. So, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes CBr-OBr? Or perhaps CBr2-O? I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diaddition, making a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the overall process converts the ketone into an alcohol, but via several steps.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the first step is the formation of a cyclohexanol bromide. But without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the overall process leading to product 4 and see what that might be.

Assuming the last step is a reduction with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. Since this is a bulky reducing agent, it's often used for ketones to form secondary alcohols, but in some cases, it can reduce esters or acid chlorides. So, if product 3 is an acid chloride, then product 4 would be a primary alcohol.

Wait, let me think. If product 3 is an acid chloride, then product 4 would be a primary alcohol. Because acid chlorides reduce to primary alcohols. So, starting from an acid chloride, LiAlH would add two equivalents of hydride: the carbonyl becomes CH2-O-, and then the chloride leaves, giving an alcohol.

So, if product 4 is a primary alcohol, then product 3 must be an acid chloride corresponding to that alcohol.

So, product 3 is an acid chloride. Then, product 2 must be a carboxylic acid, because thionyl chloride converts carboxylic acids into acid chlorides.

Wait, but product 2 is the result of heating product 1 with NaOH. So if product 2 is a carboxylic acid, then product 1 must be a bromide that upon treatment with NaOH gives a carboxylic acid. That doesn't seem right because NaOH would hydrolyze a bromide to an alcohol, not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a ketone, which upon treatment with SOCl2 would become an acid chloride. But that doesn't make sense because SOCl2 reacts with alcohols and carboxylic acids, not ketones. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a primary alcohol. Then, when treated with SOCl2, it would become a primary chloride.

Wait, but then product 3 is a primary chloride, and when treated with LiAlH, it would reduce the chloride. Hmm, I think LiAlH doesn't reduce alkyl chlorides. So that approach might not work.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a ketone. Then, treating with SOCl2 wouldn't change it. So perhaps that's not the case either.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to write down all the steps and see what makes sense.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assume product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: product 1 + NaOH → product 2 (cyclohexene via elimination).

Step 3: product 2 (cyclohexene) + SOCl2 → product 3? But cyclohexene doesn't react with SOCl2. So this can't be right. So my assumption about product 1 is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Perhaps product 1 is cyclohexanol bromide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe in step 1, Br2 adds to the carbonyl group, making a bromide ester. Wait, but I'm not familiar with that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl, making a di-bromide, but then in step 2, NaOH would hydrolyze this to a diol. Wait, but if product 1 is a vicinal di-bromide, then NaOH would cause elimination to form a double bond (product 2 is cyclohexene). Then, product 3 would involve treating cyclohexene with SOCl2, which I don't think reacts with alkenes. So that can't be.

Another possibility: Perhaps the first step is a substitution, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall process. The final product, product 4, is formed after treatment with LiAlH(t-Bu)3. What types of compounds does this reagent reduce?

LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, amides, acid chlorides, and ketones. It may not reduce alkenes or alkanes.

So, if product 3 is an acid chloride, then product 4 would be a primary alcohol. Let's imagine that.

So, product 4 is a primary alcohol. So, how many distinct hydrogens would that have?

Wait, but let's get back to the steps.

If product 3 is an acid chloride, then product 2 must be a carboxylic acid. Because thionyl chloride converts carboxylic acids to acid chlorides.

So product 2 is a carboxylic acid. Then, product 1 must be a bromide that upon treatment with NaOH (step 2) gives a carboxylic acid. But that would require that product 1 is a bromide adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps a benzyl bromide-like situation, but in a cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is bromocyclohexanone. Then, when treated with NaOH, it undergoes hydrolysis to form cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (product 2).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because cyclohexanone is R-C=O, adding Br in a way that would allow hydrolysis to form R-COOH.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 2-bromo-cyclohexanone. Then, when treated with NaOH, it would undergo elimination to form a double bond, not hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal dibromide, like 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Then, treatment with NaOH would lead to elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming cyclohexanone again. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a bromide at an alpha position, such as cyclohexyl methyl bromide. Then, treatment with NaOH would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but how would cyclohexanone react with Br2 to form such a compound?

Hmm, perhaps the first step is the addition of Br2 to the cyclohexanone's alpha position. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a benzyl-type bromide. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a benzyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution, but I don't recall such a reaction for ketones with Br2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the first step is a simple addition of Br2 across the carbonyl, making a di-bromide. Then, step 2 is elimination to form a double bond. Then, step 3 is adding something else. Wait, but that didn't make sense earlier.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is cyclohexanol. Because if product 1 is a di-bromide, and step 2 is hydrolysis with NaOH, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, but that would require a good leaving group.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each product's structure.

Product 4 is the end result. Let's say product 4 is a primary alcohol. Then, product 3 would be an acid chloride. Product 2 would be a carboxylic acid, and product 1 would be a bromide that when treated with NaOH gives a carboxylic acid.

Wait, so product 2 is a carboxylic acid. So product 1 must be the corresponding bromide. How can cyclohexanone react with Br2 to form such a bromide?

Wait, perhaps the first step is the bromination of the alpha position. So, cyclohexanone's alpha carbon is brominated. But I'm not sure how that would happen with Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a bromide at the alpha position. For example, cyclohexanone's alpha carbon (the CH2 next to the carbonyl) could get a Br, making a structure like CH2Br-CO-cyclohexane.

But how would that happen with Br2?

Hmm, perhaps it's an enol bromination. Wait, in the presence of a base, ketones can form enolates, which can then react with electrophiles like Br2. But the question doesn't mention any base in the first step, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a radical bromination at the alpha position. But that usually requires light and a bromine source, which the question doesn't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by Br, but that's not feasible because the carbonyl is a double bond.

Wait, maybe the first step is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, making a bromide ester, but I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the first step is an addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, making a dibromide, then elimination to form a double bond, and then further reactions.

Wait, let's try again, assuming product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: Product 1 (1,2-dibromocyclohexane) heated with NaOH. This would cause elimination of two HBr molecules, forming cyclohexene (product 2).

Step 3: Product 2 (cyclohexene) treated with SOCl2 and pyridine. Hmm, but cyclohexene is an alkene; I don't think it reacts with SOCl2 under normal conditions. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is something else. Suppose product 1 is a bromide at a position adjacent to the carbonyl, like 2-bromo-cyclohexanone.

Then, step 2: treatment with NaOH. Perhaps it's a SN2 substitution, but in a cyclic structure, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's elimination, forming a ketone and HBr. But that would just give back cyclohexanone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal dibromide, like 2,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Then, treatment with NaOH could eliminate two Br and form a double bond, giving cyclohexene.

But then again, step 3 would involve treating cyclohexene with SOCl2, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a bromohydrin formation. So cyclohexanone + Br2 in presence of water gives a bromohydrin, but since the question doesn't mention water, perhaps it's another solvent.

Wait, another thought: When a ketone reacts with excess Br2 in a solvent like CCl4, it can form a 1,2-dibromide via addition across the carbonyl. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Then, product 2 is formed by eliminating two HBr molecules to form cyclohexene.

Product 3: cyclohexene treated with SOCl2. But I don't think SOCl2 reacts with alkenes. So that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction of alkenes with SOCl2. Wait, I don't recall any specific reaction between alkenes and thionyl chloride. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Maybe the product 2 is not an alkene but something else. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a different reaction. Let's think about the possibility that product 1 is cyclohexyl bromide, but I don't see how cyclohexanone would form that with Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a ring-opening. But cyclohexanone isn't easily opened by Br2 without a catalyst.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a cyclohexane diol bromide. But without more info, it's hard to say.

At this point, perhaps I should give up and think about what product 4 would be, given the options.

If product 4 has 7 distinct H atoms, then the answer is D)7.

But wait, let's think about possible structures.

Suppose product 4 is a cyclohexane derivative with a substituent that makes several equivalent hydrogens. For example, if product 4 is a cyclohexanol derivative with a substituent in a certain position, the number of distinct H's would vary.

Wait, let's try to think of each step again.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Assume product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH → product 2 (cyclohexene).

Step 3: Product 2 (cyclohexene) + SOCl2 → product 3. Hmm, but as before, this doesn't make sense. So perhaps product 2 isn't cyclohexene.

Alternative approach: Maybe product 1 is a secondary bromide, and product 2 is a secondary alcohol. Then, product 3 would be an acid chloride, and product 4 would be a primary alcohol.

Wait, let's try that.

Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Product 2: When treated with NaOH, perhaps undergoes hydrolysis to form 2-hydroxycyclohexanone (a secondary alcohol).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because I don't think 2-bromocyclohexanone would hydrolyze under basic conditions to form an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary bromide, and step 2 is elimination to form a ketone, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bromocyclohexanol, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the entire mechanism again.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone reacts with Br2 to form a bromide at the alpha position (2-bromocyclohexanone).

2. This bromide is treated with NaOH, which could lead to either substitution or elimination. If it's substitution, it would form cyclohexanone again, but that doesn't help. If it's elimination, it might form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

3. Then, product 2 would be an alkene. Treating with SOCl2 doesn't react, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps the first step is a ring-opening bromination. But I don't recall such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a diaddition of Br2 to the carbonyl, making a 1,2-dibromide. Then, step 2 is elimination to form an alkene. Step 3 is treating the alkene with SOCl2, which doesn't react, so perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the first step is adding Br2 to the carbonyl, making a 1-bromo-2-hydroxy compound. Then, step 2 is elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, but without knowing the exact reactions, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is D)7, but I'm not entirely confident.


The problem involves a sequence of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending with product 4. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone is a six-membered cyclic ketone. Bromine (Br₂) likely adds across the carbonyl group via electrophilic addition, forming a vicinal dibromide. Thus, product 1 is **1,2-dibromocyclohexane**.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH → Product 2**  
   Heating 1,2-dibromocyclohexane with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) leads to an elimination reaction (E2 mechanism), where two equivalents of HBr are removed. This forms **cyclohexene**, a six-membered ring with a double bond.

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂, Pyridine → Product 3**  
   Cyclohexene does not react with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) under normal conditions. This suggests a possible error in the earlier assumption about product 2. However, proceeding with the assumption that product 2 is cyclohexene, product 3 remains undefined in this context.

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)₃ → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)₃) is a strong reducing agent. If product 3 were an acid chloride or a similar reducible compound, it would be reduced to a primary alcohol. However, the exact structure of product 3 is unclear due to the earlier ambiguity.

Given the ambiguity in the reaction sequence, particularly the interaction of cyclohexene with SOCl₂, the final structure of product 4 remains uncertain. Assuming product 4 is a primary alcohol derived from a reduction, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is **7**.

Answer: D
