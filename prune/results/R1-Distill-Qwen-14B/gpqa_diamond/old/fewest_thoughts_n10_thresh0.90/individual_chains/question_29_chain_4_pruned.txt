Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene for this compound is identified and has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate the compound by inducing mutations with EMS. They've sequenced the target gene in mutants and found changes in the first exon area. I need to determine which mutation would likely eliminate the compound.

Hmm, so the intact gene and the mutants have sequences for the first part. I remember that exons are the parts of the gene that code for proteins, right? So any mutation in the coding region could affect the protein structure. But how?

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. Let's compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Now, let's look at Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing, the first part is ATGTT in the intact, and in Mutant 1 it's ATGTT. Wait, no, wait. Let me look closer.

Wait, the first part: Intact is ATGTTT, and Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTA... Wait, no, let me line them up properly.

Wait, perhaps I should write each sequence starting from the beginning to see where the mutations are.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA
Wait, the first few bases are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm misaligning. Let me count the letters. Each line is 70 bases approximately.

Wait, perhaps each line is the same length as the original, so let's look at the exact point where the mutation is.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look for where the nucleotides differ between each mutant and the original.

Intact gene: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first part:
ATGTTCTA vs the intact which is ATGTTTCT?

Wait, the first six nucleotides of the intact are ATGTTT. In Mutant 1, it's ATGTTCT. So that's a change from TTT to TTC at position 4-6? Or position 3-5?

Wait, first 6 bases: Intact is ATGTTT, mutant 1 is ATGTTCT? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me count.

Wait, the first part of the intact gene is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1:

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, so comparing:

Intact: positions 1-6: ATG TTT

Mutant 1: positions 1-6: ATG TTC. So that's a change from TTT to TTC. So at the third position, T becomes C? Wait, third residue is the fourth nucleotide. So the third triplet is TTT, which is the fourth, fifth, sixth positions.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the exact letters.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So, in the first part, the intact is ATGTTTCTCGC... and Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGC...

So in the first part, after ATG, the next 3 nucleotides are TTT in the intact, and TTC in Mutant 1. So, the fourth nucleotide: T to C.

Wait, wait, let me index the positions.

Let me write the first 10 nucleotides of each.

Intact: 1: A, 2: T, 3: G, 4: T, 5: T, 6: T, 7: C, 8: T, 9: C, 10: G, ...

Mutant 1: 1: A, 2: T, 3: G, 4: T, 5: T, 6: C, 7: T, 8: A, 9: C, 10: G, ...

So, positions 4-6: Intact is TTT, Mutant 1 is TTC.

So that's a mutation at position 6: T to C.

So, the sixth nucleotide changes from T to C.

So the codon changes from TTT (which is Phe) to TTC (also Phe). Wait, same amino acid. So that's a silent mutation, no change in the protein.

Then, looking further, the next part: in the intact, after that, it's CGC, but in Mutant 1, it's CGC as well. Wait, no, wait. Wait, looking at position 7-9: Intact is TCG, Mutant 1 has TAC.

So in the intact, positions 7-9: T C G.

Mutant 1: T A C.

So the codon changes. So in the intact, it was TCG, which is Serine. Mutant 1 has TAC, which is Tyrosine. So that's an amino acid change from Ser to Tyr. That might be a missense mutation.

Hmm, but the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Alternatively, if a mutation causes a premature stop codon, that could truncate the protein, making it nonfunctional.

So looking at each mutant:

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So first part: ATGTTCTAA...

Wait, comparing to the intact, after ATG, it's TTC TAA... So if the intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT..., Mutant 2 is ATG TTC TAA GCT...

So the first change is TTT becomes TTC (so position 4: T to C; same amino acid). Then, the next codon would be CTC in intact, but in mutant 2 it's TAA. So the codon becomes TAA.

Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh! So in Mutant 2, the second codon after the initial ATG is TTC (Phe), then the next codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be truncated early. That could disrupt the function of the protein, possibly eliminating the compound.

But wait, the question says the gene's exons are in the first exon area. Wait, the mutations are in the first exon area, so the exons are coding.

Wait, but the question says the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized because of the gene. So if we disrupt the gene, the compound won't be made, so the plant would lose that trait.

So Mutant
