Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point, like a mass on a spring. But wait, this is the relativistic version, which means we have to consider special relativity effects, right?

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass, v_max. The options are A to D, each a different formula. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found by energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is converted into kinetic energy. So, in non-relativistic, it's (1/2)mv_max^2 = (1/2)kA^2. Solving, v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be option C, but wait, the question is relativistic, so maybe I can't use that directly.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are significant fractions of the speed of light. So we need to use relativistic equations of motion or energy. The key here is to use the relativistic energy equation.

In special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, for the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. At maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential as in the classical case. Or is it? Let me think. No, in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So the total energy E = kinetic + potential. So E = (gamma -1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

At maximum amplitude A, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is (gamma0 -1)mc², where gamma0 is gamma evaluated at v=0, which is 1. So gamma0 is 1, so KE there is 0. So E = (1/2)kA². 

But at the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, v_max. At that point, all the energy is kinetic. So, E = gamma(v_max) mc².

So setting these equal: (1/2)kA² = gamma(v_max) mc².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed comes from when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But in relativity, it's similar but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is (gamma -1) mc². 

But wait, the total energy is the same at all points because energy is conserved. So when x=A, the potential is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is zero. So E = (1/2)kA². When x=0, E = (gamma -1) mc². So (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is different. Oh wait, no, the potential is the same as classical, just (1/2)kx², but the kinetic term is relativistic.

So, if I proceed with this, then at x=0, E = K. At x=A, E = U.

So, E = (gamma(v_max) -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Rearranging, gamma(v_max) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

So gamma(v_max) = [ (2 mc²) + kA² ] / (2 mc²) ) [Wait, no, let me redo: (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc² → gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²) ).

So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max²)/(c²)) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2 mc²) as a term for simplicity. Let's say (kA²)/(2 mc²) = a. Then,

gamma = 1 + a.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Let me solve for v. Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ].

So, v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ] )

Substituting a back in, a = (kA²)/(2 mc²), so:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²) ) )^2 )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²) = (2 mc² + kA² )/(2 mc² )

So, (1 + a ) = (2 mc² + kA² )/(2 mc² )

So, 1/( (1 + a )^2 ) = (2 mc² )^2 / (2 mc² + kA² )^2

Wait, but let me see the expression for v_max again:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/( (1 + a )^2 ) ] )

Which is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ (2 mc² )^2 / (2 mc² + kA² )^2 ] )

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as:

1 - [1/( (1 + a )^2 ) ] = [ (1 + a )^2 -1 ] / (1 + a )^2 )

Wait, let me compute numerator: (1 + a )^2 -1 = 1 + 2a + a² -1 = 2a +a².

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a +a²) / (1 + a )^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a ) ) / (1 + a ) )

But a is (kA²)/(2 mc²). So,

a = (k A^2 ) / ( 2 m c^2 )

Plugging back in:

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c² )) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )) ) )

Let me factor out (k A²)/(2 m c²) in the numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach would help. Let me compute the term inside the square root.

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ]:

1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 = [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2 = [ 1 + 2a + a² -1 ] / (1 + a )^2 = (2a + a²) / (1 + a )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) / (1 + a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, but perhaps this isn't leading me to a clear answer. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m )) )^2 )

Wait, that seems different.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c² )) )

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Hmm, from my earlier calculation, I have:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + a )^2 ] )

Which is sqrt( ( (1 + a )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a )^2 )

Which simplifies to sqrt( (2a + a² ) / (1 + a )^2 )

But perhaps I should express it in terms of a.

Wait, another approach. Let's calculate v_max in terms of a.

From the equation:

gamma = 1 + a,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))

So,

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - (v^2/c^2))

gamma^2 (1 - v²/c² ) = 1

gamma^2 - gamma^2 v^2 / c^2 = 1

Rearranged,

gamma^2 v^2 / c^2 = gamma^2 -1

v^2 = c² (gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma^2

v = c sqrt( (gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma^2 )

= c sqrt( 1 - 1/gamma^2 )

But gamma is 1 + a, so:

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is what I had earlier.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

With a = (k A^2 )/( 2 m c² )

So,

1 + a = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/(1 + a )^2 = [2 m c²/(2 m c² + k A² ) ]^2

Wait, let me compute the denominator of the fraction inside the sqrt:

Denominator = (1 + a )^2 = ( (2 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) ) )^2

So,

1/(1 + a
