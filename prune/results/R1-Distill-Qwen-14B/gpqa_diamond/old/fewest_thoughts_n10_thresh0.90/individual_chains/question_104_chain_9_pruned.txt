Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

So, both stars have the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The key here is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for #2 it's 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, but wait. The RV method gives us the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) )^(1/ something... Hmm, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so it's roughly K ≈ (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) ). But wait, since the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like) and the stars are same mass, maybe the M_p and M_* terms are the same for both.

But wait, the problem says the two stars have exactly the same masses. So M_* is same for both. Both planets have similar masses, so M_p is same. The inclination angle i is probably the same as well, assuming it's edge-on, but if they're both circular and detected, I guess the sin i is 1 for both (as they were detected). So the only variable here is the orbital period P.

So the formula simplifies to K proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). Because K would be inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is 5 for Planet 1 and 7 for Planet 2, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant for the same star and planet mass.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). So rearranging, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me set this up properly. Let me write the equations.

For planet 1: K1 = (some constants) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, for planet 2: K2 = (same constants) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

Since M_p, sin i, and M_* are same for both, the ratio K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3 )

So, (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So, rearranging, (K2/K1)^3 = (P1/P2 )

Then, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

We need to find how many times longer P2 is than P1, which is P2/P1.

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Given K1 is 5 and K2 is7, K1/K2 is 5/7. So (5/7)^3 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times the period of P1. Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, wait, that would mean if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then it's shorter, so P2 is shorter than P1. But the question is, how many times longer is P2's period than P1? So if P2 is shorter, the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So the value would be about 0.36, meaning P2 is shorter by that factor.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be A.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula. Because sometimes I might have mixed up the dependency.

Another approach: The RV method's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P * (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ) )^(1/1 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write the exact formula. The correct formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) ] * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to refer to the simplified version when M_p << M_*, which is the case here. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and sin i ≈
