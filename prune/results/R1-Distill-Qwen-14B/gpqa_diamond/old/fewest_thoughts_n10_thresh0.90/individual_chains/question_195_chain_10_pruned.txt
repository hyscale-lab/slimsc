Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question talks about a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet has an orbital period of 3 days. The question is asking about the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size. The second planet should also exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm. So transit and occultation events. I remember that transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so we don't see its light. For both to happen, the second planet must be in a position where it can pass in front (transit) and also be eclipsed by the star (occultation). 

Wait, but how does the orbital period factor into this? I think it has to do with their orbital periods and the chances of them aligning correctly so that both events happen. Oh, right, this is about orbital resonance or conjunctions.

Wait, no. Maybe it's about the Hill sphere or the Roche limit? No, that's more about gravitational stability. Wait, no. Since both planets are in the same system and same plane, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital speeds allow them to sometimes be in the right positions.

Wait, but maybe it's more about the distance from the star. Because orbital period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law. So if I can find the orbital radius of the first planet, I can figure out the possible distances for the second planet to have a longer period, but still in a position where their orbits can have the required geometry for transits and occultations.

Another thought: For both events to occur, the second planet's orbit must be such that, from our perspective, it can sometimes be in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). So the orbital period of the second planet must be such that it's in the same line of nodes or something. Oh, but wait, maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the orbital periods being in a ratio that allows them to align properly for transits and occultations.

Wait, perhaps it's about the synodic period. The time between similar configurations, like when the two planets are aligned in the same way relative to the star and Earth. For transits and occultations to occur, the orbital periods must allow for the alignment of both planets such that the second planet can pass in front of the star (transit) and also be behind the star from our viewpoint (occultation).

Alternatively, maybe the two planets must be in a configuration where their orbital periods are such that the second planet's orbital period is longer than the first's. But the question is about the maximum possible period for the second planet to still have both events.

Wait, thinking again. The first planet has a 3-day orbital period. Let's denote it as P1 = 3 days, R1 = Earth radius, R_star = 1.5 * Sun radius. The second planet, P2 (what we're solving for), R2 = 2.5 Earth radii.

Wait, but how do these factors affect the orbital periods and the events?

Wait, I remember that for a planet to transit, it must pass directly in front of the star from our line of sight. The transit impact parameter being 0.2 means that the planet doesn't pass exactly through the center of the star; it's off by 0.2 times the star's radius. But how does that affect the problem? Maybe it tells us about the alignment but perhaps isn't crucial for the orbital period calculation.

Wait, maybe the key is about the relative positions of the two planets. For both to have their transits and occultations observed, the second planet's orbital period must be such that it can sometimes be between us and the star (transit) and sometimes behind the star (occultation). So the orbital period of the second planet must be longer than the first's? No, wait, longer orbital periods mean they are farther out, so they orbit slower. But if the second planet is farther out (longer period), then the first planet would lap it, so they could align in front and behind.

Wait, maybe the maximum period is determined by the condition that the second planet's orbital period is such that the first planet can sometimes catch up to it, allowing for alignment. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the maximum period P2 such that the second planet's orbit is not so much longer that it never transits. So using Kepler's third law to find the possible orbital distances.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that (P^2) / (a^3) is constant for a given star. So if I can find the semi-major axis (a) for the first planet, I can relate it to the second's a and find P2.

Yes, let's calculate a for the first planet. The formula is:

P^2 = (4 * π² * a^3) / (G * M_star)

But since we're looking for a ratio, perhaps we can use the fact that for the same star, the ratio of P^2 is proportional to a^3.

But wait, the first planet has a period of 3 days. Let's compute a1 for the first planet.

The mass of the star is 1.5 times the Sun's mass. Let me denote M_star = 1.5 * M_sun.

Wait, so for the first planet, P1 =3 days. Using Kepler's third law in astronomical units (AU) and years might be easier.

Wait, but 3 days is equal to 3/365 ≈ 0.008219 years.

Wait, but Kepler's third law in these units is P^2 = a^3 / (M_star), where P is in years, a in AU, and M_star in solar masses.

Wait, no, the exact form is P² = (4π²/GM) a³, but when using units where P is in years, a is in AU, and M is solar masses, the formula simplifies to P² = a³ / M.

Wait, no, the correct form is P² = a³ / (M_star), but only when using certain units. Wait, actually, the general form is P² = (4π² a³)/(G M), but for a star of mass M in solar masses, a in AU, P in years, the formula becomes P² = a³ / (M), because when M is solar mass, a is in AU, and P is in years, the constants simplify.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The exact Kepler's third law is:

P² = (4π² * a³) / (G (M + m)) )

But since the planet's mass is negligible, it's P² = (4π² a³) / (G M)

When M is in solar masses, a in AU, P in years,

We can write this as P² (yr) = (a (AU))³ / (M (solar masses)) )

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me look it up in my mind.

Wait, the version I remember is that when you're using AU, years, and solar masses, the formula becomes:

P² = a^3 / (M_star) )

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if M_star is the same as the Sun's, then for Earth, which is 1 AU, P is 1 year, so P² =1 = 1^3 / 1 → 1=1. So that works. But if M is larger, say 2, then for a planet at 1 AU, P² would be 1/2 → P= ~0.707 years, which is about 258 days, which is correct because a more massive star would have a planet orbiting faster at the same distance.

So for a star more massive, same a, P is smaller. So our formula is correct: P² = a³ / M_star.

So for the first planet:

P1 = 3 days = 3/365 ≈ 0.008219 years.

So, (0.008219)^2 = a1^3 / (1.5)

Compute a1^3 = (0.008219)^2 * 1.5

Let me compute 0.008219 squared: about 0.00006755.

Multiply by 1.5: 0.000101325.

So a1^3 = 0.000101325 → a1 ≈ cube root of 0.000101325.

Cube root of 0.0001 is about 0.0464 (since 0.0464^3 ≈ 0.000099). So a1 is approximately 0.046 AU.

Wait, that's the distance of the first planet from the star.

Now, the second planet's distance a2 is determined by Kepler's law as well. But since it's looking for the maximum period P2, which would correspond to the maximum possible a2 such that the planet can still transit. Wait, but what constrains the maximum a2?

Wait, for the second planet to transit, its orbit must be such that, from our line of sight, the planet can pass in front of the star. But the transit depends on the orbital distance and the inclination. But since the problem says to assume same orbital plane, so same inclination. So the second planet's orbit is in the same plane, so transits can happen if the orbital distance allows the planet to reach the line of sight.

Wait, but how to find the maximum a2 for which the second planet can transit. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the maximum a2 is when the orbital distance is such that the planet's orbital speed is such that it can catch up to the first planet in the same system, allowing for transits and occultations.

Alternatively, thinking about conjunctions and oppositions: for a planet to transit, it must be aligned between us and the star. For occultation, it must be on the opposite side. So, the two planets must have orbital periods such that they can be in the same line of sight from Earth at different times.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the second planet must have an orbital period longer than the first's, but not too long that the first planet never catches up, making transits impossible.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the Hill sphere or the concept of orbital stability. The second planet must be within the Hill sphere of the star, but that might not directly apply here.

Wait, another approach: For both planets to experience both transit and occultation events, their orbital periods must be in such a way that they can align in front and behind the star relative to us. So the periods must be in a ratio that allows this.

Wait, when two planets have orbital periods P1 and P2, the synodic period is S = 1/(1/P1 - 1/P2). The synodic period is the time between similar alignments (like when they're in the same relative positions as seen from Earth). For the second planet to be able to transit and occultate, they must have a synodic period that allows these events.
