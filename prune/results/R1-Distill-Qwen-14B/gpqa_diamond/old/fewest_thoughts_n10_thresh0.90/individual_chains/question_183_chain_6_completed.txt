Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the index of hydrogen deficiency in the product after a reaction. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So it's a cyclohexene ring, which already tells me there's a double bond somewhere. The substituents are formyl (which is a CHO group) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5. Also, there's a carboxylic acid group (COOH) attached. Wait, no, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is at position 1, I think, since the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid.

So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, position 2 has a formyl group, and position 5 has a vinyl group. So, the substituents are at 2, 5, and the ring has a double bond between 3 and 4.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh wait, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no, that's another reaction. Alternatively, wait, when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus. Oh, right! It's a way to perform the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but wait, red phosphorus and HI is another way to do a similar reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. So, it would reduce the aldehyde group (CHO) to CH₂OH? Or wait, no, Clemmensen usually gives alkanes. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, another possibility is the reduction of carbonyl groups. Wait, with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's the Wurtz reaction? No, Wurtz is for coupling alkyl halides with metals.

Wait, another thought: The reaction of red phosphorus and HI is used to reduce alkenes. Oh wait, no, that's the hydrohalogenation? Or maybe it's for dihydroxylation? No, that's with other reagents. Alternatively, red phosphorus might be involved in the phosphorus tribromide reaction for eliminating OH groups, but that's not it here.

Hold on, perhaps I'm getting this confused. Another approach: the starting material has a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). So, when reacting with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the formyl group is being reduced. Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones and aldehydes to CH₂ groups. So, the CHO would become CH₂OH? Wait, but wait, I thought Clemmensen gives CH₂ groups, not CH₂OH. Wait, no, let me think again. Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg), which is a strong reducing agent. The reaction reduces ketones to alkanes. For example, R-CO-R' becomes R-CH₂-R' after reduction.

Wait, but with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait! I think I remember that red phosphorus and HI can be used to perform the oxidation of alkenes. Wait no, oxidation would add something. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product's index of hydrogen deficiency. The index is calculated based on the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X here, the formula is (2C +2 - H)/2.

So, whatever the product is, I need to figure out its structure. Let's think about the reaction first.

The starting material has a formyl group and a vinyl group attached to a cyclohexene ring. So, the substituents are:
- At position 2: CHO
- At position 5: CH₂=CH-
And the ring has a double bond between 3 and 4.

Now, reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. Let me think about what each part does. Red phosphorus is often used as a reducing agent. HI is a strong acid and can act as a nucleophile.

Wait, I think I've heard that when a carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone) reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a reduction. For example, the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced. Let me think: in Clemmensen, the aldehyde becomes CH₂OH. Wait, no, in Clemmensen, the aldehyde becomes CH₂ group. Because Clemmensen is a strong reducing condition. Wait, no, wait: wait, if it's an aldehyde, RCHO, Clemmensen would reduce it to RCH₂H, which is R-CH₂-.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for ketones and amines and uses hydrazine and heat. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formyl group is being converted into a CH₂ group. So, the CHO would become CH₂OH if it's something like a ketone. Wait, no, Clemmensen reduces the carbonyl to methylene. Wait, wait, let me get this right. In the Clemmensen reduction, aldehydes are reduced to primary alkanes. So, an aldehyde RCHO becomes RCH₂H, which is RCH3? No, wait, R is already attached. Wait, no, for an aldehyde, like R-CHO, the reduction would give R-CH₂- something? Maybe R-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, perhaps the aldehyde (CHO) is directly reduced to CH₂OH? Or wait, in the presence of HI, perhaps it's an addition instead.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure of the product.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene-carboxylic acid. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5. Wait, no, the cyclohexene is at position 3, so the ring has a double bond between carbon 3 and 4. Positions 2 and 5 have substituents: 2-formyl and 5-vinyl.

So the ring structure is:

1 is the carboxylic acid (COOH), 2 is CHO (formyl), 3 and 4 are double bonded (cyclohex-3-ene), and 5 is CH₂CH₂ (vinyl, which is CH₂=CH- as a substituent).

Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5. Wait, no, the ring has six members. So positions 1 is the COOH, 2 is CHO, 3 and 4 are double bonded, and 5 is the vinyl group.

So, when reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the double bonds in the ring and the vinyl group are affected.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI—what do they do to alkenes? I think red phosphorus can be used in the hydroxylation of alkenes, but wait, that's more with other conditions, like with H2O2. Alternatively, in the presence of HI, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? Or perhaps a hydration?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense here.

Wait, another angle: The starting material has multiple double bonds. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond (1 DoU), the vinyl group has another double bond (another DoU), and the formyl group is a carbonyl (another DoU). So the starting material's DoU is 3.

Wait, but the question is about the product's DoU. So perhaps the reaction reduces some of these double bonds.

Wait, if the reaction reduces the aldehyde (CHO) group to CH₂OH, that would remove a DoU. Because the CHO has a double bond (C=O), so that's one DoU. If it's reduced to CH₂OH, which would be a single bond, so that DoU is gone.

But wait, the aldehyde is a carbonyl group, which is a DoU. So the starting material has three DoU: cyclohexene (1), vinyl group (another 1), and the aldehyde (another 1). So total DoU is 3.

Now, the reaction: when the formyl group is reduced, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes a single bond, so that DoU is lost. So the product would have two DoU left: the cyclohexene and the vinyl group.

Wait, but wait, what about the cyclohexene and the vinyl group? What happens to them in the reaction? If the reaction conditions are HI and red phosphorus, which is a strong acid and a reducing agent, perhaps they are adding to the double bonds.

Wait, but another thought: the reaction could be adding HI across the double bonds, which would break the double bonds and add HI, thereby saturating them. So, each double bond would add two H and two I, but that's probably not the case here because red phosphorus is involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder type addition, but that's usually with dienes and dienophiles, which doesn't seem to fit here.

Wait, another approach: what happens when a cyclohexene ring is treated with HI and red phosphorus? Maybe the ring remains as it is, and the substituents are modified.

So, let's assume the aldehyde group (CHO) is reduced to CH₂OH. That would remove one DoU from the product. So the product would have two DoU: from the cyclohexene and the vinyl group.

Wait, but what if the other double bonds are also affected? Let me think.

The vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, which is a substituent on the ring. When treated with HI, perhaps it undergoes some addition. Wait, in the presence of a reducing agent like red phosphorus, maybe the vinyl group is also reduced. So, the CH₂=CH- group would become CH₂CH₂-, but that's not possible because that would require adding two hydrogens. Oh wait, no, the vinyl group would be saturated. So CH₂=CH- becomes CH₂CH₂-? But that's not possible. Wait, when you reduce a double bond, you add two hydrogens. So CH₂=CH- would become CH₂-CH₂-, which is a single bond. So the vinyl group is converted into an ethyl group.

Wait, but I thought that addition of HI across a double bond would give a dihalide, but with red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, maybe the red phosphorus and HI are causing an acid-catalyzed addition to the double bonds.

Wait, let me think again about the reaction. The starting material has a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a cyclohexene double bond. So that's three double bonds (if we count the cyclohexene as one, the vinyl as another, and the formyl as a third). So three DoU.

After the reaction, if the formyl group is reduced (removes one DoU), the cyclohexene and the vinyl group could each be hydrogenated, each removing a DoU. So if both are hydrogenated, that would remove two DoU. So the product would have zero DoU.

Wait, but would both the cyclohexene and the vinyl groups be hydrogenated? Let's think about the reaction conditions.

Red phosphorus and excess HI. Another thought: perhaps the HI is acting as a source of H+ and I- in an acid-catalyzed reaction. So, in such conditions, maybe the double bonds undergo protonation, but that doesn't necessarily lead to hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are undergoing some addition or hydration.

Another possibility is that the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) reacts with HI, adding HI across the double bond. So CH₂=CH- would become CH₂-I-CH2- something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the starting material has a formyl group, and the reaction conditions are HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the formyl group is getting reduced. So, the CHO becomes CH₂OH. That's one DoU removed.

Now, what about the other double bonds? If the reaction conditions aren't strong enough to reduce the cyclohexene and the vinyl group, then those DoU would remain. So the product would have two DoU.

But wait, red phosphorus is a reducing agent. Maybe it's sufficient to reduce all the double bonds.

Wait, when HI is used with red phosphorus, perhaps it's a way to effect the reduction of all double bonds. So, any double bonds in the molecule would be hydrogenated, breaking the double bonds and adding hydrogen.

In that case, the cyclohexene ring (which had a double bond) would become cyclohexane, thus losing one DoU. The vinyl group (another DoU) would be hydrogenated to an ethyl group, losing another DoU. The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH₂OH, losing another DoU.

Wait, but wait, when the formyl group is reduced, it's a carbonyl group; reducing that would add two hydrogens, making it CH₂OH. So, the formyl group, which had one DoU, now becomes a single bond, so that DoU is lost.

So, the starting material has three DoU. If all three are reduced, the product has zero DoU.

But wait, the product would have a cyclohexane ring (no double bond, so no DoU there), the vinyl group becomes an ethyl group (no double bond, so no DoU), and the formyl becomes CH₂OH (no DoU). So the product would have zero DoU.

So, the index of hydrogen deficiency would be zero.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about the reaction conditions. Does red phosphorus and HI reduce all double bonds and carbonyls?

Another thought: When formyl group is reduced, it becomes CH₂OH, which is a single bond. The cyclohexene and the vinyl groups, if they are hydrogenated, would add H across their double bonds.

Wait, but in the presence of excess HI, maybe the addition is more likely. For example, the cyclohexene might undergo acid-catalyzed addition of HI, but that would add across the double bond, but not hydrogenate it. Alternatively, if red phosphorus is present, perhaps it's acting as a reducing agent, causing the hydrogenation of the double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the red phosphorus isn't strong enough to reduce the cyclohexene and vinyl groups. Maybe only the formyl group is reduced.

Wait, but another key point: the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Would that affect the reaction? Carboxylic acids are generally not very reactive towards reductions, unless under strong conditions. But in this case, the formyl group is adjacent to the carboxylic acid. Oh wait, wait, no, the formyl is at position 2, and the carboxylic acid is at position 1. So, the ring has substituents at 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond), 5 (CH₂=CH-).

Hmm, perhaps the reaction conditions are such that the aldehyde is reduced, but the other double bonds are unaffected. So, the product would have two DoU: from the cyclohexene and the vinyl group.

Wait, but that would mean the product has an index of 2. But that option isn't present. The options are 1,3,5,0.

Wait, the options don't have 2, so perhaps I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, let me recount the starting material's DoU.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the cyclohexene ring has one double bond (DoU=1). The formyl group is a carbonyl (DoU=1). The vinyl group is a double bond (DoU=1). So, total of 3 DoU.

If the reaction reduces the formyl group (removing 1 DoU), and the other two double bonds (the cyclohexene and the vinyl) are also reduced (each removing 1 DoU), then the product would have 0 DoU.

So, the product is a completely saturated molecule.

Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 0.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.

So, the answer should be D) 0.


The compound given, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, contains three double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (C3=C4), one in the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), and one in the formyl group (C=O). Each double bond contributes to the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU), giving the starting material a total of 3 DoU.

When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the reaction conditions suggest a reduction process. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent, and HI provides the necessary acidic environment. The formyl group (C=O) is reduced to a CH₂OH group, eliminating one DoU. Additionally, the double bonds in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group are likely reduced, converting them into single bonds. This eliminates the remaining two DoU.

The product, therefore, is fully saturated with no double bonds remaining. The index of hydrogen deficiency for the product is 0.

Answer: D
