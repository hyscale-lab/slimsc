Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem says that iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. Oh wait, wait. So that means the population of a certain energy level in star 1 is twice that of star 2. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, I think the ground state and an excited state are being considered. Let's say E_i is higher than E_j. Oh wait, wait. If the energy level in star 1 is more excited, does that mean more atoms are in a higher energy state? So for star 1, N_i is twice that of star 2. Or wait, maybe N_i is the higher energy level. So for star 1, N_i = 2 * N_j, assuming N_j is in star 2? Or wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So I think that implies that the ratio N_i,N1 / N_j,N1 = 2 * (N_i,N2 / N_j,N2). Or perhaps N_i for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

Wait, no, maybe I should clarify. The number of atoms in the excited state in star 1 is twice that in star 2. So N1_i = 2 * N2_i (assuming same energy level in both stars). Or wait, but maybe it's more accurate to compare the ratio of excited to lower states.

Wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so each star's photosphere follows the Boltzmann equation independently.

The ratio of the populations in the two energy levels for each star would be given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, for star 1, the ratio is N1_upper / N1_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ), where ΔE is the energy difference (1.38e-23 J). Similarly, for star 2, N2_upper / N2_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think that means (N1_upper / N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper / N2_lower). Because star_1 has twice the excitation level, so the ratio of upper to lower is double that of star_2.

So putting it together:

(g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * [ (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Oh, the g factors (statistical weights) would cancel out because they're
