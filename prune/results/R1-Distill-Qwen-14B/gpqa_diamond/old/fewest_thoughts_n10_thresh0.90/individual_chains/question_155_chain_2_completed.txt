Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty. Hmm, let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, we've got this operator P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz. The matrices for each are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The specific state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty ΔPz.

Wait, right. The uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for Pz, it'll be sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, the state is given as an eigenstate of Px. So in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors, this state might not be an eigenstate. So I'll probably need to express the state in the Pz basis, then compute the expectation values.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ directly in the given state.

Wait, the given state is in the Pz basis, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state is already expressed in the Pz eigenbasis. Oh, that's helpful.

So the state |ψ⟩ is represented by the column vector ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. Let me write that as a vector:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
      [ 1/√2 ]
      [ -1/2 ]

Since the basis is the Pz eigenbasis, the components of ψ are the eigenvalues of Pz. So each component corresponds to a different eigenvalue of Pz.

Wait, wait. Let me think. In the eigenbasis of Pz, the operator Pz is diagonal. So each basis vector |k⟩ is an eigenstate of Pz with eigenvalue say, p_z^k.

So the state ψ is a linear combination of these |k⟩ states. So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can just sum the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, let's consider that. The state ψ is a vector in the Pz basis. Each basis vector |n⟩ corresponds to an eigenvalue p_z^n. So when ψ is expressed as a combination of |n⟩, the coefficients are the probabilities, and the expectation value is the sum of |c_n|^2 * p_z^n.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of Pz in its eigenbasis. Because the matrix of Pz is diagonal, each diagonal entry is an eigenvalue. From the given Pz matrix:

Pz matrix is:
[ ħ   0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0 -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So for the basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

Wait, no, wait. The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So if the basis is |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, then Pz |1⟩ = ħ |1⟩, Pz |2⟩ = 0 |2⟩, Pz |3⟩ = -ħ |3⟩.

So the state ψ is written as:

ψ = (-1/2) |1⟩ + (1/√2) |2⟩ + (-1/2) |3⟩.

Wait, but let me check the components: the first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for |1⟩ (which has eigenvalue ħ), the second is 1/√2 for |2⟩ (eigenvalue 0), and the third is -1/2 for |3⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ).

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, it's the sum of |amplitude|^2 * corresponding eigenvalue.

So for each component:

First term: |-1/2|^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ.

Second term: |1/√2|^2 * 0 = (1/2)*0 = 0.

Third term: |-1/2|^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)*(-ħ).

So adding them up: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the expectation value of Pz squared. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz² is also diagonal, with each element squared.

So the eigenvalues for Pz² are (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2. So all are ħ², 0, ħ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = sum |c_n|^2 * (p_z^n)^2.

Compute each term:

First term: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = ħ²/4.

Second term: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third term: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = ħ²/4.

Adding them up: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2. And ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so (⟨P_z⟩)^2 is zero.

So the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, the given state is in the eigenstate of Px. But when calculating the expectation value for Pz, I don't need to worry about that because the state is already expressed in the Pz basis. So my approach is correct.

Yes, that's right. The state is given in the Pz basis, so the components are the respective projections onto each eigenstate. So calculating the expectation values as I did is correct.

So, the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system's state is given as the column vector $\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$ in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. In this basis, the operator $P_z$ is diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ corresponding to the basis states $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. The state $\psi$ can thus be expressed as:

\[
\psi = -\frac{1}{2} |1\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |2\rangle - \frac{1}{2} |3\rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, where the weights are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is similarly calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
