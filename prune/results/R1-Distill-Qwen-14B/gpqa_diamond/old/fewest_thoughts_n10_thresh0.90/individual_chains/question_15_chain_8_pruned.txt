Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But in this question, they've already detected the planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. So the main factors here are probably the orbital period, the star's size, and the planet's size. Wait, but actually for transit probability, I think the key factors are the size of the star and the size of the planet, and the inclination of the orbit. But since the RV method doesn't require the planet to transit (unlike transits), but the question is about the probability of transit occurring if they observe it. Oh wait, no, the question is about which planet is more likely to transit, so when they observe, which has a higher chance of being in the right alignment.

I remember that the probability P of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), the probability simplifies to P = (R_p / a) / (R_* ), where R_p is the planet's radius, R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but for small planets compared to stars, R_planet is negligible, so P ≈ (R_star) / a. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the formula is P = R_* / a, because the planet has to pass in front of the star, which depends on the relative sizes. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p + R_* ) / a, but more accurately, P = (R_* + R_p) / (a), but since R_p << R_*, it's approximately R_* / a. But wait, another thought: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth compared to the area the planet can cover, which translates into the probability that the orbital plane is aligned so that the planet passes in front. Alternatively, the probability can be approximated as (R_* / a) * (something else), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the probability is (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by 1/(1 - e²)^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's (R_* / a)^2. But that's for the area. But wait, that would be the area of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. So the probability of a transit is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere of radius a around the star. Hmm, that might not be right.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the solid angle. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability of this is the ratio of the star's disk area to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbital plane presents as seen from Earth. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Another approach: the probability that a randomly oriented orbit causes a transit is given by P = (R_* / a) * (1 / (sin i)), where i is the inclination. But for a random inclination, the average sin i is 1/2, so maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, I think the formula for the probability is P = (R_* / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_* / M_p)^(1/3))) ), but wait, that might be a different factor. Alternatively, I've read that the probability for a planet to transit is roughly (R_* / a), assuming circular orbits and random orientation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the formula. From what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting is when the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is exactly edge-on. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance. So P = (R_* / a). But wait, another thought: if the orbital distance is a, then the cross-section for a transit is π R_*^2, and the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit sweeps is 4π a². So the probability would be (π R_*²) / (4π a²) ) = (R_*^2) / (4 a²). Wait, that would make P = (R_*)/(2a) )^2. So the square of (R_* / 2a). Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is
