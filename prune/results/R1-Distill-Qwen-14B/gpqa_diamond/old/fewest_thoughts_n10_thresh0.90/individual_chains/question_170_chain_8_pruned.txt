Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a particular spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I think that notation means a two-component vector where the first component is 3i and the second is 4. So the spin state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T, right?

The options are multiple-choice, and I need to compute the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value of an observable is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator for the observable. So for S_y, the operator is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i.

So first, I should write down the spin operator σ_y. From the note, σ_y is a matrix:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times this matrix.

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is then ψ† S_y ψ. Let me write that out. So, ψ is the column vector [3i; 4], so ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], which since 3i is imaginary, its complex conjugate is -3i. So ψ† is [-3i, 4].

Now, let me compute S_y ψ. Let's compute σ_y multiplied by ψ.

σ_y ψ = [0  -i; i 0] * [3i; 4] = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) , (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T.

Wait, no, matrix multiplication. Each component is row times column.

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Then, S_y ψ is (ħ/2)*[ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, ψ† S_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) times [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, let me compute the inner product ψ† (σ_y ψ) first, then multiply by ħ/2.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Calculating each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². i squared is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them together: (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that matrix multiplication. Oh no, wait, when you multiply ψ† (σ_y ψ), the first term is (3i*) * (first component of σ_y ψ), and the second is (4*) * (second component of σ_y ψ). So ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† is [3i*, 4*]. 3i* is -3i, and 4* is 4.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = ?

Let me compute each part:

First part: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second part: 4*(-3) = -12.

So the total is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Then, the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this, so (ħ
