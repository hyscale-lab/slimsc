Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics and approximations made in many-body calculations. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question says that in some calculations, like electroweak interactions, nucleons are treated as if they're free. The question is asking which of the four assumptions lead to this "impulse" approximation.

So the options are four statements (1-4), and I have to choose which combination (A to D) are correct. Let me break down each statement.

Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That makes sense because if the current only interacts with each nucleon separately, you can treat them as if they're free, right? Because each one is responding only to the external field without considering others. So this assumption probably supports the impulse approximation.

Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, what does transparent mean here? I think it means that other nucleons don't affect the interaction. So if the nucleus is mostly transparent except for the one nucleon being hit, that would imply that the other nucleons don't interfere. So the selected nucleon is acting independently, which again supports the idea that it's behaving like a free particle. So statement 2 would be part of the assumptions for the impulse approximation.

Statement 3: The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, non-relativistic quarks. I'm not too sure about this. Wait, in the impulse approximation, are we considering the internal structure of the nucleon? Or are we treating the nucleon as a point particle? If the quarks are non-relativistic, that might affect how the nucleon responds. If they're relativistic, maybe the internal dynamics are more complicated. But how does that tie into the approximation?

Wait, the impulse approximation treats the nucleon as free, so perhaps it neglects the internal dynamics. But statement 3 is about quarks being non-relativistic. If the quarks are non-relativistic, does that mean that the nucleon's internal structure can be treated in a simple way? Or does it not affect the approximation that the nucleon behaves as free?

I'm a bit confused here. Let's think: the impulse approximation is when the interaction is so short that the nucleon doesn't have time to respond as a bound system. So the nucleon's internal structure (quarks) isn't much affected. So maybe whether the quarks are relativistic or not affects the treatment of their dynamics, but how does that relate to the assumption of the impulse approximation?

Alternatively, if the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps the approximation holds because their motion is simpler. But I'm not sure if statement 3 is a required assumption for the impulse approximation.

Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, that makes sense. If the nucleon is not bound (no binding forces), then it can be treated as free. So statement 4 is directly implying that the nucleon is free, which is a key part of the approximation.

So, which of the four statements are correct? The question says, which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation.

So the impulse approximation assumes that each nucleon acts independently and that their binding doesn't matter during the interaction.

So statement 1: correct, because it's about individual interactions.

Statement 2: correct, because other nucleons don't affect the interaction—so nucleus is mostly transparent except for the target nucleon.

Statement 3: Not sure. Maybe it's not directly related. The impulse approximation doesn't consider the internal structure (quarks) in detail, I think. So maybe statement 3 is not an assumption of the impulse approximation.

Statement 4: correct, because the binding forces are ignored.

So the correct statements are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options:

Option A is 1,2,4, which would be correct. Option B includes 2,3,4—so if statement 3 is not correct, then B is out. Option C is 1,2,3; if 3 is not needed, C is wrong. Option D is 1,3,4; no.

Wait, but earlier I thought statement 3 might not be part of the assumptions. So the correct group is 1,2,4. So the answer would be option A.


The impulse approximation in nuclear physics assumes that nucleons behave as free particles during an interaction. To determine which assumptions jointly imply this approximation, let us analyze the given statements:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This assumption aligns with the impulse approximation because it implies that each nucleon responds independently to the interaction, as if it were free. Thus, this statement supports the approximation.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This means that other nucleons do not interfere with the interaction, allowing the selected nucleon to behave as if it were isolated. This assumption is consistent with the impulse approximation.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: While the impulse approximation neglects the internal structure of the nucleon, the assumption about the quarks being non-relativistic is not directly tied to the approximation. The approximation focuses on the nucleon as a whole, not the internal dynamics of its quarks. Therefore, this statement is not a required assumption for the impulse approximation.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This directly implies that the nucleon is treated as free, as it is not bound by the nuclear force during the interaction. This assumption is fundamental to the impulse approximation.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
