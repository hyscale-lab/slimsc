Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT) and E is the energy of each state.

The system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. But wait, that's correct, right? Because each spin is independent, so 2 options each, multiplied for three spins gives 8 states.

The energy E is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So for each state, I'll need to compute this energy and then calculate e^(-βE) for each, then sum them all to get Z.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the possible values of the terms.

Each term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. For example, S1S2 is +1 if S1 and S2 are the same, and -1 otherwise. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 will vary depending on the configuration.

Let me consider different cases. 

Case 1: All spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all -1. Let's compute the energy. Each S_i S_j would be +1, so sum is 3. So E = -J *3. Then, the Boltzmann factor is e^(-β*(-3J)) = e^(3Jβ).

How many states are there for this case? Well, all spins up or all down, so 2 states.

Case 2: Two spins are the same, and the third is different. Let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Let's compute the sum S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Energy E = -J*(-1) = J. So the Boltzmann factor is e^(-β J) = e^(-Jβ).

How many states are there where exactly two spins are the same? For each pair, the third can be different. Let's see: for each of the three pairs (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3), the third spin can be opposite. But wait, maybe another approach. For three spins, the number of states where two are up and one is down, plus two down and one up. Each of these would have the same energy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If two are up and one is down, how does that affect the sum?

Wait, let's take a specific example. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. The sum is (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = J. Similarly, any state where exactly two spins are the same and the third is different. How many such states are there?

For three spins, the number of ways to have two up and one down is 3, and the number of ways to have two down and one up is another 3. So total of 6 states. Each of these contributes e^(-Jβ) to the partition function.

Wait, but wait a second, let me verify. Wait, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: that's one state. Similarly, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: another. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: another. That's three for two up, one down. Similarly, two down and one up: three more. So total 6 states, each with energy J, so their contribution is 6 * e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but wait! Wait, when we have two down and one up: Let's take S1=S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So same as before, E = J. So each of these 6 states contributes e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but wait, can I double-check the energy for a state where two are same and one different. Let me take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. The sum is 1*(1) + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. So the Boltzmann factor is e^(-β E) = e^(-Jβ). Right.

So Case 1: 2 states, each with E = -3J, so e^(3Jβ) each. So contribution is 2 * e^(3Jβ).

Case 2: 6 states, each with E=J, so e^(-Jβ) each. So contribution is 6 * e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but wait a minute. Are there any other cases? Let me think. Could there be a state where all three are different? Wait, no, because each spin is either +1 or -1. So for three spins, you can't have all three different because you have three spins but only two possible values for each. So the possible cases are either all spins same, or exactly two same and one different. So we have covered all possible 8 states?

Wait, 2 (all same) + 6 (two same, one different) = 8, yes. So that's correct.

So the partition function Z is the sum of all these contributions: 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ). Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options match this exactly. Let me see the options again.

Option A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)
Option B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)
Option C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)
Option D) Z=6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)

So according to my calculation, Z is 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}, which is option B. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, in the energy expression, E is negative J times the sum. So E = -J (sum). So for the case where sum is 3, E is -3J. So Boltzmann factor is e^{-β E} = e^{-β (-3 J)} = e^{3 J β}.

Wait, yes, that's what I have. So 2 e^{3 J β} from the two all-same states, and 6 e^{-J β} from the two-same-one-different states.

So the partition function is Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}, which is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}, yes. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because sometimes, in such systems, the spin couplings can lead to different terms, but in this case, I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of states. Let me recount.

Total states: 8.

Case 1: All up or all down: that's two states.

Case 2: Two up, one down: how many?

We can choose which spin is down. So 3 options. Similarly, two down and one up: another 3. So total 6 states.

2 + 6 =8, correct.

So yes, my initial calculation seems correct. So the partition function is 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}, which is option B.


To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors \( e^{-\beta E} \) for all possible states.

### Step 1: Total number of states
Each spin has 2 possible states (\( +1 \) or \( -1 \)), and there are 3 spins. Thus, the total number of states is \( 2^3 = 8 \).

### Step 2: Classify states based on energy
The energy depends on the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), which can take different values depending on the spin configuration. We classify the states into two cases:

1. **Case 1: All spins are the same**  
   - If \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \), the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \).  
   - Energy: \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).  
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3J\beta} \).  
   - Number of such states: 2 (all up or all down).  
   - Contribution to \( Z \): \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).

2. **Case 2: Two spins are the same, and one is different**  
   - For example, \( S_1 = S_2 = +1 \), \( S_3 = -1 \). The sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \).  
   - Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).  
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-J\beta} \).  
   - Number of such states: 6 (3 ways to choose the different spin for two up and one down, and 3 ways for two down and one up).  
   - Contribution to \( Z \): \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

### Step 3: Total partition function
Summing the contributions from both cases, the partition function is:
\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
From the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs in exponents).  
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).  
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).  
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect coefficients and exponents).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
