Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, but the question is about finding the correct equation that relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2 using the natural logarithm of 2.

Wait, right. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) ), right? So here, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state, or something similar.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to some other state is higher in star_1. Or perhaps the ratio between the two stars is given.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So if we denote n1 as the number in star_1 and n2 as that in star_2, then n1 = 2 n2.

But wait, no, wait. No, because the energy levels are the same for both stars, right? The energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J for both. So the ratio of populations for each star is determined by their respective temperatures.

So for each star, the population ratio is governed by the Boltzmann factor. Let me write the formula:

n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) )

Assuming that the excited state is a higher energy level than the ground state, so E_i > E_j. So the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is positive.

Wait, but in the problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's consider the ground state as j and the excited state as i.

So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is:

n1_excited / n1_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly,

n2_excited / n2_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no, no. The problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So for each star, the number of excited atoms in that level is twice as much for star_1 as for star_2. So n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me read the problem again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So that would mean the number of excited atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, if n1 is the number in star_1 and n2 in star_2, then n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, but the number of atoms in each star might not be the same. But no, because the question is about the ratio within each star. Alternatively, it's the ratio of excited to some other state.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the excited population to the total population. Or perhaps the ratio is the same as the ratio of the excited to the ground state.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each star's situation. Let me denote the number of atoms in the excited state as ni for each star.

So for star 1: ni_1 = some function of T1.

For star 2: ni_2 = some function of T2.

Given that ni_1 = 2 ni_2.

So the ratio ni_1 / ni_2 = 2.

But according to the Boltzmann distribution, ni / nj = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Wait, but let me assume that the ground state is n_ground and the excited is n_excited. Then for each star, the ratio would be:

n_excited / n_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

In star_1: ratio1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

In star_2: ratio2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that n_excited in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, n_excited depends on the total number of atoms as well, right? Because both stars might have different total number of atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n_excited / n_total) for each star. But no, the problem states that the excitation in a specific level is twice. So perhaps the ratio is (n_excited / n_ground) in each star.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the ratio as (n_excited)/(n_ground) for each star. So, for star 1, ratio1 = n1_excited / n1_ground = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, ratio2 = n2_excited / n2_ground = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited. Wait, but that's not necessarily considering their respective ground states. So perhaps the ratio of (n_excited in star1) to (n_excited in star2) is 2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is the same as (n1_excited)/(n2_excited) = 2.

So,

n1_excited / n2_excited = 2.

But each of these is governed by their respective Boltzmann factors.

So,

(n1_excited / n1_ground) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))

Similarly,

(n2_excited / n2_ground) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

If I take the ratio of the two:

(n1_excited / n2_excited) = [ (n1_ground / n2_ground) ) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

But wait, the ratio (n1_excited / n2_excited) = 2 = [ (n1_ground / n2_ground) * exp( (ΔE/k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) ]

But I don't know anything about the ratio of the ground states. Hmm. Maybe that's a problem. So perhaps the question is considering that the ground state populations are the same between the two stars? That doesn't make much sense, because the number of atoms in each star could vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio between the excited and the ground state in each star, and that the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-read the question.

The question says that the number of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So that would mean that the number of excited atoms in that level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

So, for each star, the number of excited atoms is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. But let's think about the ratio between the two stars.

So,

(n1_excited) = 2 (n2_excited)

But each of these is given by:

n1_excited = n_total_1 * (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly,

n2_excited = n_total_2 * (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Assuming the same statistical weights (g_i and g_j) for both stars, then:

n1_excited / n2_excited = (n_total_1 / n_total_2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

But without knowing the ratio of n_total_1 and n_total_2, it's hard to proceed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the number of atoms in the excited state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, so neglecting the total number of atoms. Or perhaps the stars have the same number of iron atoms.

Wait, the problem doesn't state that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that for each star, the ratio of the excited to the ground state is given, and that this ratio is different for the two stars. Then, the ratio between the two stars' excited states is 2.

Let me think: the ratio for star1 is R1 = n1_excited / n1_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, R2 = n2_excited / n2_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that n1_excited = 2 n2_excited.

But without knowing the ratio of the ground states (n1_ground vs n2_ground), I can't directly relate R1 and R2.

Wait, perhaps that's a dead end. Let me think differently.

Wait, if the question is looking for an equation involving ln(2), perhaps the ratio between the two R's is 2.

Wait, but R1 = (n1_excited)/(n1_ground) and R2 = (n2_excited)/(n2_ground).

If (n1_excited) = 2 (n2_excited), but I don't know about the ground states.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of R1 to R2 is 2. So, R1/R2 = 2.

But R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

If this equals 2, then:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

But I don't know if that's the case. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio of their excitation levels is 2. So (n1_excited) / (n2_excited) ) = 2.

But each of these is given by:

n1_excited = n_total_1 * (g_i/(g_j)) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_excited = n_total_2 * (g_i/(g_j)) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Assume that the number of atoms in each star is the same? That's a big assumption, but let's see.

If n_total_1 = n_total_2, then:

(n1_excited)/(n2_excited) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) = 2

Taking the natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Hmm, but none of the answer options have a 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) term. Let me check the options.

Option A: ln(2) = [ T2 / T1 ]

No, that's not matching.

Option B: ln(2) = [ (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm, (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) = 1/T2 + 1/T1. So that would give ln(2) = (1/T1 + 1/T2) * something.

Wait, in my earlier equation, I have 1/T2 - 1/T1. The problem is that the delta E is positive, and the equation I have is ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this case, E_i is the excited state, E_j is the ground state. So E_i - E_j = ΔE is positive.

So,

n_i / n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Now, for star 1, we have n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: n2_i / n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that n1_i = 2 n2_i.

So,

n1_i = 2 n2_i.

But we don't know the ratio of n1_j and n2_j. Hmm.

But maybe the ratio of n1_i to n2_i is equal to the ratio of (n1_j exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (n2_j exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) )

Wait, because n1_i = n1_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, n2_i = n2_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

n1_i / n2_i = [n1_j / n2_j ] * exp( (ΔE/(k T2 )) - (ΔE/(k T1 )) )

Which can be written as [n1_j / n2_j ] * exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But the problem states that this ratio is 2.

So,

2 = [n1_j / n2_j ] * exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

But without knowing [n1_j / n2_j ], this doesn't directly give us an equation between T1 and T2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the ground state populations are the same between the two stars, i.e., n1_j = n2_j.

If that's the case, then n1_j / n2_j = 1. So,

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

But the problem gives ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, what's k? Boltzmann's constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So,

ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So,

ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which implies:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But the options don't have this.

Let's rearrange this equation:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) → 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

Alternatively,

(T1 T2 )/( T2 - T1 ) ) = 1.

Hmm, but the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1 → No.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → Which is (1/T1 + 1/T2 ) = ln(2 )

Wait, that would imply 1/T1 + 1/T2 = ln(2), which is different from our equation which has 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). So not matching.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )^2 → Hmm, not sure.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

1/(T2) - 1/(T1 ) = ln(2 )

Because,

(T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, yes:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 ) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 ) = [ ( T1 - T2 ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Wait, let me compute:

(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) = (T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 )

Which is the same as our equation: ln(2 ) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

Wait, but in our earlier step, we derived ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), which is equal to (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.


To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the populations of energy levels in thermal equilibrium. The distribution is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature of the system.

The problem states that the number of iron atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This gives the ratio:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{excited}}} = 2.
\]

For each star, the population of the excited state relative to the ground state is:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{1,\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of these two expressions:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{excited}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \(\frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{excited}}} = 2\), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
