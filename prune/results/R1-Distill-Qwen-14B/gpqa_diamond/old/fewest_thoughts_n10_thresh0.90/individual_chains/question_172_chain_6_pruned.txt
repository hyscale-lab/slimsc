Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the excitation of iron atoms and the effective temperatures of two stars. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) assumption, the excitation of atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann equation is something like this: (n_upper) / (n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE / (k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, it says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. Wait, so when they say "twice as excited," I think they mean that the population of the upper energy level relative to the lower is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, let's denote n1 as the ratio for star_1 and n2 for star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The problem states that the "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, maybe "twice as excited" refers to the ratio of the excited state population. So for star 1, the population of the specific energy level is twice that of star 2. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the upper to lower level that's twice as high in star_1.

Wait, the question says "twice as excited," which I think refers to the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (upper level) to the ground state (lower level) being higher. So for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2).

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, n_upper / n_lower is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). But wait, the equation is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So assuming that the statistical weights (g_upper/g_lower) are the same for both stars, which they probably are since it's the same element and energy levels. So the ratio of the excitation depends only on the exponential term.

So for star_1, (n_upper1/n_lower1) = (g) exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star_2, (n_upper2/n_lower2) = (g) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Given that n_upper1/n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2/n_lower2), because star_1 is twice as excited. So:

(g exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = 2 * (g exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))

We can cancel the g's because they're the same for both stars. So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Hmm, let's rearrange this. Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let's see:

Let me write that step again. So,

exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )) = 2

Wait, no. Let me double-check.

We have:

exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) ) / exp( (ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2

Wait, no, let's go back. Earlier I had:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Which can be rewritten as:

exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ) = 2

Because 2 is exp(ln(2)), so:

exp( [ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] ) = 2

So taking natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

So, solving for the temperatures, perhaps.

Wait, let's write that as:

ΔE (1/T2 - 1/T1) = k ln(2)

Or,

ΔE ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = k ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

ΔE (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = k ln(2)

Hmm, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, what's the value of k (Boltzmann constant)? It's about 1.38e-23 J/K, exactly. Oh wait, that's interesting. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k, since k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So substituting k into the equation:

(1.38e-23 J) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (1.38e-23 J/K) * ln(2)

We can cancel out the 1.38e-23 terms on both sides:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln 2) / K

Wait, no, because on the right side, it's (1.38e-23 J/K) * ln(2). Let me write it correctly.

Wait, the left side is:

ΔE * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Which equals k * ln(2)

So substituting ΔE=k:

k * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = k * ln(2)

We can divide both sides by k:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see. Option D is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) → which is the same as the equation we have. So that would be option D.

Wait let me check the options again.

Option D says ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that's exactly our equation.

But wait, let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra.

We started with n1 = 2 n2.

Which led us to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -Δ
